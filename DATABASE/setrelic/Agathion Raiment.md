An _agathion raiment_ aids its wearer in finding diplomatic solutions to conflicts when possible, fighting evil directly when it's not, and guiding others along the path to redemption. A red [[DATABASE/monster/Draconal (Dragon Agathion)|draconal agathion]] created five _agathion raiments_ and granted them to [[DATABASE/championcause/Redeemer|redeemer]] [[DATABASE/class_/Champion|champions]] of great valor millennia ago. Since then, virtuous souls of various skill sets have assembled _agathion raiments_. This set functions only for good creatures.

**Gifts**: The set grants the following gifts.

* _1_: [[DATABASE/relic/Word of Faith|word of faith]]
* _2_: [[DATABASE/relic/Feral Claws|feral claws]]
* _3_: [[DATABASE/relic/Righteous Call|righteous call]]
* _4_: [[DATABASE/relic/Form of Fury|form of fury]] (usually canine or cat)

The set grants the following features.

* _Two Items_: Word of faith restores 1d10 Hit Points per relic level and reduces the target's [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] value by 2.
* _Three Items_: The claws you gain from feral claws are magical and deal 1d4 good damage.
* _Four Items_: You and your allies affected by righteous call deal 1d4 additional good damage with successful Strikes, rather than none or 1. This 1d4 stacks with that from your feral claws and damage from the [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy|holy]] rune effect you gain from righteous call.
* _Five Items_: In your form of fury, you have darkvision and gain 20 additional temporary Hit Points, but you have weakness 5 to evil damage. You don't need to change your size to gain the benefits, other than reach, of a higher-level battle form. Also, your unarmed attacks from this form have the _holy_ weapon property rune.
