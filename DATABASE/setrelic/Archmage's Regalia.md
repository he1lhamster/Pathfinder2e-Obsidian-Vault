# Archmage's Regalia

<span class="item-trait">Relic</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Aspects** life and mind

Many [[DATABASE/class_/Wizard|wizards]] have enhanced their spellcasting capabilities with an _archmage's regalia_. Legend tells of such a relic set that belonged to the wizard-king Nex, with powers far beyond that of a typical relic. Although some believe Nex took his regalia with him when he disappeared, several credible reports of items matching their descriptions have surfaced over the years. No one has yet managed to track down all five pieces, and it's possible some have been destroyed or otherwise lost.
