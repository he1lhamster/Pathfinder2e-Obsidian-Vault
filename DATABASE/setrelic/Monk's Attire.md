According to tales, some of the first [[DATABASE/class_/Monk|monks]] to assemble the austere _monk's attire_ were servants of [[DATABASE/deity/Irori|Irori]]. This deity is a symbol of devotion and self-discovery through one's understanding of body, mind, and soul. _Monk's attire_ resonates with Irori's dedication, focusing on the highest gain from minimal acquisition, eschewing material objects. Legend holds Irori did so, and that some famous _monk's attire_ sets include a scrap of Irori's original possessions. Other monastic orders have similar traditions of minimal personal effects, with an emphasis on spiritual focus, practicality, and self-defense.
