A _duelist's blazon_ set relic was once used by a legendary swordmaster, absorbing their verve, tenacity, and daring. Though each set contains the same items, they all have unique styles, from the elegant, rose-themed decor of the blazon of Taldan [[DATABASE/class_/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]] Miralla d'Asivran to the spiked sword and attire of Kuthonite maestro duelist Essinte Zaim. Duelists have been known to challenge one another over the set's components.

The set grants the following features.

* _Two Items_: You can use dominant emotion at will.
* _Three Items_: You can use whammy one additional time per day, but a creature affected by it is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
* _Four Items_: When you use steal luck and get a success or critical success, you're [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] until the end of your next turn.
* _Five Items_: If dominant emotion or emotion conduit counteract an effect, the target gains a brief surge of luck in the form of a d20 they can add to another single d20 roll, taking the highest result. Until used, this die remains with the target until their next daily preparations, and the target can't gain another die from this effect until after that time. Using the die is a fortune effect.
