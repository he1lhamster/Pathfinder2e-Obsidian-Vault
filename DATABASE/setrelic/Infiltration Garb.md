# Infiltration Garb

<span class="item-trait">Relic</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Aspects** death and shadow

---
Several notable [[DATABASE/archetype/Assassin|assassins]], [[DATABASE/rogueracket/Thief|thieves]], and others who work from the shadows have used an _infiltration garb_ over the centuries. The nature of these professions means that such sets are often separated from their audacious users. Due to their association with subterfuge and assassins, sets of infiltration garbs have grim reputations. However, not all wielders use their powers maliciously. Notably, the faithful of Kelinahat, empyreal lord of spies, stealth, and intelligence gathering, view these relics as sacred tools in the fight against evil.
