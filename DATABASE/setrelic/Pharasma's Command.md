# Pharasma's Command

<span class="item-trait">Relic</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Aspects** life and time

[[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma's]] devoted followers vow to seek out and destroy undead wherever they can be found, a task made more urgent with the rise of Tar-Baphon. Though the Whispering Tyrant was prevented from taking over Golarion, his forces are still massing. Undead unaffiliated with the [[DATABASE/monster/Lich|lich]] represent an unacceptable perversion of the cycle of life and death to Pharasmins, and permitting such creatures to exist is anathema to her. To aid her faithful in their sacred duty to send the dead where they belong, Pharasmin priests developed this item set. While using _Pharasma's command_, you must abide by her [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|edicts and anathema]] or else the relic ceases to function for you until you atone. This set doesn't function for undead beings.
