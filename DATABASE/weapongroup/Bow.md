# Bow

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Water|water elemental]] or some [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ooze|oozes]]), or could otherwise escape without effort.
