# Axe

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its _[[Striking]]_ rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
**Weapons** [[Adze]], [[Battle Axe]], [[Battle Saddle]], [[Boarding Axe]], [[Butchering Axe]], [[Dwarven War Axe]], [[Greataxe]], [[Hand Adze]], [[Hatchet]], [[Mambele]], [[Orc Necksplitter]]
