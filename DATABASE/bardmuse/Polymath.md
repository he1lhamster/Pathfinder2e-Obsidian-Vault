# Polymath

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Your muse is a jack of all trades, flitting between skills and pursuits. If it's is a creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey; if a deity, it might be [[DATABASE/deity/Desna|Desna]] or [[DATABASE/deity/Calistria|Calistria]]. As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mind—you want to try everything. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Versatile Performance|Versatile Performance]] feat and add [[DATABASE/spell/Unseen Servant|unseen servant]] to your spell repertoire.
