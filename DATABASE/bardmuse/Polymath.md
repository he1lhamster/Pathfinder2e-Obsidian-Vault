# Polymath

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Your muse is a jack of all trades, flitting between skills and pursuits. If it's is a creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey; if a deity, it might be [[Desna]] or [[Calistria]]. As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mind—you want to try everything. You gain the [[Versatile Performance]] feat and add [[Unseen Servant]] to your spell repertoire.
