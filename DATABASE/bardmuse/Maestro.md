# Maestro

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Your muse is a virtuoso, inspiring you to greater heights. If it's a creature, it might be a performance-loving creature such as a [[Choral (Choir Angel)]] or [[Lillend (Muse Azata)]]; if a deity, it might be [[Shelyn]]. As a bard with a maestro muse, you are an inspiration to your allies and confident of your musical and oratorical abilities. You gain the [[Lingering Composition]] feat and add [[Soothe]] to your spell repertoire.
