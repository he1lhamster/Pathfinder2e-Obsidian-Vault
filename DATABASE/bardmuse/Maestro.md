# Maestro

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Your muse is a virtuoso, inspiring you to greater heights. If it's a creature, it might be a performance-loving creature such as a [[DATABASE/monster/Choral (Choir Angel)|choral angel]] or [[DATABASE/monster/Lillend (Muse Azata)|lillend azata]]; if a deity, it might be [[DATABASE/deity/Shelyn|Shelyn]]. As a bard with a maestro muse, you are an inspiration to your allies and confident of your musical and oratorical abilities. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Lingering Composition|Lingering Composition]] feat and add [[DATABASE/spell/Soothe|soothe]] to your spell repertoire.
