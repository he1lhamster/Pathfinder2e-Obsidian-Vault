**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Your muse is a mystery, driving you to uncover the hidden secrets of the multiverse. If your muse is a creature, it might be a dragon or otherworldly being; if a deity, it might be [[DATABASE/deity/Irori|Irori]] or [[DATABASE/deity/Nethys|Nethys]]. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Bardic Lore|Bardic Lore]] feat and add [[DATABASE/spell/True Strike|true strike]] to your spell repertoire.
