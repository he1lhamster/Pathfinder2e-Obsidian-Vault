**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Your muse is a mystery, driving you to uncover the hidden secrets of the multiverse. If your muse is a creature, it might be a dragon or otherworldly being; if a deity, it might be [[Irori]] or [[Nethys]]. You gain the [[Bardic Lore]] feat and add [[True Strike]] to your spell repertoire.
