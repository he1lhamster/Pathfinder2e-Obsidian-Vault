# Paladin [Lawful Good]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
You’re honorable, forthright, and committed to pushing back the forces of cruelty. You gain the Retributive Strike champion’s reaction and the [[DATABASE/spell/Lay on Hands|lay on hands]] devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:

* You must act with honor, never taking advantage of others, lying, or cheating. 
* You must respect the lawful authority of legitimate leadership wherever you go, and follow its laws.

**Trigger** An enemy damages your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.

You protect your ally and strike your foe. The ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. If the foe is within reach, make a melee Strike against it.

## Divine Smite<span class="item-type">Level 9</span>

## Exalt<span class="item-type">Level 11</span>

When you use Retributive Strike, each ally within 15 feet of you with the target in their melee reach can spend a reaction to Strike the target with a –5 penalty.
