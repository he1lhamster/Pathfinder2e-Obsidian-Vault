# Paladin [Lawful Good]

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
You’re honorable, forthright, and committed to pushing back the forces of cruelty. You gain the Retributive Strike champion’s reaction and the [[Lay on Hands]] devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:

* You must act with honor, never taking advantage of others, lying, or cheating. 
* You must respect the lawful authority of legitimate leadership wherever you go, and follow its laws.

## Champion's Reaction

### [[Retributive Strike]] <span class="action-icon">5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Champion</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Trigger** An enemy damages your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.

---
You protect your ally and strike your foe. The ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. If the foe is within reach, make a melee Strike against it.

## Divine Smite<span class="item-type">Level 9</span>

You surround evil targets in a punishing halo. If you hit with your Retributive Strike, the target takes [[Persistent Damage]] equal to your Charisma modifier.

## Exalt<span class="item-type">Level 11</span>

When you use Retributive Strike, each ally within 15 feet of you with the target in their melee reach can spend a reaction to Strike the target with a –5 penalty.
