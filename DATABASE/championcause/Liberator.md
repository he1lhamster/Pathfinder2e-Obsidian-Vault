# Liberator [Chaotic Good]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
You’re committed to defending the freedom of others. You gain the Liberating Step champion’s reaction and the [[DATABASE/spell/Lay on Hands|lay on hands]] devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:

* You must respect the choices others make over their own lives, and you can’t force someone to act in a particular way or threaten them if they don’t. 
* You must demand and fight for others’ freedom to make their own decisions. You may never engage in or countenance slavery or tyranny.

## Champion's Reaction

### [[DATABASE/action/Liberating Step|Liberating Step]] <span class="action-icon">5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Champion</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Trigger** An enemy damages, [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grabs]], or [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapples]] your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.

---
You free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbing]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restraining]], [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilizing]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzing]] them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn’t need to escape.

## Divine Smite<span class="item-type">Level 9</span>

You punish those who ensnare your allies in bondage. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to make your ally [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent good damage]] equal to your Charisma modifier.

## Exalt<span class="item-type">Level 11</span>

You can help your whole group get into position. When you use Liberating Step, if your ally doesn’t attempt to break free of an effect, you and all allies within 15 feet can Step, in addition to the triggering ally.
