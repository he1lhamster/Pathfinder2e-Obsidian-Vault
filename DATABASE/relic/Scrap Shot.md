**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate) ; **Effect** Magnetic repulsion sends a sharp chunk of metal scrap flying from your relic. Make a spell attack roll with your relic against a target within 30 feet. The chunk deals 1d6 piercing damage for every 2 levels the relic has (minimum 1d6). If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your spell attack roll, and the target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] until the start of your next turn as the scrap adheres to the target. If your relic is made of a precious metal, the shot is also made of or coated in that metal, bypassing resistances and the like accordingly. The scrap left behind by the shot rusts or crumbles quickly and isn't worth anything if sold.
