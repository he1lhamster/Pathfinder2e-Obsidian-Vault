Your relic awakens to sapience, developing a personality (usually one that clashes with your own). Your relic has an alignment corresponding to the type of fiend associated with the item, precise vision and imprecise hearing each out to 30 feet, the ability to understand and speak one language you know, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers of +0. Your item’s total Perception and Will modifiers are equal to your proficiency modifiers in Perception and Will, respectively. It is trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] associated with its fiend type (such as Demon Lore), for a total modifier of 2 + the relic’s level. Unlike most intelligent items, the relic has no actions or reactions and can’t use any of its own activations.
