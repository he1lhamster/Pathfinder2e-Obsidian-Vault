The heavens protect you from harm. While wearing the relic, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC against attacks by fiends and resistance to an energy type corresponding to the relic’s celestial origin (such as sonic resistance from a [[DATABASE/monster/Choral (Choir Angel)|choral angel]]). The resistance is equal to half the relic’s level (minimum 1).
