You grow scales that guard against draconic attacks. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC against attacks from dragons and resistance to an energy type corresponding to the soul seed's draconic origin (such as fire resistance from a [[Dragon, Red]]) equal to half the relic's level (minimum resistance 1).
