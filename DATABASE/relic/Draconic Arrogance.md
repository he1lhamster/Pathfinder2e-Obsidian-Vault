**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You're about to roll a saving throw; **Effect** You laugh at fate and revel in your draconic arrogance. If you roll a critical success on the saving throw, you can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the creature that created the effect that forced you to roll the saving throw (if any). If you roll a success, you critically succeed instead. If you roll a failure (but not a critical failure), you succeed instead. If you roll a critical failure, however, you're forced to face your own hubris and become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 2]].
