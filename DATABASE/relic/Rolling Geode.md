**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** Stone and crystal form a sphere that chases your foes. You create a geode in an unoccupied square within 30 feet. You can spend a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to move the geode up to 30 feet along the ground. If the geode enters a creature’s space, the creature must succeed at a basic Reflex save or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage; a creature can take damage this way only once per turn, even if you roll the geode through its space multiple times. The geode persists for up to 1 minute or until destroyed or Dismissed; it has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and is immune to critical hits and precision damage.
