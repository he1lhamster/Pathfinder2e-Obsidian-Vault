**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Effect An infusion of positive energy from your relic can temporarily animate an unliving object. You transform an adjacent inanimate object into an [[Animate Object]] with a level equal to one-half the relic’s level and appropriate to the object (so a broom would become an animated broom). The object pursues a single simple noncombat task you state when you use Bestow Life, ignoring any subsequent commands. The object is mindless and pursues the task single-mindedly and uncreatively. The object remains animated for 1 hour.
