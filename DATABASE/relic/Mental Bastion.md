Your relic takes over some of your mental processes and enhances others. You gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Telepathy|telepathy]]; if you already have telepathy, you instead increase its range by 30 feet. Whenever you would become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]], reduce the value by 1. You are permanently [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] and can use the additional action to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]].
