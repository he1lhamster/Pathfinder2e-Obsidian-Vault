Your relic takes over some of your mental processes and enhances others. You gain [[Telepathy]]; if you already have telepathy, you instead increase its range by 30 feet. Whenever you would become [[Stupefied]], reduce the value by 1. You are permanently [[Quickened]] and can use the additional action to [[Recall Knowledge]].
