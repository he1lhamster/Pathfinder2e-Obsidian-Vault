**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact ; **Effect** Your stare causes a creature’s flesh to rot and wither away. Target a creature you can see within 30 feet. Your stare deals 1d6 negative damage to the creature for every 2 levels the relic has (minimum 1d6; basic Fortitude save). An undead creature or other creature with negative healing targeted this way is instead healed 1d6 HP per level of the relic and is temporarily immune to this effect for 10 minutes.
