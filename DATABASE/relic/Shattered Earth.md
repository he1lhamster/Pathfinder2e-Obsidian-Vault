**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** Seismic pulses from your relic ripple through the nearby ground, shaking sharp fragments to the surface. A 10-foot-radius patch of stone or earth within 60 feet is transformed into difficult terrain. A creature that enters an affected square during a move action must succeed at an Acrobatics check or Reflex save or take 1d6 piercing damage; it needs to roll only once per move action even if it moves through several squares. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, increase the damage by 1d6.
