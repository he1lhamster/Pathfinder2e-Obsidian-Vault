Whenever you use the relic’s form of fury activation, it can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Aerial Form|aerial form]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Dinosaur Form|dinosaur form]] instead of [[DATABASE/spell/Animal Form|animal form]]. Like form of fury, these spells also turn you into the same type of animal each time (so you have three forms you can assume in total, one from each spell). The spell level is the same as defined in form of fury.
 While transformed, you can switch from one of the three forms to another by Sustaining the Activation. This doesn’t change the duration.
