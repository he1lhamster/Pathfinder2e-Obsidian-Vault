Water collects at the tip of your relic. You can adjust your grip on your relic with an Interact action to allow you to make lashing current weapon Strikes with your relic, which deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage; have the disarm, finesse, reach 10, trip, and versatile S traits; and are in the flail group. Your lashing current Strikes gain the benefit of your relic’s fundamental and property runes, though any property runes that would not be applicable to the lashing currents are not applied. You can use another Interact action to return to your normal grip and make Strikes with the relic.
