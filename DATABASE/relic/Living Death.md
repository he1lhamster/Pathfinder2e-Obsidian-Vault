You stand on the threshold between the living and the dead. If you attempt a saving throw against an effect that would deal negative damage to you, such as [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]], your outcome is one degree of success better than what you rolled. If you roll a critical success and the effect is capable of healing undead, you regain HP equal to half the spell’s full damage. Any positive spell or effect that would heal you has only half the normal effect. All these effects apply only if you are a living creature.
