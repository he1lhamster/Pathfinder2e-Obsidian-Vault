Your relic’s energies have given you control over the boundary between flesh and stone. You can cast 6th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Flesh to Stone|flesh to stone]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Stone to Flesh|stone to flesh]] as innate spells, each once per day. As long as you are standing on the earth, your body reflexively petrifies at the moment you are struck, granting you resistance 5 to physical damage (except adamantine). This increases to 8 in caves or subterranean environments.
