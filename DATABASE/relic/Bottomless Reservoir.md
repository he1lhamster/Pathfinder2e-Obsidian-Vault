**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** Your relic can absorb and release water, storing it in a endless reservoir. You either touch your relic to an adjacent body of water and absorb 1 gallon of it into the reservoir, or you release 1 gallon of a liquid from the reservoir. You can add another action to the activation to absorb water from a touched creature made entirely of water, like a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Water|water elemental]]. If you do, it takes 1d6 damage per relic level (basic Fortitude save).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Frequency** You are targeted by an acid or water effect; **Effect** Your relic attempts to counteract the effect, expending 1 gallon of stored liquid. At the GM’s discretion, you can use this ability on effects made of other liquids, such as blood.
