**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** An ally within 60 feet regains more Hit Points than it is currently down via a targeted positive healing effect without a duration; **Effect** Your relic acts as a relay for vitality. You or an adjacent willing creature regain a number of Hit Points equal to the amount in excess of the triggering creature’s maximum Hit Points; for instance, if the triggering creature was missing 5 Hit Points and was targeted by a [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] spell that restored 12 Hit Points, you or an adjacent willing creature would regain the remaining 7 Hit Points.
