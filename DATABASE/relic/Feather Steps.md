While wearing the relic, you do not trigger traps that use weight or pressure plates as a trigger. Also, whenever you fall, you reduce the falling damage by the level of the relic. If this would reduce the falling damage to 0, you land on your feet and are not prone. The relic grants a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks made to Jump, increasing to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 17th level.
