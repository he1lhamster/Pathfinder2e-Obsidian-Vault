Your relic's link to the [[Plane of Metal]] tunes it in to the inevitability of rust and decay. You can cast 5th-rank [[Rust Cloud]] at will as an innate spell.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (aura, concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Rusted flakes swirl in a cloud around you, creating a 15-foot emanation that lasts for 1 minute. You're [[Concealed]] to anyone outside the cloud. An enemy that starts its turn in the cloud takes 15 slashing damage with a basic Fortitude save. If the target has the metal trait or is primarily made of metal, the damage is 30 instead. Unattended non-magical metal items within the cloud automatically become broken.
