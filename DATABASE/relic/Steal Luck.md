**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; ; **Trigger** You or a creature within 30 feet of you rolls two d20s for a fortune or misfortune effect and you like the higher roll; **Effect** You steal the higher of the two numbers the triggering target rolled; the target must use the other result. Until you make your next daily preparations, you can substitute that number for one d20 roll made for a saving throw or skill check you have to make against an effect created by an enemy, hazard, or the environment. Doing so is a fortune effect. If you fail to do so before your next daily preparations, you lose the stored number.
