When you activate creative spark, you can choose to summon an [[DATABASE/monster/Air Wisp|air wisp]], a [[DATABASE/monster/Water Wisp|water wisp]], and an [[DATABASE/monster/Earth Wisp|earth wisp]] in unoccupied squares next to you, in addition to the fire wisp. Unlike a typical earth wisp, the summoned earth wisp takes the form of a small iron creature resembling an anvil crossed with a horned beetle. Like the fire wisp, these additional wisps don't act in combat but can assist you while you [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]] items. While all four wisps are assisting you, the bonus you gain from creative spark is doubled, and your outcome for [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] checks related to blacksmithing is one degree of success better than your roll. In addition, being assisted by all four wisps replaces the need for any equipment other than blacksmithing tools when crafting metal items. The wisps last for up to 10 minutes or until you Dismiss them all together as an action. If you extend the duration of the fire wisp, it also extends the duration for the other wisps.
