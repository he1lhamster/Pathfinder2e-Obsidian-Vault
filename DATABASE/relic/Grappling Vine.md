**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** Your relic launches a sticky, multi-stranded vine at a target within 50 feet. Make an attack roll as you would when using a [[DATABASE/equipment/Grappling Hook|grappling hook,]] but if you roll a critical failure on the check to secure the vine, you get a failure instead. Once the vine is anchored, creatures receive a +1 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]] the vine, and they gain a +5-foot status bonus to the distance they move with a successful check while Climbing using the vine.
 The vine lasts for 1 day or until you use Grappling Vine again, at which point your older vine withers.
