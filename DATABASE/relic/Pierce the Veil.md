The relic allows you to pierce the veil between life and death. While you are holding or wearing the relic, you have the negative healing ability (as though you were undead; positive energy harms you and negative energy heals you). In addition, whenever you are healed by a negative spell or effect, you gain resistance 5 to all damage (except force, [[Ghost Touch]], and positive) until the start of your next turn. Finally, you gain a +2 item bonus to all saves against death effects while you are the bearer of the relic; this increases to a +3 item bonus at 13th level.
