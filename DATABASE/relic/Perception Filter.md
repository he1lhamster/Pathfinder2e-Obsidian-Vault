**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Your relic reaches into the minds of nearby creatures and blocks your presence from their perceptions. For the next 10 minutes, a creature that enters a 120-foot-radius emanation, centered on you, must attempt a secret Will save, after which the creature is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes a –2 status penalty to Perception checks to [[Seek]] or otherwise detect you.
**Failure** You filter all of the creature’s senses, making it difficult for it to notice you. When you are [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]] from the creature, it doesn’t observe you as soon as you do anything other than [[Hide]], [[Sneak]], or Step. If it rolls a Perception check to Seek or otherwise detect you, it gets the outcome one degree of success worse than what it rolled, and if you roll a [[Stealth]] check to Hide, Sneak, or otherwise escape its attention, you get the outcome one degree of success better than what you rolled against the creature. If you use a hostile action toward the creature, the effect ends for that creature after your hostile action is completed.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the effect doesn’t end for that creature if you use a hostile action against it.
