**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Profane energies twist your weapons, filling them with rage toward everything good. For 1 minute, your weapons and unarmed attacks gain the [[DATABASE/equipment/Unholy|unholy]] weapon rune while you hold them. If a weapon is at its limit on property runes, you can choose one property rune on the weapon to go dormant while the _unholy_ rune takes effect. In addition, successful Strikes your allies make while they’re within 30 feet of you deal 1 additional evil damage.
