Your relic absorbs light and wraps shadow around you, hiding you in darkness. As long as you are in dim light in an area of shadows, you can attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]], even if you aren’t concealed against the creature, such as with a creature with darkvision.
