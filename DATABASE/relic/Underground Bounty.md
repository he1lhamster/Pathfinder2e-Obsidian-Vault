Your relic produces metals and stones to empower your weapons. Each day during your daily preparations, your relic conjures a magical shard of [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|silver]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]], gold, or a non-precious stone or metal material of your choice (such as bronze or granite). If your relic is a weapon, it immediately absorbs the shard, causing it to gain a magical sheen of that metal or stone until your next daily preparations. If your relic is not a weapon, the shard is not immediately used, and you can touch it to a stone or metal weapon using an Interact action to give it a magical sheen of that metal or stone for 10 minutes. While coated in the magical sheen, the weapon interacts with weaknesses, resistances, and the like as if it were made of the stone or metal from the shard rather than its own. The sheen and the shard are obviously magical in nature, and if you don’t use the shard, it disappears when you make your next daily preparations. At 17th level, add [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Weapon|adamantine]] and [[DATABASE/equipment/Mithral Weapon|mithral]] to the available options.
