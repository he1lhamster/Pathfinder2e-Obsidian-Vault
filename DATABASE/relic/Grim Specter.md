**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You can call upon the terrifying powers that fuel your relic to transform yourself into a specter of death. You become incorporeal, having no physical body. You are immune to effects that require a physical body, including precision damage as well as exposure to most diseases and poisons. You also have resistance to all damage equal to half the relic’s level; force damage, [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] attacks, negative damage, and positive damage ignore this resistance, and the resistance doubles against non-magical damage.
 You can move through solid objects. When inside an object, you can’t perceive, attack, or Interact with anything outside it, and you’re always [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] on turns you start in an object. Corporeal creatures can pass through you but can’t end their movement in your space. You can’t attempt Strength-based checks against corporeal creatures or objects, unless those objects have the _ghost touch_ property rune. Likewise, corporeal creatures can’t attempt Strength-based checks against you.
 You can Sustain the Activation up to 1 minute.
