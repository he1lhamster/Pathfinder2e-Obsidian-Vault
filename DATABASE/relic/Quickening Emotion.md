**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** You are the target of an emotion effect from a hostile source; **Effect** The relic attempts a counteract check. If the check succeeds, the relic absorbs the effect completely, negating it. Instead, you're [[Quickened]] for up to 1 minute, but no longer than the triggering effect's duration. You then become temporarily immune to this effect for 1 hour.
