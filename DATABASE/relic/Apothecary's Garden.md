Your relic grows potent natural medicines. Each night, two medicinal herbs (or other plants) grow from your relic and can be harmlessly harvested during your next daily preparations. A living creature that consumes an herb with an Interact action regains 1d8 Hit Points for every 2 relic levels (minimum 1d8). At 9th level, the relic grows three herbs each night, and at 17th level, the relic grows four herbs each night. Herbs wither away 1 day after being harvested.
