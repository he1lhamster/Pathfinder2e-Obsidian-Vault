Your relic is engraved with nodes and elements only visible from up close, lacking only a source of current for its machinations. You gain resistance to electricity equal to half the level of your relic (minimum 1).
**Activate****—Complete the Circuit** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (manipulate); **Trigger** You are targeted by or are in the area of an electricity effect; **Effect** Your relic uses the triggering effect to complete its circuit. You choose which path the electricity takes down the circuit, gaining the corresponding benefit.

* **Capacitor** You become electrically charged, gaining a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls until the end of your next turn.
* **Inductor** Your resistance against electricity damage increases to the level of your relic until the end of your next turn.
* **Resistor** Your relic attempts to counteract the effect. On a failure, your relic overheats, dealing fire damage to you equal to the counteract rank of the effect (or double the counteract rank on a critical failure).
