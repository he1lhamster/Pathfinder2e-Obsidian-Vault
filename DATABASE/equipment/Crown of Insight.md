A series of evenly spaced, unblinking tattooed eyes line your skin. When you enter an area that contains creatures within 60 feet that are unnoticed to you, the GM rolls a secret Perception check for you against the creatures' [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] DCs. On a success, the creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] by you, rather than [[DATABASE/condition/Unnoticed|unnoticed]], and on a critical success, the creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to you. All creatures in the area are then temporarily immune to your _crown of insight_ for 24 hours. The _crown of insight_ doesn't help you find hidden items or traps, nor can it help you discern a creature hiding in plain sight, such as a [[DATABASE/monster/Gargoyle|gargoyle]] pretending to be an inanimate statue. Additionally, since the effect occurs when you move to enter an area that contains creatures, it doesn't detect an unnoticed creature [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneaking]] up on you.
