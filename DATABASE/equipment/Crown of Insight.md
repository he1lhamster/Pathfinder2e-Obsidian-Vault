A series of evenly spaced, unblinking tattooed eyes line your skin. When you enter an area that contains creatures within 60 feet that are unnoticed to you, the GM rolls a secret Perception check for you against the creatures' [[Stealth]] DCs. On a success, the creature becomes [[Undetected]] by you, rather than [[Unnoticed]], and on a critical success, the creature becomes [[Hidden]] to you. All creatures in the area are then temporarily immune to your _crown of insight_ for 24 hours. The _crown of insight_ doesn't help you find hidden items or traps, nor can it help you discern a creature hiding in plain sight, such as a [[Gargoyle]] pretending to be an inanimate statue. Additionally, since the effect occurs when you move to enter an area that contains creatures, it doesn't detect an unnoticed creature [[Sneak]] up on you.
