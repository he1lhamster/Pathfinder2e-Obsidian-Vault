This _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Armor|adamantine]] [[DATABASE/armor/Scale Mail|scale mail]]_ appears to have a [[DATABASE/equipment/Fortification|fortification]] rune but grants none of its effects. Whenever you are critically hit, after taking damage, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]] for 1 round. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the armor fuses to you.
