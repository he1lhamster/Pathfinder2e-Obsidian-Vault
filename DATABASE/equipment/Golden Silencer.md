The Golden Gunners are dreaded for their use of their _golden silencers_, which they put to good use in clandestine raids. They silence both the loud gunshot and the screams of creatures wounded by its shot. A weapon with a _golden silencer_ attached emits no light and makes no noise when fired. A target hit by a ranged Strike from the affixed weapon must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be silenced as well until the start of its next turn. A silenced creature can't call for help or use sonic abilities, nor can it use abilities with the auditory trait. This prevents it from casting spells that include verbal components.

The save DC is 27, and the silence effect on the target creature lasts for up to 1 minute. The silenced creature can attempt a new Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns to end the duration early.
