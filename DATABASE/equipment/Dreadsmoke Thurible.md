This black-and-gray thurible is decorated with a skeleton motif; the jaw of one of the decorative skulls unhinges, allowing you to load it with incense as an action. A long, thin chain is connected to the top of the thurible.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Cost** incense worth at least 5 gp; **Effect** You swing the thurible around you, spreading inky black smoke in a 20-foot emanation that has the effect of _[[DATABASE/spell/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]]_. Undead creatures can see through the smoke as if it didn’t exist. Negative energy also disrupts the magic of the smoke; anyone who uses a negative effect, along with creatures affected by a negative effect, can see through the smoke for 1 round.
