You need thieves' tools to [[DATABASE/action/Pick a Lock|Pick Locks]] or [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disable Devices]] (of some types) using the [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] skill. If your thieves' tools are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your tools; this doesn't require using the [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repair]] action. If you wear your thieves' tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them. 
You can use a set of tools with 1 hand if you're wearing them or 2 if you're holding them.

Smaller and made of stronger materials than most sets of thieves' tools, the items in this kit are much easier to conceal. You gain a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Conceal an Object|Conceal]] these tools. They otherwise function as infiltrator thieves' tools.
