Named because of its popularity among thieves to distract any authorities in pursuit, a captivating rosebud has a near-irresistible fragrance.
**Activate****—Scent of Roses** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate, mental, olfactory); **Effect** You throw the _captivating rosebud_ in a square adjacent to you. The rosebud quickly sprouts into a little rosebush that lasts for 1 hour. Any creature that passes within 15 feet of the rose bush, other than yourself, must attempt a DC 18 Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes a –1 status penalty to Perception checks for 10 minutes.
**Failure** As success, but a –2 penalty.
**Critical Failure** As success, but a –2 penalty and the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] by the rosebush.
**Activate****—Rose Vines** 10 minutes (manipulate); **Effect** You plant the _captivating rosebud_ into a square adjacent to a building or other structure. It grows into a rosebush that stretches up to 30 feet tall. You and your allies can use the rosebush as a ladder to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]] easily up and down the side of the adjacent structure, but all other creatures must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or fail to notice the rosebush's presence.
