Copper rings spiral around this [[DATABASE/shield/Steel Shield|steel shield]]. Twin electrical probes near the grip can socket into a jar of moderate (or higher leveled) [[DATABASE/equipment/Bottled Lightning|bottled lightning]], which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded magnetic shield can be activated to convert it into an electromagnet. When an activated magnetic shield is raised, the circumstance bonus increases by 1 against attacks made with weapons primarily made of metal. If you use a [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] against a creature attacking you with such a weapon, you also gain a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] attempts against that weapon until the end of your next turn. The shield remains charged for 3 rounds, consuming the bottled lightning, and once the reaction has begun it can't be deactivated.
