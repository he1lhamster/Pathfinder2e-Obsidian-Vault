Sure-step crampons are sturdy leather boots with warm fur lining and magically augmented steel crampons that offer the wearer better purchase on ice. They allow you to walk across ice without difficulty, ignoring the uneven ground and difficult terrain caused by ice, and reducing greater difficult terrain caused by ice to difficult terrain.
