Light refracts in strange ways through these precisely ground glass tiles, lengthening the refracted force and causing it to push back. Adding this catalyst to a [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Force|wall of force]] spell increases the wall's maximum length to 80 feet and maximum height to 40 feet and causes creatures that try to move into the wall's space (or are [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shoved]] into the wall) to take 2d6 force damage.
