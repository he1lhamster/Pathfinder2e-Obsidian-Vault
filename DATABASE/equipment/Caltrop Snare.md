This snare consists of a hidden canister of [[DATABASE/equipment/Caltrops|caltrops]] attached to a trip wire. When the snare is triggered, it flings the caltrops into either the snare’s square or a square adjacent to the snare. You choose which square when you set up the snare.
 If the caltrops scatter into the same square as a creature, that creature must attempt the Acrobatics check immediately.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a container of caltrops.
