_The Desert_ signifies enduring passage through trying circumstances. As long as _The Desert_ is invested, you are immune to the effects of temperatures ranging from extreme cold to extreme heat, and can hold your breath and go without food and water for twice as long as normal.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You wave the card in the air to create desert winds that blast sand so scouring it strips flesh from bone. The sand created by this effect vanishes an instant later, but the effects on those caught in the area linger. Creatures in a 60-foot cone take 7d6 piercing damage and 7d6 fire damage (with a basic Fortitude save equal to your class DC). A creature who fails this save also becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]] for 1 minute, and a creature who critically fails this save becomes enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and fatigued until they get a night's rest (or the fatigue is removed by other means). The damage increases to 8d6 piercing and 8d6 fire if you're at least 15th level, to 9d6 piercing and 9d6 fire if you're at least 17th level, and to 10d6 piercing and 10d6 fire if you're at least 19th level.
