This sprig of berry-festooned holly and mistletoe doesn't wilt or rot. It can be used as a primal focus, and it also grants the creature holding it a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Effect** You squeeze juice from one of the berries and smear it onto a [[DATABASE/weapon/Club|club]] or [[DATABASE/weapon/Staff|staff]] to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Shillelagh|shillelagh]] upon it.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You can twine the sprig around the wrist of one hand and touch a tree to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Tree Shape|tree shape]] upon yourself, except instead of a becoming a tree, you become a vine on the touched tree.

**Price** 3,900 gp
The sprig grants a +2 bonus and can be activated in one additional way:
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You plant the _greater primeval mistletoe_ into an area of natural earth or stone. Once planted, the plant immediately sprouts into an area of holly bushes that don't impede movement and that pulse with positive energy, replicating the effects of a [[DATABASE/spell/Field of Life|field of life]] spell. This lasts for up to 1 minute, as long as you continue to Sustain the Activation. When this magic ends, the holly bushes revert back into the original _greater primeval mistletoe_.
