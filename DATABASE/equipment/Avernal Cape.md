It functions as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Dueling Cape|dueling cape]] and while moved into a protective position, it also grants you fire resistance equal to twice the relic's number of gifts.
 **Forming the Bond** While wearing the cape, you defeat a foe and spare their life.
 **Advancing the Bond** Befriend beasts and terrify foes with your physical presence and prowess.
 **Minor Gifts** [[DATABASE/relic/Feral Claws|feral claws]], [[DATABASE/relic/Flare Bolt|flare bolt]], [[DATABASE/relic/Heat Haze|heat haze]]
