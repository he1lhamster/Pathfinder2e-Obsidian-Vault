Blister ammunition is loaded with alchemically processed irritants, such as pollen, pepper, and formic acid. A creature hit by activated blister ammunition must attempt a Fortitude save or begin to itch uncontrollably in addition to damage the attack normally deals. On a critical hit, increase the Fortitude DC by 2, and the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round. For the duration, each time the target attempts a concentrate action, it must attempt a DC 8 flat check, losing the action on a failure. An affected creature can use a single Interact action to scratch and sneeze, allowing it to automatically pass the flat check. The effect ends early once an affected creature spends 3 Interact actions scratching and sneezing. These Interact actions don't need to be consecutive.
