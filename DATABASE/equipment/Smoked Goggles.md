These goggles use lenses made out of smoked glass to protect against creatures with gaze attacks. While wearing smoked goggles, you're always considered to be [[DATABASE/action/Avert Gaze|Averting your Gaze]], but all creatures have [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealment]] from you. The fact that the goggles conceal creatures is part of what grants the wearer the item's benefits. If you have a way to negate the concealment from the smoked goggles, you no longer gain the benefit, either.
