A _conducting_ weapon can channel energy through it. The weapon gains the resonant weapon trait, except that when you [[DATABASE/action/Conduct Energy|Conduct Energy]], the weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage of the selected type instead of 1 additional damage per die; if the weapon already had the resonant weapon trait, it deals 1d8 damage plus 1 damage per die instead. On a critical hit, the weapon deals 1d8 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]] of the same type.
