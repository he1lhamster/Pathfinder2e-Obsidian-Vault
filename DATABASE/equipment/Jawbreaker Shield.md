This heavy bone shield is composed of a massive plate of dinosaur bone with jagged, tooth-like ridges ringing its edge. It has Hardness 12, HP 48, and BT 24. The ridges are unremovable _+1 striking [[Shield Spikes]]_ that deal slashing damage instead of piercing damage. While holding the _jawbreaker shield_, you gain a +3 item bonus to your Reflex DC to resist [[Swallow Whole]] attacks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Trigger** A creature attacks you with a jaws or fangs Strike or similar Strike using its mouth; **Effect** You make a shield bash Strike as a reaction against the attacker. If the shield bash hits, the target takes damage and must attempt a DC 31 Fortitude saving throw. The effects of the saving throw are determined after the effects of the triggering Strike are resolved.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** You wound the target’s mouth. It takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]] and takes a –2 status penalty to attack and damage rolls with jaws, fangs, or similar Strikes for 24 hours.
**Critical Failure** You break the target’s jaw. As failure, and the creature can't make Strikes using its mouth for 1 minute. At the end of its turn, it can attempt a Fortitude save to regain the ability to make Strikes using its mouth.
