You can unfold this virtuoso percussion instrument into a hand drum (1 Bulk), a marching drum set with a shoulder harness and back brace (3 Bulk), or a large standing drum set with a built-in stool (16 Bulk). Changing the folding drum's size is a 3-action Interact activity, and the drums must have sufficient open space to accommodate their new size.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact (concentrate) **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You play a pounding rhythm on the drum. If the next action you use is to cast a composition cantrip that has an emanation, increase the area of the emanation by 30 feet.
