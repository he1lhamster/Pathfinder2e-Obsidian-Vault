_The Demon's Lantern_ represents trickery and feats of legerdemain. As long as you have _The Demon's Lantern_ invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]], [[DATABASE/action/Palm an Object|Palm an Object]], or [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** A creature hits you with a melee attack; **Effect** You release a flash of lights and attempt a Reflex saving throw. If your saving throw is higher than the attack roll for the triggering attack, it misses. If the attack misses, the attacker is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the end of your next turn.
