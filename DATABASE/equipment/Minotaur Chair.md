A _minotaur chair_ is a [[Traveler's Chair]] with [[Chair Storage]], [[Impulse Control]], and _+1 [[Striking]] [[Wounding]] [[Wheel Spikes]]_. The _wheel spikes_ can have runes upgraded, transferred, or added as normal. The chair magically stores the kinetic energy from movement throughout the day, allowing you to expend it to make a powerful rushing charge.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You rush forward with the wheelchair in a powerful charge, bowling through foes who stand in the way. Stride in a straight line, moving through enemies' spaces and making an attack with the wheel spikes against every foe in the line. If the foe is [[Prone]], the following effects apply: the attack gains a +1 circumstance bonus to damage per weapon damage die, and the _wounding_ rune deals 1d12 [[Persistent Damage]] on a hit (or 3d6 persistent bleed damage on a critical hit).
