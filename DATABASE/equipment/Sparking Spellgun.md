A broad wooden tube with a handle, a _sparking spellgun_ radiates warmth. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun fires a small ball of sparks and fire, then crumbles to ash. The ball explodes in a flash when it hits, dealing fire damage and [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]] according to its type.
**Critical Success** The target takes double damage, takes double persistent damage, is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round, and is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] while the persistent damage lasts.
**Success** The target takes full damage, full persistent damage, and is dazzled while the persistent damage lasts.
