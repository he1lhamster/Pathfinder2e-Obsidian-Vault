The weapon can harm creatures without physical form. A _ghost touch_ weapon is particularly effective against incorporeal creatures, which almost always have a specific vulnerability to _ghost touch_ weapons. Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield _ghost touch_ weapons (unlike most physical objects).
