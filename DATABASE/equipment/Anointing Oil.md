Carried by many Knights of Lastwall, this amber-colored, fragrant-smelling oil is meant to prevent those who fall in battle from rising as undead. Applying anointing oil to a corpse casts [[DATABASE/spell/Gentle Repose|gentle repose]] on it. The effects last for 24 hours. The oil is repugnant to the undead. An undead creature that touches a corpse treated with this oil is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] until the contact is broken or the oil's effect wears off.
