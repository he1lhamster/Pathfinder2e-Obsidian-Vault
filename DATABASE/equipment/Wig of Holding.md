_Wigs of holding_ are created from planar fibers and contain small extradimensional spaces accessible within the hair. They can hold up to four items of light Bulk inside them, and Bulk held within the _wig of holding_ doesn't increase the Bulk of the wig itself. You can Interact with a _wig of holding_ to put items inside or remove items from it, and you can do so more easily than with a mundane container. It only takes a single Interact action to withdraw these items, like a worn item, rather than taking two Interact actions, like a stowed item.
