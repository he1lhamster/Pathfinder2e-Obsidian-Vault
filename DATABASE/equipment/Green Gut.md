This watery, mint-green emetic of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Xulgath|xulgath]] design is often carried in a delicate obsidian vial or other fragile container. In the unfortunate circumstance that a creature has been [[DATABASE/monsterability/Swallow Whole|Swallowed Whole]] by another creature, the swallowed creature can break open a vial of greengut to immediately induce vomiting. The swallower must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or take 18d6 poison damage and possibly vomit the contents of its stomach.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage, is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]], and vomits up any and all creatures Swallowed Whole on its next turn (a single action, which also allows it a Fortitude save against the sickened condition), as well as any stones or other objects it swallowed.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage and is sickened 2.
