Crafted from flawless jade, the guard of this [[DATABASE/weapon/Rapier|rapier]] takes the form of a twisting serpent with the blade thrusting from its open mouth. This rapier functions as a _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Speed|speed]] rapier_. While wielding the rapier, your movement doesn't trigger reactions when you Stride, [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]], or [[DATABASE/action/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]]. When you invest the rapier, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You fail, but don't critically fail, an attack using the _viper rapier_; **Effect** The tip of the rapier briefly takes the form of a viper's head, and the blade twists and contorts, biting the target you missed. The target is affected as if successfully poisoned with [[DATABASE/equipment/Purple Worm Venom|purple worm venom]] (DC 43).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** A creature misses or critically misses you with an attack; **Effect** With a slight, obviously mocking bow or curtsy, you Step.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You twirl your rapier in a serpentine pattern, causing your form to become a blur of motion. You're [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] for 1 minute or until you take a hostile action. While you're concealed, you also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws.
