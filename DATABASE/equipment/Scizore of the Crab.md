A _scizore of the crab_ is a _+1 [[DATABASE/weapon/Scizore|scizore]]_ that has the grapple trait in addition to its normal weapon traits.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike with this weapon, or you have a creature [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] with this weapon; **Effect** The target is grabbed until the end of your next turn. A grabbed creature can use the [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] action to get out of the Grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creature if you move away from it. This functions as the [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grab]] creature ability.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per round; **Requirements** You have a creature [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] with this weapon; **Effect** The crab claw animates and pinches open and shut, dealing slashing damage equal to the _scizore of the crab's_ number of damage dice.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include a claw from a [[DATABASE/monster/Giant Crab|giant crab]] or similar creature.
