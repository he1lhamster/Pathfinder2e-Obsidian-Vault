All _herd masks_ are linked to at least one other _herd mask_ and are usually sold in sets of multiple masks. Linked _herd masks_ look like one another, with only the slightest of differences to tell them apart.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You swap locations with another creature wearing a linked _herd mask_ within 100 feet. If you and the creature you swapped with are disguised as each other, other creatures gain an immediate Perception check against the lower of your or the other wearer's [[Deception]] DCs to [[Impersonate]] each other. On a failure, they don't realize the swap occurred.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Dimension Door]]. You can link a _herd mask_ you create to another _herd mask_ in your possession when you finish crafting it, which causes it to be linked to the chosen mask as well as all other _herd masks_ that are also linked to the chosen mask.
