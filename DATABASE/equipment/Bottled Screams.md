The vengeful wails of a [[DATABASE/monster/Revenant|revenant]], barely contained in this rattling jar, infuse your magic with all of their spite and malice. If a target fails its saving throw against your [[DATABASE/spell/Seal Fate|seal fate]] spell after you've added this catalyst, it takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]] of the type chosen for the spell (2d6 if it critically fails).
