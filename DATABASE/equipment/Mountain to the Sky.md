This tiny, carved walnut shell contains a sacred mountain within. You can only activate _mountain to the sky_ on an unoccupied patch of earth or soil. When activated, the walnut transforms into an impossibly steep mountain, 5,000 feet tall and 100 feet wide at the base. Climbing the mountain requires 8 hours and a successful DC 35 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check. After activating it, if you climb to the top of the mountain without any assistance from flight or magic, the mountain [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|plane shifts]] you to [[DATABASE/plane/Heaven|Heaven]] when you reach the summit. You can return the _mountain to the sky_ into the shape of a walnut shell as a 1-minute activity, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, so long as no living creatures are present on the mountain.
