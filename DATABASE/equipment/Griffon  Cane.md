A griffon cane is named for the shape of its base, which features four small pronged supports splayed out in a manner similar to a griffon's talons. A griffon cane's splayed foot enables it to stand upright by itself. A griffon cane deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, has the backswing and two-hand d10 traits, and is a martial melee weapon in the [[Dart]] weapon group.
