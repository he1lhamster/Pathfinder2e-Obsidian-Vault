These curving, delicate designs resemble leaves, vines, or creepers, most often wrapped around a limb, ear, or throat, or curled around specific muscles. They help you blend in among plants. You gain a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks, which increases to +2 in forests.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** A creature would detect you by [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seeking]]; **Requirements** You're in a forest or similar natural area; **Effect** The tattoo casts [[DATABASE/spell/Tree Shape|tree shape]] on you before you can be noticed. The duration of this spell is 10 minutes.
 If you've already Activated the tattoo, you can supply a separate casting of _tree shape_ to recharge the tattoo instead of having the spell's normal effect. This allows you to Activate the tattoo again in the same day. You can do so multiple times each day, but only as many times as you continue to cast _tree shape_ to recharge the tattoo after each use.
