This prosthetic eye resembles that of a bird of prey. Along with the abilities of the [[DATABASE/equipment/Magical Prosthetic Eye|magical prosthetic eye]], it allows you to strike foes at greater range and with impressive accuracy.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You become keenly aware of your foes, even those seemingly out of reach. For 1 minute, you can close your eyes as a free action to see through a ranged weapon you're wielding, which reduces the penalty for firing into your weapon's second range increment from –2 to 0. This effect doesn't negate the [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] condition.
