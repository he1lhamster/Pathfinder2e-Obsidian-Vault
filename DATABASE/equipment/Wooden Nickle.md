This rough wooden coin hangs from a string drilled through a hole at its center. When you Activate the _wooden nickel_, for 10 minutes, you can cause any object you touch of 2 Bulk or less to look, feel, and smell like valuables of a similar size crafted from a precious metal of your choice.
 A creature that touches or Interacts with an affected object can attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC to disbelieve the illusion, and a successful check against your Deception DC with [[Crafting]] or an appropriate [[Lore]] skill will also reveal the item's true nature. After 10 minutes have elapsed since you Activated the _wooden nickel_, all affected objects revert to their true form.
