This black strand of leather is tied to look like a peace knot when the weapon is worn, but it doesn't hamper drawing the weapon. When you activate the knot, the creature you damaged takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]].
 If you have the [[Twist the Knife]] feat, the talisman instead deals persistent bleed damage equal to your sneak attack damage.
