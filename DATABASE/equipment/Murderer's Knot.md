This black strand of leather is tied to look like a peace knot when the weapon is worn, but it doesn't hamper drawing the weapon. When you activate the knot, the creature you damaged takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]].
 If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Twist the Knife|Twist the Knife]] feat, the talisman instead deals persistent bleed damage equal to your sneak attack damage.
