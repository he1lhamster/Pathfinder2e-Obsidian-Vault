Focus briefly calms your neurons, helping ease mental effects. When you drink this elixir, the elixir attempts a counteract check with the listed counteract modifier to remove the [[Confused]] or [[Stupefied]] condition from a single source, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC.
