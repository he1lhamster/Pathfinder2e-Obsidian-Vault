Focus briefly calms your neurons, helping ease mental effects. When you drink this elixir, the elixir attempts a counteract check with the listed counteract modifier to remove the [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] condition from a single source, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC.
