A _hell staff_ is a tall, pointed staff forged of red-tinted steel with [[DATABASE/language/Infernal|Infernal]] inscriptions that march neatly down its sides. At its top sits an inverted ruby pyramid divided into nine sections. Found mostly in Cheliax or other lands where [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|diabolic]] influences hold sway, when used as a weapon the staff is a _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Axiomatic|axiomatic]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Unholy|unholy]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Staff|staff]]_. When you prepare this staff, if you're chaotic or good, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] until your next daily preparations.
 The staff's [[DATABASE/spell/Summon Lesser Servitor|summon lesser servitor]] spell can be used only to summon animals with the fiend trait, devils, or [[DATABASE/monster/Hell Hound|hell hounds]] (at 4th level). Its [[DATABASE/spell/Summon Fiend|summon fiend]] spell can summon only devils or hell hounds. 
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
