A _hell staff_ is a tall, pointed staff forged of red-tinted steel with [[Infernal]] inscriptions that march neatly down its sides. At its top sits an inverted ruby pyramid divided into nine sections. Found mostly in Cheliax or other lands where [[Devil]] influences hold sway, when used as a weapon the staff is a _+3 [[Striking]] [[Axiomatic]] [[Unholy]] [[Staff]]_. When you prepare this staff, if you're chaotic or good, you become [[Drained]] until your next daily preparations.
 The staff's [[Summon Lesser Servitor]] spell can be used only to summon animals with the fiend trait, devils, or [[Hell Hound]] (at 4th level). Its [[Summon Fiend]] spell can summon only devils or hell hounds. 
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.

* **1st** [[Protection]], _summon lesser servitor_
* **2nd** _summon lesser servitor_, [[Undetectable Alignment]]

* **5th** [[Flame Strike]], _summon fiend_
* **6th** [[Devil Form]], _summon fiend_
* **7th** [[Divine Decree]] (evil or lawful only), _summon fiend_
