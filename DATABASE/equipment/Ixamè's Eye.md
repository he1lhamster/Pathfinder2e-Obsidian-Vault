Via some strange alchemical reaction with the gasses of Terwa Lake, the [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Cloud|cloud dragon]] Ixamè's eyeballs have shriveled into sky-blue gems. The dragon's sense of vision isn't impaired, and her eyes can't be removed from her head until she's destroyed. Once removed, each gem functions as a special talisman. _Ixamè's eye_ sparkles when it's in an area of fog or mist. Activating the talisman enables you to see clearly through fog and mist for 1 minute; any creature [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] only by fog or mist is no longer concealed to you. If such a creature was relying on the concealment to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] or [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]], this also means it's no longer [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]].
