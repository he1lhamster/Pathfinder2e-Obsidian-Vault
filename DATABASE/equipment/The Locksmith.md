_The Locksmith_ represents opening locks, including metaphorical locks such as unlocking fate. As long as you have _The Locksmith_ invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Pick a Lock|Pick a Lock]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.

You attempt to counteract the triggering affliction, using half your level (rounded up) as the counteract level and a counteract check modifier equal to your class DC – 10.
