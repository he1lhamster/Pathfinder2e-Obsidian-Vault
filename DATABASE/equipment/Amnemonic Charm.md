This ornate locket, usually containing a faceless, humanoid portrait, is typically worn on a chain around the neck or attached to your clothing. When activated, the charm casts a DC 26 [[DATABASE/spell/Modify Memory|modify memory]] spell against a single target of the check, removing all memory of your failed attempt and potentially allowing you to make another attempt. The effect can't remove more than 3 minutes of memories from its target.
