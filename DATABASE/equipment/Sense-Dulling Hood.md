Sometimes, an enemy's dangerous special ability makes relatively standard sensory capabilities a liability. From [[DATABASE/monster/Otyugh|otyugh]] stench to a [[DATABASE/monster/Harpy|harpy's]] song, plenty of creatures use their prey's senses against them. A sense-dulling hood is a wide, single-use mask designed to be pulled from an airtight package and slipped over the head. The mask grants you an item bonus to saving throws against auditory, olfactory, and visual effects for a time, according to the mask's type. Since it dulls your senses without depriving you of them, the mask also imposes a –1 penalty to rolls and checks using Perception for the same duration.
