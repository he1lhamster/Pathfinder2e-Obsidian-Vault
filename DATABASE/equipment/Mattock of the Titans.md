This 15-foot-long [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Weapon|adamantine]] digging tool is far too big for even a Large creature to wield, though if you’re a Small or larger creature, you can wield it while wearing a [[DATABASE/equipment/Belt of Giant Strength|belt of giant strength]], as though it were appropriately sized for you and had 2 Bulk. The GM might also allow you to wield the mattock if you have some other means of wielding oversized weapons, such as if you’re a Large barbarian with the [[DATABASE/barbarianinstinct/Giant Instinct|giant instinct]] or are a Huge creature. When it’s used as a weapon, the _mattock of the titans_ has the statistics of a _+3 greater striking [[DATABASE/equipment/Keen|keen]] adamantine [[DATABASE/weapon/Greatpick|greatpick]]_.
