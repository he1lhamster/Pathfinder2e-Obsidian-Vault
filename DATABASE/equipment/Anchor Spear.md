**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 155. Lord of the Black Sands|Pathfinder #155: Lord of the Black Sands]]
**Price** 2,800 gp
**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

The tip of this _+2 greater striking [[DATABASE/weapon/Spear|spear]]_ is large and wickedly barbed, and the haft is inlaid with fine silver lines that run the length of the weapon. Wielded by specially trained [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Xulgath|xulgath]] cavalry, _anchor spears_ are used to prevent the escape of gogiteths or other monsters capable of climbing or burrowing.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command ; **Effect** The _anchor spear_ extends into a _+2 greater striking [[DATABASE/weapon/Longspear|longspear]]_ or back to its original form as a _+2 greater striking spear_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Trigger** You damage a creature using the _anchor spear_; **Effect** The spear embeds itself into the creature, and the spear's haft splits along the silver lines to become a series of hooks attached to a thin but strong cable. As long as the _anchor spear_ remains embedded in the creature, any time the creature burrows or climbs, it treats normal terrain as difficult terrain and difficult terrain as greater difficult terrain. The creature can spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 32 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to remove the spearhead.
**Critical Success** The _anchor spear_ is removed, becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], and falls to the ground in the creature's space.
**Success** The _anchor spear_ is removed, the creature takes 1d8 piercing damage, and the spear falls to the ground in a random space adjacent to the creature.
**Failure** The _anchor spear_ remains in place, and the creature takes 1d8 piercing damage.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature takes 2d8 piercing damage.
