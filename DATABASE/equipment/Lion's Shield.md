This [[DATABASE/shield/Steel Shield|steel shield]] (Hardness 6, HP 36, BT 18) is forged into the shape of a roaring lion’s head. The lion’s head functions as _+1 striking [[DATABASE/weapon/Shield Boss|shield boss]]_ that can’t be removed from the shield.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Raise a Shield **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You animate the lion’s head. You [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raise the Shield]] and make a melee Strike with it as part of the same action. The shield’s biting maw is a martial melee weapon that deals 2d6 piercing damage and has the deadly 1d6 trait; it can’t be enhanced by runes. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, during which time you can Strike with it each time you Raise the Shield, as well as with a Strike action.
