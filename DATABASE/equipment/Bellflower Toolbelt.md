Different versions of the _bellflower toolbelt_ are customized to appear to suit specific trades, so a belt used for carpentry would look different from a belt for baking.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact ; **Effect** You place an object of up to 1 Bulk into the belt, transforming that object into a tool befitting the trade for which the belt was created. Each object remains transformed until it has been removed from the belt for 24 hours or someone uses a single Interact action to return it to its normal form. If enough transformed items are in it, the belt can be used as [[DATABASE/equipment/Artisan's Tools|artisan's tools]] for that trade.
