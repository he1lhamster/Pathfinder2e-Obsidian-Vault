Copper cables run from these thick leather gloves to nodes that attach to the wearer's temples, allowing a spellcaster to convert the magic they normally cast to pure psychic intention. When you Cast a Spell using the _telekinetic converters_, you substitute any verbal spellcasting components for mental components of simple thought, granting the concentrate trait to the spell you're casting.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Prerequisite** You have a spellcasting class feature and you can cast cantrips; **Effect** You cast [[Telekinetic Projectile]] as an occult cantrip, heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Prerequisite** You have a spellcasting class feature and have an unexpended spell slot of 5th level or higher; **Effect** You cast your choice of [[Telekinetic Haul]] or [[Telekinetic Maneuver]] as a 5th-level occult spell, consuming one of your unexpended spell slots of the same level as if you had used it to cast the spell.
