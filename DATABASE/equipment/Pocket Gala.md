This item appears to be a miniature stone replica of an aristocratic home or a simple castle.
**Activate** (10 minutes) command, envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You place the figurine on the ground, and a harmonious note rings out as it grows into a spacious, elegant ballroom. The ballroom is 60 feet long, 45 feet wide, and features a ceiling that rises to a height of 20 feet. Elegant double doors on either end of the ballroom allow entry.
 Inside, the ballroom is fully stocked with tables and chairs along both sides. A feasting table in the center of each seating area provides enough food and drink for up to 36 guests, and a cadre of [[DATABASE/spell/Unseen Servant|unseen servants]] tend to guests' basic needs.
 While inside, you can utter a command word to call forth music, which echoes through the ballroom. Repeating the command word can alter the dynamics of the music, such as the musical style or tempo, or stop the music entirely. A second command word produces a set of masked, illusory dancers that immediately take to the floor and begin dancing to the current music. When there's no music, the illusory guests chatter among themselves in a nonsense language. An illusory dancer will gladly dance with anyone who asks. Repeating the command word dismisses the dancers.
 You can utter a third command word declaring the gala over to revert the ballroom to its original form. As it reverts, the illusory dancers clap and cheer for your hospitality. If you don't revert the ballroom on your own, it automatically returns to its original state at the next sunrise.
