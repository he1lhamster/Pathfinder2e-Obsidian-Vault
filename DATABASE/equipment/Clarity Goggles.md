_Clarity goggles_ feature faceted lenses that filter your surroundings from several slightly different angles at once, giving you a sharper picture of them. While wearing the goggles, you gain a +1 item bonus to visual Perception checks.

You must be able to see the illusion, and it must be within 60 feet. If the check succeeds, you see through the illusion for 10 minutes.
