This spiky, stony fragment shed from Ugly Cute's carapace fits quite comfortably over the hand. Though a little bulkier than the typical gauntlet, it still functions as a _+1 [[DATABASE/weapon/Spiked Gauntlet|spiked gauntlet]]_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You draw upon Ugly Cute's latent spiritual energy to infuse the gauntlet with forceful power. For 1 minute, Ugly Cute's gift gains the advantages of a [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] property rune and deals an additional 2 force damage on a successful Strike.
