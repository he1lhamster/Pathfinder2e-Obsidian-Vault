Made of [[Djezet]], [[Orichalcum]], and luminous, resonant crystal, a _witchwyrd beacon_ looks like a series of concentric rings mounted on rods that allow the rings to rotate independently of each other. These potent items are used by the Pactmasters of Katapesh to facilitate swift travel and are only rarely entrusted to others.
**Activate** 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact) ; **Effect** By touching the _witchwyrd beacon_ and focusing on it for 10 minutes, you attune yourself to it. Up to four creatures can be attuned to a single _witchwyrd beacon_ at any one time—to attune another creature, one of the previous four must become unattuned. You can break your attunement to a _witchwyrd beacon_ by Dismissing the effect. The attunement automatically ends if the attuned creature dies or if the attuned creature attunes themselves to a different _witchwyrd beacon_. The effect can also be dispelled normally. You can sense whenever the _witchwyrd beacon_ you are attuned to is activated in any way.
**Activate** 10 minutes (command, Interact) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** you are attuned to the _witchwyrd beacon_; **Effect** You place the _witchwyrd beacon_ on a flat, stable, and immobile surface, then adjust its rings to link it to the site. Once linked, any creature can use a teleportation effect to target the _witchwyrd beacon_ directly, regardless of line of sight. You can [[Dimension Door]] or [[Gate]] to the beacon as if you could see its location, and if you travel to it via an effect like [[Plane Shift]], the beacon eliminates the imprecision of the spell. The beacon doesn't change the range of effects, only their accuracy. Once the beacon is used in this manner, it loses its link and must be reactivated again to grant this benefit to attuned creatures.
