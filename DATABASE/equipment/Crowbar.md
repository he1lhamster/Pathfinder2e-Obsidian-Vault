When [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Forcing Open]] an object that doesn't have an easy grip, a crowbar makes it easier to gain the necessary leverage. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to Force Open (similar to using a shoddy item).
