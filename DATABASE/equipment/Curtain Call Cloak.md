This blue velvet cloak is cut from the remains of a curtain from a destroyed theater. When worn, you gain a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks while acting, orating, or singing, as the cloak makes minor motions to accentuate your performance.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You take a bow, spread your arms, and the cloak casts 4th-level [[DATABASE/domain/Darkness Domain|darkness]] centered on a corner of your space. This darkness doesn't impede your vision. While the darkness persists, it emits noise like the applauding of a moderately sized crowd.
