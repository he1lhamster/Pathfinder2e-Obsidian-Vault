This elegant journal has a detailed social dossier on the owner's acquaintances. When you make your daily preparations, you can inscribe a secret or embarrassing foible about a specific individual that you know to be true or have on good authority.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** If your next action is to cast an enchantment spell on a target about whom you've written an entry in the book, you can state that secret or foible before Casting the Spell to give the target a –1 circumstance penalty to their saving throw against the spell. The inscription then disappears from the grimoire.
