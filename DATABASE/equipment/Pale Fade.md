Pale fade is a white ointment with a sharp, earthy scent. The poison rapidly desiccates flesh, which then crumbles and forms a cloud of pallid dust. If the victim is [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] by this poison, then the cloud of dust also conceals other creatures from the victim.
 **Saving Throw** DC 42 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 10d6 poison damage and [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] (1 round); Stage 2 12d6 poison damage, drained 1, and concealed (1 round); **Stage 3** 15d6 poison damage, drained 1, and concealed (1 round)
