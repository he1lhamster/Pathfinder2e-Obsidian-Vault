This potent necromantic serum is distilled from the body of an intelligent corporeal undead who seeks to establish absolute control over their undead minions. The raw materials of a _necrobinding serum_ are composed of a slurry made from the creator's own flesh and blood mixed with pulped fungal toxins. The exact ingredients vary, but the act of brewing a _necrobinding serum_ is typically viewed with distaste at best and, in many societies, is regarded as an evil act. While _necrobinding serum_ isn't a poison, its method of delivery is identical to that of an injury poison—it's applied to a weapon that's then used to Strike an undead target (living creatures suffer no additional effect from exposure to a dose of _necrobinding serum_).
 When an undead creature is targeted by a dose of _necrobinding serum_, it must attempt a DC 19 Will save.
**Critical Success** The undead creature is unaffected.
**Success** The undead creature is momentarily disoriented; it takes a –1 status penalty to all attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.
**Failure** The undead creature becomes [[Friendly]] toward you. If it was already friendly, it becomes [[Helpful]]. It can't use hostile actions against you. This effect persists for 8 hours if the undead is mindless. Against other undead, the effect gains the mental trait and persists for 10 minutes.
**Critical Failure** The undead creature becomes helpful toward you and can't use hostile actions against you. This effect persists for 24 hours if the undead is mindless. Against other undead, the effect gains the mental trait and persists for 1 hour.
**Craft Requirements** You must be a corporeal undead, and the serum must include some of your flesh and blood.
