This _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Resilient|resilient]] [[DATABASE/armor/Coral Armor|coral armor]]_, often favored by allies of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Merfolk|merfolk]] and aquatic [[DATABASE/ancestry/Elf|elves]], is made of living coral carefully harvested from the ocean depths. Legends speak of a variety of similar coral armors with distinct powers, but surface-dwellers know of _reef heart_ as a magic armor that makes it easier for them to travel under the sea. _Reef heart_ enables you to breathe underwater and gives you a swim Speed equal to half your land Speed.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command, envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Coral Eruption|coral eruption]]. If you conjure the coral underwater, it ceases dealing damage after 1 minute, but its duration is unlimited. If the magical coral remains in place for 1 year, it becomes non-magical coral from which a reef might grow.
