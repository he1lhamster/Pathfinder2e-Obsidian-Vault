This long, golden cloak is among the royal regalia of the emperors of Taldor. It was fashioned from the pelt of [[DATABASE/monster/Grogrisant|Grogrisant]] itself, after being slain by Taldaris, and Grogrisant's mane was fashioned into a thick fringe that runs all along the mantle's edges. The paws of the Grogrisant cross beneath the wearer's throat, giving you an imposing appearance. The _Mantle of the Grogrisant_ grants you fire resistance 15 and physical resistance 5 (except bludgeoning).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision, Interact (evocation, incapacitation, light, primal, visual) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You pull the hood of the mantle over your face, revealing the six eyes of Grogrisant. The mantle gives off a flash of blinding light in a 60-foot emanation. All enemies within this area must attempt a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw. On a failure, they're [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 minute. On a critical failure, they're permanently blinded.
