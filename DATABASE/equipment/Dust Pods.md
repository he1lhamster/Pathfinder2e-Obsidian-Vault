You hide fragile pods of pollen or other clinging powder that get in the eyes of the first creature that enters the snare’s square. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Reflex saving throw. A creature [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] by the pollen can use an Interact action to attempt a DC 5 flat check to remove the condition.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is dazzled for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature is dazzled for 10 minutes.
**Critical Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round and dazzled for 10 minutes after.
