You carefully pack rare, heat-absorbing powders into a specially prepared clay vessel, then bury the vessel in the ground up to its neck. When a creature enters the square, the vessel's neck shatters, dispersing the powders into the air. The powder instantly douses non-magical fires the size of a campfire or smaller within 10 feet of the snare. The creature triggering the snare must attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to avoid getting powder in its face. A creature [[Blinded]] or [[Dazzled]] by the powder can use an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 flat check; on a success, it removes the condition. On a failure, it can try again, with a DC of 5 on the next Interact check. If it fails a second time, it automatically removes the condition with a third Interact action.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is dazzled for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature is blinded until the end of its next turn and dazzled for 1 minute afterwards.
**Critical Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 minute and dazzled for 10 minutes afterwards.
