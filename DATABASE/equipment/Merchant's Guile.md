The band of this ring is made from blue-colored iron and has two sharp, decorative protrusions on each side of the red-stone inlay. It feels quite heavy and reliable. Wearing this ring grants you a +2 item bonus to [[Deception]] and [[Diplomacy]] checks, but only if the associated checks involve haggling or bargaining over a purchase or trade.
