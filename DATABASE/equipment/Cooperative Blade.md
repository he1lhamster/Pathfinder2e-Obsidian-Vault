This _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_ has a mirror-like blade free of tarnish despite being millennia old. While wielding it, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]]. If you're an expert with the skill or attack roll you're using to Aid and you critically succeed, you grant your ally a +3 circumstance bonus to the triggering check instead of a +2 bonus.
