Sold only in single sticks, this foul incense comes coated with a bevy of alchemical smoke that activates in the presence of intense heat, releasing its namesake pungent odor. Adding this catalyst to a [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Fire|wall of fire]] spell fills all squares adjacent to the wall with thick, foul smoke. Creatures in this area are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and other creatures are concealed to creatures in the area. The smoke lasts for the duration of the spell.
