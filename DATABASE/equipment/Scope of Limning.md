The dwarven gunsmiths of Dongun Hold originally created these scopes to help them clear out vermin in underground areas. This scope captures the sound that echoes off a creature hit by the firearm and transforms it into light, illuminating the target for all to see.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact (auditory, [[DATABASE/spell/Light|light]], transmutation) ; **Effect** If your next Strike from the weapon to which the scope is attached hits a creature, the sound of the impact transforms into light, causing the creature to glow until the end of your next turn. A visible creature can't be [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] while they glow. If a creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], they're concealed while glowing, rather than being [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]]. Because the effect requires a solid impact, incorporeal creatures are unaffected unless the bullet can deal force damage or has the effects of the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] property rune.
