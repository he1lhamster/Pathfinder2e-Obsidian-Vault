The dwarven gunsmiths of Dongun Hold originally created these scopes to help them clear out vermin in underground areas. This scope captures the sound that echoes off a creature hit by the firearm and transforms it into light, illuminating the target for all to see.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact (auditory, [[Light]], transmutation) ; **Effect** If your next Strike from the weapon to which the scope is attached hits a creature, the sound of the impact transforms into light, causing the creature to glow until the end of your next turn. A visible creature can't be [[Concealed]] while they glow. If a creature is [[Invisible]], they're concealed while glowing, rather than being [[Undetected]]. Because the effect requires a solid impact, incorporeal creatures are unaffected unless the bullet can deal force damage or has the effects of the [[Ghost Touch]] property rune.
