An alchemist with the [[Craft Philosopher's Stone]] feat can create a philosopher's stone once per month by spending 1 batch of infused reagents during their daily preparations using the advanced alchemy class feature. This is the only way to create a philosopher's stone.
 At a glance, a philosopher's stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of natural rock. Breaking the rock open with a [[Force Open]] action (DC 35) reveals a cavity at the stone's heart. The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can transmute base metals into precious metals or create an [[Elixir of Rejuvenation]]. 
 To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in [[Crafting]] and have the [[Alchemical Crafting]] feat. You can then use the stone's quicksilver for one of two effects:

* You can apply the stone's quicksilver to an infused [[Elixir of Life]] using an Interact action. This turns the elixir into an infused [[Elixir of Rejuvenation]] instantaneously. This doesn't require any crafting time or additional materials. 
* You can spend up to a month of downtime applying the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create gold. Treat this as a 20th-level task to [[Earn Income]] using Crafting, except that you create 500 gp worth of your chosen metal per day on a success or 750 gp worth per day on a critical success.
