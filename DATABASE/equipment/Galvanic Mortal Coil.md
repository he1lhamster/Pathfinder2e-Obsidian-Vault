This porous steel coil wraps around a shard of onyx, supplementing the closely guarded science of [[Galvasphere]] with the magic of necromancy. When embedded in a body comprised of flesh, the blood and other fluids catalyze electrical pulses within the coil, activating the necromantic energies. In living creatures, this causes a dangerous surge that can damage the heart. In corpses, however, this can create a limited window of reanimation, with access to the corpse's final memories. _Galvanic mortal coils_ are even rarer than other galvaspheres, and thought by most to be merely hypothetical.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You drive the coil into a living creature that has 0 HP while attaching the other end to yourself, in order to damage their heart and possibly siphon their life force. The galvanic mortal coil casts [[Death Knell]] on the creature (DC 27).
**Activate** (10 minutes) Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** implant the coil into a corpse. The coil casts [[Talking Corpse]] on the body.
