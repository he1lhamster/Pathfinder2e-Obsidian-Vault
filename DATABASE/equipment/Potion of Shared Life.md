Two swirling liquids fill this flask, each slightly distinct in color and brightness from the other. When you drink this potion, you consume only half of the contents. If another willing creature consumes the remainder of the contents within 1 minute, your vitalities become linked for 1 minute from the moment the second one of you drinks. The two of you share breath, so as long as you're within 60 feet of one another, neither of you can begin suffocating unless you're both suffocating. You both gain the following reaction.
 **Share Life** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Your linked ally takes damage and is within 60 feet; **Effect** The ally takes half damage from the triggering effect (rounded down), and you lose a number of Hit Points equal to the remainder of the damage. You can't trigger this reaction to share damage caused by your ally using this reaction.
