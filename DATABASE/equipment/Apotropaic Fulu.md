This unassuming yellow paper, affixed above a door or gate, flickers in the light. Pick an alignment trait: chaotic, good, lawful, or evil. When a creature with the opposing alignment trait of the fulu (good for an evil fulu, and so on) passes through the entrance, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 2]]; regardless of whether they succeed, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 day.
