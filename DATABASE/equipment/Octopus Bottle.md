Miniature [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Octopus|octopus]] arms press up against the sides of this bottle, obscuring the rest of its contents. When opened, a Huge octopus bursts forth, which can appear in water instead of on the ground. Its arms attempt to grasp a creature with a reach of 15 feet. The octopus repositions that creature to a different space within its reach unless the target succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save.
 If the octopus is in water, it then releases a cloud of ink in a 30-foot emanation. This cloud has no effect outside of water. Creatures inside the cloud are [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] and can't use their sense of smell. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a [[DATABASE/monster/Giant Octopus|giant octopus]] corpse.
