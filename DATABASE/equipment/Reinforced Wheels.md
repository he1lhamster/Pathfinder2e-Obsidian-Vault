The chair's wheels have been reinforced with tough, metal rims or a metal cap. While in the chair, you gain a wheel Strike. Your wheel deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and has the agile, attached, and free-hand traits. A reinforced wheel is a simple melee weapon in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Club|club]] weapon group. You can etch weapon runes onto reinforced wheels. A wheelchair can only have one attached weapon.
