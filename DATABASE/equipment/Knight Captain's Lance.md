The appearance of this beautifully crafted _+2 [[Disrupting]] [[Striking]] [[Lance]]_ changes to match the armor of its wielder. It has a cloth flag attached behind the lance point that displays whatever heraldry the wielder wishes. If a cavalier with the [[Cavalier's Banner]] feat takes the knight captain's lance, it instead automatically displays the banner of their pledge.
