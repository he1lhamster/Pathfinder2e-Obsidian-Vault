The appearance of this beautifully crafted _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|disrupting]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Lance|lance]]_ changes to match the armor of its wielder. It has a cloth flag attached behind the lance point that displays whatever heraldry the wielder wishes. If a cavalier with the [[DATABASE/feat/Cavalier's Banner|Cavalier's Banner]] feat takes the knight captain's lance, it instead automatically displays the banner of their pledge.
