Many of the experienced woodcarvers of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]] learn to fight as well, the better to travel into hazardous areas in search of rare and beautiful types of wood for their craft. A _carver-cutter_ serves a dual role as a weapon and a tool for felling trees and engraving wood. The _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Battle Axe|battle axe]]_ looks like an exquisitely made woodcutting axe.
**Activate****—Carving Chisel** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, manipulate); **Effect** You pull free a woodworking chisel stored in the knob of the axe. It can have any standard chisel shape you imagine as you activate this ability. You get a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] checks for woodworking if you use chisels from the _carver-cutter_. The chisel also functions as a [[DATABASE/weapon/Main-gauche|main-gauche]]. All runes on the axe are replicated on the chisel, but only while both items are on the same person. You can Interact to reinsert the chisel.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Chop Down **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** Make a Strike with the axe against a plant creature or a creature made primarily of wood. This Strike deals an additional 2d6 precision damage, and on a hit, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] for 1 minute.
