This stone-headed _+2 striking [[Returning]] [[Javelin]]_ draws forth the power of the earth itself to strike at enemies.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You hurl the _stoneraiser javelin_ at an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The javelin’s power flows into the ground, which erupts in a 5-foot-radius burst of razor-sharp stalagmites. The stalagmites are 10 feet tall. Everything on each side of the stalagmites has cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the stalagmites’ spaces are difficult terrain. A creature takes 4d4 piercing damage for every move action it takes that enters at least one of the affected spaces. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 30 Hit Points. It’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section can be moved through freely. The stalagmites crumble to dust after 1 minute. 
Any creature in the area when the stalagmites appear is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space of its choice; this movement is forced movement. Pushed creatures must attempt a DC 28 Reflex saving throw or take 4d4 piercing damage.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is knocked [[Prone]].
