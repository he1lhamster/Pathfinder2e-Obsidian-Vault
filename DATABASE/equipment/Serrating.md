A _serrating_ weapon’s bladed edge separates into jagged, swirling shards that spin along the blade. When dealing slashing damage, the weapon deals an additional 1d4 damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You brandish the weapon and focus its power, causing the serrated shards to buzz as they spin at a dizzying speed. On your next hit with the weapon this turn that deals slashing damage, the _serrating_ rune adds an additional 1d12 damage instead of the additional 1d4 damage, and then the shards return to their usual speed.
