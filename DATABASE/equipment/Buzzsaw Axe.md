With an aerodynamic cutting edge and a curved handle, this _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Battle Axe|battle axe]]_ is perfectly suited to whirling motions, and in fact seems like it wants to whirl free from your grip. A Strike with this axe that benefits from the sweep trait's circumstance bonus on attack rolls also gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You hurl the axe, which spins at great speed as it flies to a distant point and returns to you, leaving a trail of carnage. Each creature in a 120-foot line must succeed at a DC 28 basic Reflex save or take damage equal to the weapon's melee damage, including your Strength modifier.
