Zarmavdian's spellbook, _Thresholds of Truth_, was once a straightforward treatise on arcane and occult lore containing several useful spells. It's been so heavily annotated, however, that the original text is hard to read. It's clear that Zarmavdian wanted to prevent eldritch creatures from manipulating innocent minds, but his spellbook is a treasure trove for those seeking dangerous or inscrutable lore. The bookseller Morlibint currently keeps this book in his collection at Odd Stories. _Thresholds of Truth_ provides access to the [[Eldritch Researcher]] archetype and contains the following spells.
**Cantrips**: [[Chill Touch]], [[Dancing Lights]], [[Daze]], [[Detect Magic]], [[Electric Arc]], [[Ghost Sound]], [[Mage Hand]], [[Light]], [[Prestidigitation]], [[Read Aura]], [[Shield]]
**1st Level**: [[Alarm]], [[Charm]], [[Color Spray]], [[Mage Armor]], [[Magic Missile]], [[True Strike]], [[Unseen Servant]]
**2nd Level**: [[Comprehend Language]], [[Dispel Magic]], [[False Life]], [[Glitterdust]], [[Web]]
**3rd Level**: [[Haste]], [[Lightning Bolt]], [[Locate]], [[Paralyze]], [[Slow]]
**4th Level**: [[Clairvoyance]], [[Daydreamer's Curse]], [[Resilient Sphere]]
