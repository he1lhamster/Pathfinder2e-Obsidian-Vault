A glistening, tar-like substance that's displeasing to the touch coats a _black tendril shot_. When the activated ammunition hits a target, it exudes tendrils that encase the target, which must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The ammunition's effects last until the target [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]]. DCs for the saving throw and Escape vary by type.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Escape the ammunition's effect.
**Failure** The target is slowed 1.
**Critical Failure** The target is slowed 2.
