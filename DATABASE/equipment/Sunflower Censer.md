This gold-and-ivory incense burner always emits a pleasant, floral-scented smoke without any need to be refilled. It has a chain that can be easily affixed to a belt or bag, allowing it to be worn without a free hand. As long as the censer is burning, the bearer benefits from the [[Undetectable Alignment]] spell. They also don't appear undead to divination spells or abilities, or to senses such as [[Lifesense]], unless those abilities successfully counteract the censer. The censer can be lit or extinguished with an Interact action.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** Smoke bellows from the censer with the effects of an [[Obscuring Mist]] centered on you.
