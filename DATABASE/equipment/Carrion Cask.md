This stylized, palm-sized box contains a black, ooze-like substance that can easily devour a corpse in moments, breaking the body down into a necromantic sludge.
**Activate** Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You feed a corpse of a Small-sized or larger creature to the cask, little by little. The activation requires a three-action activity for a Small or Medium creature, a 1-minute activity for a Larger creature, and a 10-minute activity for a Huge creature. A Gargantuan creature is too large for the cask to devour.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** The _carrion cask_ has consumed a corpse since the last time it was activated; **Effect** You release the sludge from the _carrion cask's_ last meal in a pulse of necromantic energy. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take 6d6 negative damage, with a DC 24 basic Fortitude save.
