This large ram’s horn perpetually glistens with tiny droplets of water, much like condensation.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You activate the horn by blowing deeply into it, causing it to issue forth a low blast and cast a 2nd-level [[DATABASE/spell/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]] spell. You can Dismiss the mist at any time by blowing a second note on the horn using an Interact action.
