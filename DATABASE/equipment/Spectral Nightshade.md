Belladonna cultivated in planes hazardous to living visitors, such as the [[Shadow Plane]] or the [[Boneyard]], grow with a strange, skeletal look to their branches. The leaves and berries of these extraplanar plants are partly incorporeal and significantly more toxic than [[Belladonna]] grown on the [[Material Plane]]. When imbued with spirit-twisting magic, _spectral nightshade_ quickly drains away the victim's vitality and makes colors painfully bright and bewildering. _Spectral nightshade_ doesn't affect creatures that have no spirit; if a possessing spirit inhabits a body that takes poison damage from spectral nightshade, the possessor takes an equal amount of force damage, even if the possessor can't be affected directly by poisons.
 **Saving Throw** DC 33 Fortitude; **Onset** 1 minute; **Maximum Duration** 6 minutes; **Stage 1** 10d6 poison damage and [[Dazzled]] (1 minute); **Stage 2** 13d6 poison damage and [[Drained]] (1 minute); **Stage 3** 15d6 poison damage, [[Confused]], and drained 2 (1 minute)
**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of [[Spirit Blast]].
