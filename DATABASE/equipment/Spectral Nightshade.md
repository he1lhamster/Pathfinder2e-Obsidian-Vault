Belladonna cultivated in planes hazardous to living visitors, such as the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] or the [[DATABASE/plane/Boneyard|Boneyard]], grow with a strange, skeletal look to their branches. The leaves and berries of these extraplanar plants are partly incorporeal and significantly more toxic than [[DATABASE/equipment/Belladonna|belladonna]] grown on the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]. When imbued with spirit-twisting magic, _spectral nightshade_ quickly drains away the victim's vitality and makes colors painfully bright and bewildering. _Spectral nightshade_ doesn't affect creatures that have no spirit; if a possessing spirit inhabits a body that takes poison damage from spectral nightshade, the possessor takes an equal amount of force damage, even if the possessor can't be affected directly by poisons.
