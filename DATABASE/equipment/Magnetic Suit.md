This magnetized suit is strapped to your body over your armor or clothes. When you Activate it, you must choose whether to set it to attract or repel.
 While set to attract, you take a –1 item penalty to your AC against attacks made by metal weapons, while creatures within a 5-foot emanation other than you gain a +1 item bonus to their AC. If set to repel, you gain a +1 item bonus to AC against attacks made with metal weapons. While attracting metal, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]] metal objects and [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] metal creatures and a –1 item penalty to Athletics checks to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] metal creatures. While repelling metal, you gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Shove metal creatures, but you take a –1 item penalty to Climb metal objects and Grapple metal creatures.
