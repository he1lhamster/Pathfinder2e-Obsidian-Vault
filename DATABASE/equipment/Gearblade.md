Shaped like a blade made from spinning gears, this _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] weapon_ can catch enemy weapons and grind up foes. In order to function, the _gearblade_ must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. During this process, you can reconfigure the weapon to transform into a [[DATABASE/weapon/Bastard Sword|bastard sword]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Greatsword|greatsword]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Longsword|longsword]], or [[DATABASE/weapon/Shortsword|shortsword]]. It then gains all the features of the chosen weapon except that its Bulk is always 2 and it gains the disarm weapon trait and the versatile B weapon trait (which replaces any other versatile trait the weapon might have). If you don't wind the _gearblade_, it becomes inert and has the statistics of a [[DATABASE/weapon/Greatclub|greatclub]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You roll a critical success to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] a target with the _gearblade_; **Requirements** You've wound the _gearblade_ for 10 minutes within the last 24 hours; **Effect** The target's weapon is pulled through the _gearblade's_ gears and shoots out the other side, landing 20 feet away in a direction of your choice. The target must attempt a DC 36 Reflex save. On a failure, the limb holding their weapon is also pulled into the _gearblade_, and the creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage. On a critical failure, they take 6d12 bludgeoning damage and the limb becomes unusable until healed by a [[DATABASE/spell/Regenerate|regenerate]] spell or a similar effect.
