This finely crafted, seemingly mundane parchment is useful for writing sensitive documents. When words are written on this parchment, they instantly scramble into unrecognizable script, requiring a DC 20 check to [[DATABASE/action/Decipher Writing|Decipher Writing]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command ; **Effect** The scrambled words align into the originally written script. Identifying the parchment reveals that it can be activated with a command, but a critical success to [[DATABASE/action/Identify Magic|Identify Magic]] is needed to learn the command word.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You light the parchment on fire, burning the words off while leaving the parchment unharmed and ready to bear more text.
