This red maple wand carved into a tongue of flame feels warm in your hand.
**Activate** Cast a Spell **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Faerie Fire|faerie fire]]. For the duration of the spell, you can use the limning flames as a source for your magic. Creatures affected by your _faerie fire_ must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or take a –2 status penalty to their Will saves against enchantment and illusions spells as long as they are affected by _faerie fire_. You can cast an enchantment or illusion spell on such a creature up to a distance twice the spell's normal range. If the spell has a range of touch, or doesn't have a range, it is unaffected by the increase in range from the _faerie fire_.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _faerie fire_.
