This small, enchanted bone (most often a jaw) is usually capped with metal at its ends. It's activated by striking it against a hard surface.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** The bone begins recording the next 1 minute of ambient sounds (including speech) that require a DC 15 or lower Perception check to hear. The bone's recording doesn't copy magical auditory effects, such as those of spellcasting, a [[DATABASE/monster/Harpy|harpy's]] song, or a [[DATABASE/monster/Banshee|banshee's]] wail. Once the _rhythm bone_ has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** The bone replays its recorded sounds.
**Craft Requirements** supply a casting of [[DATABASE/spell/Ghost Sound|ghost sound]].
