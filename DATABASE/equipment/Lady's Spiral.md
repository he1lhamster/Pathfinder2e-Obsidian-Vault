This _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|disrupting]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Whip|whip]]_ has a single strip of anointed leather wrapped around its hilt in a spiral pattern. The handle of the whip ends in an oak spike that has been sanctified with ashes from [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma's]] [[DATABASE/plane/Boneyard|Boneyard]]. If the spike is used to stake a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire|vampire]] that's vulnerable to being staked, the vampire is immediately destroyed, without having to sever its head and anoint it with [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy Water|holy water]]. If the whip is buried with a creature, that creature can't rise as an undead as long as the whip remains by its side.
