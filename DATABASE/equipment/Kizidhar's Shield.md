This [[DATABASE/equipment/Darkwood Shield|standard-grade duskwood shield]] is perfectly symmetrical and incredibly sturdy despite its elaborate construction. These shields are typically given to the chosen emissaries of a [[DATABASE/monster/Kizidhar Shuyookh|kizidhar shuyookh]], and the shuyookh's name and title are engraved in [[DATABASE/language/Muan|Muan]] behind the shield's handle.
**Activate****—Repair** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You command the shield to repair itself, awakening the restorative magic within. For the next minute, the shield heals 3 Hit Points each round at the start of your turn.
**Activate****—Secure Site** 10 minutes (manipulate); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You place the _kizidhar's shield_ into the ground at the edge of your campsite, which can't be more than 30 feet on a side, then speak the name of the kizidhar shuyookh carved into its handle. The shuyookh briefly appears just long enough to make a sweeping gesture, causing sprawling thorns to grow in an unnaturally symmetrical formation around the campsite, protecting it for the next 8 hours with an effect that's otherwise identical to [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Thorns|wall of thorns]]. All creatures within the campsite are then immediately affected by a three-action [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] spell cast at 4th rank by the shield. After 8 hours, the wall rots away, and the shield can be retrieved as an Interact action.
