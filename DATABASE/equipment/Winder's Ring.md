This ring contains dozens of minute, interlocking bronze gears that buzz incessantly. The ring grants you a +1 item bonus to all [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] checks to construct or repair clockworks.
**Activate** varies (Interact) ; **Effect** The _winder's ring_ extends a winding key that fits any clockwork contraption or creature, allowing you to fully wind a clockwork device or creature in half the usual time. When you activate a _winder's ring_ in this way, attempt a DC 16 flat check. On a failure, the _winder's ring_ exhausts itself, and you can't activate it again until the next time you make your daily preparations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The _winder's ring_ transforms into a [[DATABASE/monster/Clockwork Spy|clockwork spy]] that doesn't require winding and obeys your spoken commands for up to 1 hour. In this form, the _winder's ring_ has the minion trait. You can use this action again to return the clockwork spy to _winder's ring_ form as long as you're adjacent to the clockwork spy. If the clockwork spy is slain, it reverts to its ring shape, and the _winder's ring_ can't be activated again until 1 week has passed.
