After you drink this mutagen, your skin continually renews itself, thickening into large, scaly patches.
**Benefit** For 1 minute, you gain fast healing 2 and automatically succeed at flat checks to recover from [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]].
**Drawback** Your thickened skin makes quick movement difficult, and your excess skin flakes off with the slightest movement. You take a –2 penalty to Reflex saves for 1 minute. Any creature attempting to [[DATABASE/action/Track|Track]] you in the next 24 hours gains a +4 circumstance bonus to their check.
