Alcohol is a common substance available in stunning variety. The Price of a dose of alcohol depends on the specific beverage. You can’t recover from the [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] condition from alcohol while affected.
 If you fail a saving throw against alcohol other than initial saves, the affliction’s stage doesn’t increase; the only way to increase the stage of alcohol’s affliction is to consume more alcohol.
