Rotating gears cover the outside of this imposing helmet. In order to function, the device must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. The _clockwork helm_ has a calming and focusing effect on the mind. If you're affected by a detrimental condition caused by a mental or emotion effect, each round at the beginning of your turn, the gears of the helmet unwind and reduce the value of the condition by 1. This effect works only if the condition's value can normally be reduced by simply waiting; otherwise the helmet has no effect.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** You've wound the _clockwork helm_ for 10 minutes within the last 24 hours; **Effect** You fire a beam of withering heat from the helmet's eye slits at a target. Make a spell or ranged attack roll (your choice) to affect the target. On a hit, the target takes 10d8 fire damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]].
