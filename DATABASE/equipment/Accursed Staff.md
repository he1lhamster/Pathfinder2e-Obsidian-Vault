Iron strips line the body of an _accursed staff_, capping the bottom and folding into an intricate knot at the top. While wielding an _accursed staff_, you're empowered by the curses you inflict. If an enemy fails a saving throw against a spell you cast that has the curse trait, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double that spell's level. These temporary Hit Points last 10 minutes. The enemy must be a significant threat and can't have been a willing subject of the curse.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
