As long as this card is invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], and to all checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Search|Research]] while using the Research subsystem from the _Gamemastery Guide_. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.
