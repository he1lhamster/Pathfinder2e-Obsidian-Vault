An _inspiring spotlight_ is a bulky contraption consisting of a drum-shaped metal housing around several reflective metal plates. Two handles on either side, each with a small button, allow you to aim the spotlight outward from your body.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** Once per hour; **Effect** When you push the left-hand button, the _inspiring spotlight_ emits a beam of bright magical light in a 120-foot line that hangs in the air and remains in place even if you move the spotlight. If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the _inspiring spotlight_ attempts to counteract the darkness. Creatures within the line gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, creatures in the line who are [[Frightened]] reduce the value of their frightened condition by 1 at the beginning of each turn they start in the area of the line. The beam remains in place for 1 minute or until you push the right-hand button with another Interact action to extinguish the light.
