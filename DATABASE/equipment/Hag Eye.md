This item appears to be an ordinary semiprecious stone and is typically mounted on a brooch or ring, but the stone is, in fact, an eyeball. This illusion can be seen through with [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]] or similar magic, and anyone who interacts with the item feels its wet and sticky surface, allowing them to attempt to disbelieve the illusion (DC 19). Many hags claim a _hag eye_ is more effective if plucked from a living, awake creature, but this is likely just a convenient excuse for sadism.
 The _hag eye_ produces no direct benefit for the wearer, but allows the [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Hag|hag]] who created it, or any member of her coven, can peer through the eye using the [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] action. This has no range limit, provided the hag is on the same plane.
 Any damage dealt to the eye destroys it. If this happens while a hag is looking through it, the hag is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 hour.
**Craft Requirements** You must be a hag.

A _frightful hag eye_ is made with the eye of a creature whose gaze inflicts fear, such as some velstracs.

_Oracular hag eyes_ are made with the eye of a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Cyclops|cyclops]]. A hag who casts [[DATABASE/spell/Augury|augury]] with an _oracular hag eye_ in her possession reduces the DC of the secret flat check to 2.

A _smoky hag eye_ is named after the black vapor that constantly emanates from it, like the smoke that continually seeps from a [[DATABASE/monster/Bodak|bodak's]] eye.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (death, necromancy, visual) ; **Effect** You target a creature within 30 feet that must be able to see the _smoky hag eye_. The target must attempt a DC 24 Fortitude save. Once a creature attempts this save, it's temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]].
**Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]] and drained 2.
**Critical Failure** The creature is doomed 1 and drained 3.

## Hag Eye (Stoney)<span class="item-type">Item 6</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 182. Graveclaw|Pathfinder #182: Graveclaw]]
**Price** 250 gp
**Usage** worn
A _stony hag eye_ is fashioned from the eye of a creature, such a [[DATABASE/monster/Basilisk|basilisk]] or [[DATABASE/monster/Medusa|medusa]], with a petrifying gaze.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (incapacitation, transmutation, visual) **Trigger** once per round; **Effect** You target a creature within 30 feet that can see the _stony hag eye_. The target must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save. On a failure, it's [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 minute; on a critical failure, if the creature is already slowed, it's permanently [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]]. Touching the _stony hag eye_ to the petrified creature (a single action with the manipulate trait) removes the petrified condition.
