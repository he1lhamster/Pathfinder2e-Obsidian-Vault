Each _specialist's ring_ is dedicated to a single school of magic, and the ring is covered in symbols and glyphs related to that school according to the creator's arcane studies. A _specialist's ring_ has the trait corresponding to its school of magic. You gain a +2 item bonus to [[Arcana]] checks, and a +1 circumstance bonus to recognize magical effects and items of the specific school of magic.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast a wizard school spell of the corresponding school. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.
