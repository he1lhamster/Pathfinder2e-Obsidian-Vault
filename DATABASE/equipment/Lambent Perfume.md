This ceramic incense burner is shaped like a three-headed ibis in the form of [[DATABASE/deity/Atreia|Atreia]], spreading his wings and preparing to take flight; it hangs on a thin, golden chain.
**Activate****—Light Incense** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (aura, manipulate); **Cost** incense worth at least 1 sp; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Sparkling golden mist escapes the ibis's open beaks, spreading in a 20-foot emanation. This perfume mist is calming and restorative. A creature that ends its turn within the censer's smoke while [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] or under an affliction can attempt a new saving throw to overcome it. A creature with multiple afflictions, or that is both sickened and has an affliction, chooses one to attempt to overcome each time it ends its turn in the aura. After attempting a new saving throw against an affliction, a creature is temporarily immune to _lambent perfume_ for the purpose of overcoming that affliction for 24 hours.
