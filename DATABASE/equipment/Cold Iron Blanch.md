You can pour a vial of this dark liquid onto one melee weapon, one thrown weapon, or 10 pieces of ammunition. When used on a melee or thrown weapon, rather than ammunition, the blanch lasts for the listed duration or 10 successful Strikes, whichever comes first. When you use it on ammunition, the blanch is expended on a given piece of ammunition after firing it, whether it hits or not. A cold iron blanch contains small amounts of [[DATABASE/equipment/Alchemist's Fire|alchemist's fire]], so it must be used all at once; an opened vial ignites to melt the cold iron onto the weapon and is quickly consumed. The weapon or ammunition counts as [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron|cold iron]] instead of its normal precious material (such as silver) for any physical damage it deals, if applicable.
