Burnt fulu ashes float in this liquid, lending a distinctive red color and imparting it with a variety of purifying effects. Unlike many fulu items, _fu water_ must be created using divine magic.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** This potion functions as a bottle of [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy Water|holy water]]. Like holy water, you throw it as a Strike. It's a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You drink the _fu water_ to counteract ailments within yourself. Attempt a counteract check with a +9 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 3 against one effect that imposes the [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]], [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] condition. You are then [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]].
