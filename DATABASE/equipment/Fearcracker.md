A _fearcracker_ contains fragments of broken mirrors and reagents that pop and smoke when consumed. When thrown down in your space as part of a [[DATABASE/spell/Mirror Image|mirror image]] spell, your and your images' appearance twists nightmarishly. When an image is destroyed, it “dies” in a disturbing fashion, rendering the attacker [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]]. This aspect of the spell has the emotion, fear, and mental traits.
