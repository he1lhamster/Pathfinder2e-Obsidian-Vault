This robe is made from dweomerweave, a magical fabric created by spinning minor illusions into the threads of [[DATABASE/monster/Ether Spider|ether spider]] silk. Dweomerweave is naturally hazy and translucent. It can take on the illusory appearances of other fabrics and garments, and _dweomerweave robes_ are coveted by adventurers who want to travel light without compromising on fashion.
**Activate** 1 minute (Interact) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain the effects of a 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Disguise|illusory disguise]] except that the illusion only alters the appearance of the _dweomerweave robe_, changing it into another garment with an appearance of your choice. The spell persists until the next activation. You can Dismiss the activation.
