_Bane oil_ comes in as many forms as the [[DATABASE/equipment/Bane|bane]] weapon property rune. Coating a weapon with the oil gives the weapon the benefit of one type of _bane_ rune for 1 minute. A weapon can be coated in only one type of _bane oil_ at a time. Any new application of this oil supersedes any previous one. If a weapon has the _bane_ rune, this oil has no effect if it's of the same type as the rune.
