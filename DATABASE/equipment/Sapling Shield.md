This surprisingly weighty, though well-balanced, wooden [[DATABASE/shield/Buckler|buckler]] is emblazoned with the image of a sapling. The sapling withers as the shield takes damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision ; **Effect** The buckler expands, with the sapling image growing into a mighty oak tree. The buckler becomes a [[DATABASE/shield/Tower Shield|tower shield]], gaining the corresponding AC bonus, Speed penalty, and ability to [[DATABASE/action/Take Cover|Take Cover]]. It keeps the same Hit Points and Broken Threshold, but its Hardness and Bulk increase by 2 in this form. The shield remains in this form until you Activate it again to revert it to a buckler.
