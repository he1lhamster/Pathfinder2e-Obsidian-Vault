This band of interwoven gold and copper, traced with [[DATABASE/language/Aklo|Aklo]] symbols, is topped with a gleaming, luminescent opal gently bleeding wisps of shadowstuff.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command ; **Effect** You attempt to make the ring cast an arcane [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] spell. However, if the ring doesn't deem the wish to be sufficiently selfless, the wish isn't cast and the ring can't be activated for 24 hours. You are [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 3]], whether or not the ring refuses the wish. Once the wish is cast, the _Ring of Recalcitrant Wishes_ has no powers, though it is rumored that the wearer's death in an act of profound self-sacrifice restores the _wish_ to the ring.
