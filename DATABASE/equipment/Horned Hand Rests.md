These thick bull or ram horns fuse into the armrests of your legchair companion, giving it more aggressive options. Your animal companion can only invest this item if it is a [[Legchair]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> or <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You trace your finger along the base of the ram horns, with an effect depending on how many actions you spent.
 <span class="action-icon">1</span> Your legchair draws force from its momentum. Until the end of this turn, if your legchair Strides, it deals 2d6 additional force damage on its next Strike and, on a critical success, pushes the target away by 5 feet.
 <span class="action-icon">2</span> Your legchair fires a beam of force from its ram horns. The target takes 4d6 force damage and must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage and is pushed 5 feet.
**Failure** The target takes full damage and is pushed 10 feet.
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is pushed 20 feet.
