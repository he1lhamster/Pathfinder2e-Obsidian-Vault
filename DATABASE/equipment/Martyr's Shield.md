A _martyr’s shield_ is a [[DATABASE/equipment/Sturdy Shield|lesser sturdy shield]] imbued with the compassion of a devout champion of a righteous deity, like [[DATABASE/deity/Iomedae|Iomedae]] or [[DATABASE/deity/Vildeis|Vildeis]], who sacrificed themself to save an ally. In addition to good-naturedly attempting to convert you to its religion, the _martyr’s shield_ can use 1 reaction each round that, when raised, it uses to [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] to protect an ally adjacent to you, with the effects of the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Warden|Shield Warden]] feat. The _martyr’s shield_ uses this reaction whether you would prefer it did so or not. The _martyr’s shield_ can be upgraded to a stronger form of _sturdy shield_ by paying the difference in cost between its current type of _sturdy shield_ and the new type.
