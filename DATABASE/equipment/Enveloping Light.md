This tattoo is a series of six concentric circles that show up as a soft yellow on any skin tone. The marks carry in them a protective force that bolsters your body and soul. The first time each day that someone attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Treat Wounds|Treat your Wounds]] and rolls a critical failure, they get a failure instead.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** For 5 rounds, your entire body begins to glow, with the effects of a 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Light|light]] spell. At the end of each of your turns during this time, you regain 1d4 Hit Points.
