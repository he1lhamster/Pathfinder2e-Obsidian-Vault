These small spikes can be used as anchors to make climbing easier. To affix a piton, you must hold it in one hand and use a hammer to drive it in with your other hand. You can attach a rope to the hammered piton so that you don't fall all the way to the ground on a critical failure while [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climbing]].
