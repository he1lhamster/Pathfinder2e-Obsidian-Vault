This leather mat bears intricate designs and symbols embossed into them to enhance the mystique of a harrow reading. The mat provides a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]], [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], and relevant [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] checks (such as Fortune-Telling Lore or Harrow Lore) to convince a creature that a harrow reading was accurate.
