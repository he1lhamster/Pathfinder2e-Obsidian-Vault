Yrisette developed these unique tattoos after months of tinkering and experimentation. This tattoo is always of a saying that has meaning to the person who wears it. While the words are hidden within a larger pattern and are nearly impossible to discern at a glance, they lend gravitas and power to the wearer's words. When the tattoo is applied, choose whether the phrase is of threatening words ([[Intimidation]]), persuasive words ([[Deception]]), or dramatic words ([[Performance]]).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You speak your meaningful phrase from your tattoo out loud, emboldening your words for 1 minute. During this time, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks and checks of the skill associated with your phrase. When you roll a critical failure on a Diplomacy check or the associated skill during this time, you get a failure instead.
