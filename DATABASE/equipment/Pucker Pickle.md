Sharp and pungent, but tasty, pucker pickles were created by [[Goblin]] [[Alchemist]] working to avoid being eaten by larger creatures. For 1 hour after eating a pucker pickle, you smell slightly of pickle, but you have a horrendous taste. Once a creature hits you with a Strike using an attack that allows it to taste you, such as a jaws Strike, it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to further attacks against you that allow it to taste you, including attacks like [[Grapple]] or [[Trip]] you using its jaws or [[Swallow Whole]]. Creatures, especially animals, often choose other targets after tasting you. Any creature that [[Engulf]] you or Swallows you Whole is [[Sickened]]. If it spends an action retching to reduce the sickened condition, you can attempt to [[Escape]] as a reaction.
