Sharp and pungent, but tasty, pucker pickles were created by [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblin]] [[DATABASE/class_/Alchemist|alchemists]] working to avoid being eaten by larger creatures. For 1 hour after eating a pucker pickle, you smell slightly of pickle, but you have a horrendous taste. Once a creature hits you with a Strike using an attack that allows it to taste you, such as a jaws Strike, it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to further attacks against you that allow it to taste you, including attacks like [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grappling]] or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Tripping]] you using its jaws or [[DATABASE/monsterability/Swallow Whole|Swallowing you Whole]]. Creatures, especially animals, often choose other targets after tasting you. Any creature that [[DATABASE/monsterability/Engulf|Engulfs]] you or Swallows you Whole is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. If it spends an action retching to reduce the sickened condition, you can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] as a reaction.
