Magical writing covers the surface of this beautiful conch shell, which emits a blue light from inside. A _conch of otherworldly seas_ is a [[DATABASE/equipment/Musical Instrument|virtuoso handheld musical instrument]] that grants a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks attempted while using it. 
The conch is a planar key for [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|interplanar teleport]] and similar magic to travel to the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]]. When using it this way, you can attune it to the waters of your destination to make it more likely to arrive where you intend to be, appearing 1d6×25 miles from your intended destination instead of 1d10×25 miles away.
**Activate****—Voice of Oceans** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate); **Effect** You hold the horn to your ear and can understand and speak [[DATABASE/language/Thalassic|Thalassic]] as long as it remains there.
**Activate****—Sounds of the Deep** 10 minutes (concentrate, manipulate); **Effect** You hold the horn to your ear and touch the correct series of runes inscribed on its surface, causing the conch to cast a 5th-rank [[DATABASE/spell/Clairaudience|clairaudience]] spell for your benefit. Provided you choose a location that's underwater, you can extend the spell's range to 1 mile and hear with perfect clarity.
