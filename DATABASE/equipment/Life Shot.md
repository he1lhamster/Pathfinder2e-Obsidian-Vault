Life shot is a special cartridge that carries a small dose of [[DATABASE/equipment/Elixir of Life|elixir of life]]. A creature hit by activated life shot takes no damage from the successful attack, instead receiving healing and gaining an item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 1 minute. On a critical hit, roll the healing received twice and take the better result (this is a fortune effect). A target willing to be hit by this attack is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against it.
