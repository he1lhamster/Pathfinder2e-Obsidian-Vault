This frothing fluid causes the drinker's body to exude trace odor-absorbing oils. For the listed duration after drinking this elixir, your scent is nearly unnoticeable. Creatures with imprecise scent don't detect you with that sense unless they [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] for you, and you are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] from creatures that perceive you with precise scent. You gain a +4 item bonus against attempts to Seek you by creatures using only scent-based senses; if they use any other senses as well, the bonus doesn't apply.
