These large masks are forged of precious metals or carved of wood and tasked with guarding the history of a family. Most Alijae are granted a _genealogy_ mask when they come of age, which they bequeath to their next of kin upon death. When a member of the family recounted in the _genealogy mask_ performs a particularly significant event while wearing the mask, its eyes and ears animate, allowing the item to witness and record the deeds for posterity. Different families have different standards for their _genealogy masks_—some may value accuracy and objective, clinical facts, while others may relish embellishing their stories to the very brink of believability in the name of a good story.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You ask the mask about the deeds of a particular ancestor, and the mask speaks for 10 minutes, recalling the tales it knows about that ancestor. The mask is limited by what information a particular ancestor shared with it.
