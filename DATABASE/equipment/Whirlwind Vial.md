Opening this vial releases a mighty gust, forming into a fearsome Huge [[DATABASE/monster/Elemental Hurricane|elemental hurricane]]. The elemental breathes a 30-foot cone of air. Each creature in the cone must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or be knocked away from the elemental. A creature knocked into a solid object stops moving and takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is pushed 10 feet.
**Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet.
**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet and knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
**Craft Requirements** Supply magical residue from a slain elemental hurricane.
