Made of a deep-brown rosewood, a _spurned lute_ is adorned with carved flowers. The lute appears to be and functions as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Musical Instrument|virtuoso instrument]]. (Other _spurned instruments_ exist, but the lute is the least rare.) This lute has a jealous streak, demanding total loyalty from its “partner” musician. After you play the lute for the first time, it fuses to you. If you go a day without using it to [[DATABASE/action/Perform|Perform]], you become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] until you next do so. After that, when you attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check using an instrument other than the lute, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to do so, and you must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become stupefied 1 for 1 minute.
