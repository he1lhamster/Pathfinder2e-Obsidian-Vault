This luminous mica dust fluoresces for a short time after being exposed to significant amounts of magical energy. When a creature fails its save against a cloud of [[DATABASE/spell/Glitterdust|glitterdust]] created using this catalyst, glowing grains stick to them, causing them to shed dim light in a 20-foot radius for as long as their invisibility is negated by the spell as well as causing them to take a –2 circumstance penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] for that duration.
