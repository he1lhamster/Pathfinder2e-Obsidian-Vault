## Dragon Damage Types

The _[[DATABASE/equipment/Dragonclaw Scutcheon|dragonclaw scutcheon]]_ and _dragontooth trophy_ work with a type of damage depending on what kind of dragon the claw or tooth came from. These items are typically made from [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Chromatic|chromatic]] or [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Metallic|metallic]] dragons, but your GM might introduce ones made from other types of dragons. These items are typically uncommon or rare, and use the damage type dealt by that dragon's breath weapon. | 0 | 1 | |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------| | Dragon Type | Damage Type | | [[Dragon, Black]] or [[Dragon, Copper]] | Acid | | [[Dragon, Blue]] or [[Dragon, Bronze]] | Electricity | | [[Dragon, Brass]], [[Dragon, Gold]], or [[Dragon, Red]] | Fire | | [[Dragon, Green]] | Poison | | [[Dragon, Silver]] or [[Dragon, White]] | Cold |

This imposing fang is engraved with an intricate arrangement of symbols, glyphs, and patterns and dangles from a leather strap bound to the hilt of the affixed weapon. When you Activate the trophy, your weapon is momentarily transformed into a magical construct of draconic fury. On the triggering Strike and until the end of your next turn, the damage type of the affixed weapon changes to the type matching the dragon the claw came from (see the sidebar). This change overrides the versatile trait and similar abilities.
**Craft Requirements** Supply one tooth from an adult or older dragon.
