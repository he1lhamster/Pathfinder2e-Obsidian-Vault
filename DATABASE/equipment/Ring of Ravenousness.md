Carved of acacia wood, a _ring of ravenousness_ is inlaid with a geometric pattern. The ring appears to be a _[[DATABASE/equipment/Ring of Sustenance|ring of sustenance]]_. Once you invest it, though, it fuses to you, its effects activating immediately. While wearing the ring, you require twice the normal amount of food and drink for a creature your size to avoid starvation and thirst.
