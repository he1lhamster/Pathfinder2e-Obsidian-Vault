As black as coal, this blade grows more potent in darkness. While in bright light, it functions as a _+1 [[DATABASE/weapon/Shortsword|shortsword]]_ and doesn’t appear to radiate a magic aura to [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] or similar spells unless the spells are 4th level or higher. 
 In dim light or darkness, the _gloom blade_ becomes a _+2 striking shortsword_. Whenever you use the _gloom blade_ to attack a creature you’re [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] by, you deal 1d6 additional precision damage. 
 To upgrade the _gloom blade’s_ fundamental runes, start with the base _+1 shortsword_, but if you improve it beyond a _+2 striking shortsword_, the runes apply in dim light or darkness as well.
