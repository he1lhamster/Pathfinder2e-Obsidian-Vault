**Activate****—Healing Pod** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate); **Effect** You break the snap pea pod in half, unleashing its restorative healing energy. Up to 5 creatures of your choice within 30 feet regain 4d8+10 Hit Points and gain a +2 item bonus to all saves against poisons or diseases for 1 minute.
**Activate****—Beanstalk** 10 minutes (manipulate); **Effect** You plant the _therapeutic snap peas_ in a square of open ground, after which they rapidly grow into a 10-foot-tall beanstalk that remains in place for 8 hours. The beanstalk's enormous pea pods provide a full day's food for up to 8 living creatures of size Large or smaller, which must be eaten before the beanstalk expires. Any creature that eats the pea pods also immediately heals 30 Hit Points and can attempt a new saving throw against one poison or disease afflicting them.
