One of a set of four identical spears collectively known as the Four Claws of the Deepdread, this weapon is fashioned from a single seamless piece of matte-black metal with a razored silver edge. In bright light, it functions as a _+1 [[Striking]] [[Spear]]_, but in darkness or dim light, it becomes a _+2 greater striking spear_. You can upgrade its fundamental runes as normal for a specific weapon, starting from a _+2 greater striking spear_, but its fundamental runes are always one type worse in bright light.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command ; **Effect** You establish a telepathic link with someone else wielding a _deepdread claw_, enabling you to telepathically communicate with the creature while they possess the _deepdread claw_ regardless of distance, so long as you remain on the same plane. You can end a telepathic link you create or that you are part of as an action, which has the concentrate trait.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact ; **Effect** You cast 4th-level [[Darkness]]. You can see clearly in this darkness.
