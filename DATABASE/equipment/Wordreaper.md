The blade of this _+1 [[Sickle]]_ is engraved to look like the curving feather of a particularly elaborate quill. The wooden handle has a pen nib at the base. You can use the _wordreaper's_ handle as an ink pen and it never runs out of ink.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You use the _wordreaper_ to inscribe the words “read by” and your name inside a non-magical literary work (such as a non-magical book, scroll, or play). You immediately gain cursory knowledge of the literary work as though you had skimmed it for 5 minutes.
