These brilliant golden bracers feature a hammer motif as part of their engravings. While wearing them, your body surges with strength and you gain a +3 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] and [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]]. If you succeed, but not critically succeed, at your check to Disarm a creature, the effects of your check last until the start of your next turn, instead until the start of the target's turn. If you succeed at a check to Trip a creature, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage or 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a critical success. When you invest the bracers, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You reach for a foe and attempt to topple them with a powerful flip. Attempt an Athletics check to Trip a creature within reach. On a success, the creature is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] and takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage (double on a critical hit). If you knock the creature prone, it must also attempt a DC 35 Reflex save. On a failure, it drops any items it's holding.
