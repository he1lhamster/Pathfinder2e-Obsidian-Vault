Each of the legendary _orbs of dragonkind_ contains the essence and personality of a powerful dragon, with each of the 10 most famous orbs preserving a different type of metallic or chromatic dragon’s spirit. It is believed that orbs for other types of true dragons exist, though that theory is yet to be confirmed.
 While holding an _orb of dragonkind_, you are immune to the breath weapon of the dragon variety associated with the orb. An _orb of dragonkind_ also grants a number of additional senses. You can communicate verbally and visually with the bearers of other orbs as if you were in the same room with them. You know if there are any dragons within 10 miles of you at all times; this extends to 100 miles for dragons of the type associated with the orb. If an associated dragon is within 1 mile, you know which direction the dragon is from you and the dragon’s age, such as young, adult, or ancient. Each orb grants a 10th-level arcane innate spell that you can cast at will, determined by the specific orb.
The _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ can convey the innate spells of any of the other orbs, as well as their activated abilities, but it can grant each individual power only once per day. In addition, the bearer of the gold orb can use its 3-action activation to attempt to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] on the bearer of another orb if they are within 1 mile, as if that bearer were a dragon of the associated type within 500 feet. The last reports of the _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ on Golarion indicate the orb has been destroyed, however. GMs running campaigns in settings other than the Age of Lost Omens might decide the gold orb is still intact for their campaigns.
 Bearing an _orb of dragonkind_ earns you the enmity of all dragonkind forever because you profited from the enslavement of the dragon within the orb, even if you later lose the orb.
 **Spell Granted** (DC 40) black dragon ([[DATABASE/spell/Darkness|darkness]]), blue dragon ([[DATABASE/spell/Hallucinatory Terrain|hallucinatory terrain]]), brass dragon ([[DATABASE/spell/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]]), bronze dragon ([[DATABASE/spell/Control Water|control water]]), copper dragon ([[DATABASE/spell/Hideous Laughter|hideous laughter]]), green dragon ([[DATABASE/spell/Entangle|entangle]]), red dragon ([[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Fire|wall of fire]]), silver dragon ([[DATABASE/spell/Detect Alignment|detect alignment [evil only])]], white dragon ([[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Ice|wall of ice]])
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You cast a 10th-level _dominate_ spell (DC 40) on a dragon of the type associated with the orb within 500 feet, except the effect lasts for 1 month rather than unlimited. The dragon does not receive its status bonus to saving throws against magic. The dragon is then temporarily immune to further domination via the orb for 24 hours.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** You breathe an elemental blast that deals 25d6 damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save) in either a 60-foot cone or a 100-foot line (your choice). The breath’s damage type matches the Breath Weapon of the dragon type associated with the _orb of dragonkind_ (acid for the black orb, electricity for the blue orb, and so on).
**Destruction** An _orb of dragonkind_ violently shatters and explodes when exposed to the Breath Weapon of a dragon who is a descendant of the dragon trapped within. The explosion deals damage as the 2-action activation above to all creatures within 90 feet.

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
Each of the legendary _Orbs of Dragonkind_ contains the essence and personality of a powerful dragon. The _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ was the most powerful of them all, until it was shattered by Mengkare’s draconic breath. Reconstructed at great expense by enslaved spellcasters toiling under the Scarlet Triad’s watch, the _Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ is a shadow of its prior self, yet it remains a potent weapon against dragons of all types.
 While carried, the _Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ grants its owner resistance 30 to the Breath Weapons of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Metallic|gold dragons]]. The owner also can sense if there are any dragons within 10 miles, or any gold dragons within 100 miles. When within 1 mile of a dragon, they can determine the direction to the dragon and the dragon’s age category (such as young, ancient, or wyrm).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** Three times per day; **Effect** You attempt to overwhelm a dragon’s mind—while you cannot control the dragon, you can render it immobile for a short time. Choose a dragon within 60 feet; the dragon can attempt to resist the orb with a DC 30 Will saving throw (or higher with _orb shards_). Gold dragons take a –4 circumstance penalty to this saving throw. Any stun from this activation ends if the dragon is attacked or otherwise subject to a hostile act other than that of the orb.
**Critical Success** The dragon is unaffected.
**Success** The dragon is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 3]].
**Failure** The dragon is stunned for as long as the orb’s wielder [[DATABASE/action/Sustain an Activation|Sustains the Activation]].
**Critical Failure** As failure, but hostile actions don’t end the dragon’s stun.
**Destruction** The _Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ is resilient, but its imperfect nature leaves it vulnerable. It can be damaged or even destroyed by mundane attacks (Hardness 40, HP 200, BT 100). It has weakness 30 to the Breath Weapons and Strikes of gold dragons.

## Orb Shard<span class="item-type">Item 20</span>

**Usage** held in 1 hand
A shard of the _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ resembles a pointed length of crystal about the size and shape of a shortsword without a hilt. It functions as a _+3 striking shortsword_ that deals 2d6 extra damage to dragons.
 Each _orb shard_ within 60 feet of the _flawed orb of Gold Dragonkind_ increases the save DC against the orb by 1; thus, if all 13 remaining _orb shards_ are in this area, the save DC against the flawed orb increases from DC 30 to DC 43. A talented spellcaster or crafter can integrate an _orb shard_ back into the flawed orb to make this DC increase permanent.
**Destruction** An _orb shard_ is extraordinarily resilient, but it can be damaged or even destroyed by mundane attacks (Hardness 40, HP 50, BT 25). It has weakness 30 to the Breath Weapons and Strikes of gold dragons.
