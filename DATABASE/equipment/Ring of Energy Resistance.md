This ring grants you resistance 5 against one type of energy damage: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each ring is crafted to protect against a particular type of energy damage, and its design usually embodies the type of energy it protects the wearer from in some way. For instance, a _ring of fire resistance_ might be capped with a ruby, whereas a _ring of cold resistance_ features a sapphire instead.
