Built from the spiked tail of a [[DATABASE/monster/Manticore|manticore]], a _spike launcher_ is designed to launch large, spear-like projectiles. A spike launcher is a _+1 striking weapon_. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d8 piercing damage. It has the backstabber, fatal aim d12, and kickback traits with a range increment of 120 feet and reload 2. It uses the critical specialization of the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Bow|bow]] weapon group, rather than the firearm critical specialization.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact (evocation, magical) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** The _spike launcher_ is loaded; **Effect** The _spike launcher_ fires a volley of smaller spikes in a 10-foot burst centered anywhere within its range. Make a Strike with the _spike launcher_ against each creature in the area. On a success, the spike causes the creature to take a –5-foot status penalty to their Speed. On a critical success, the creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] instead. In either case, the creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an Interact action to remove the spike and end the penalty or immobilized condition.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the tail of a manticore.
