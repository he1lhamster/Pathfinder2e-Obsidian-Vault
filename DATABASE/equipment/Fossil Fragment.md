A fossil fragment is a piece of a fossil creature, typically a smaller bone from a larger specimen.
**Activate****—Fossile Metamorphosis** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate); **Effect** You activate the fragment by placing it on solid ground and then speaking its name, causing the fragment to form the full fossilized skeleton of a creature. In creature form, the fragment has the minion trait. Because it's an animated fossil instead of a living creature, it has the construct and earth traits and lacks its normal creature type trait (typically animal). It's also immune to bleed, death effects, disease, [[Doomed]], [[Drained]], [[Fatigued]], healing, nonlethal attacks, [[Paralyzed]], poison, [[Sickened]], vitality, void, and [[Unconscious]]. It can understand your language, and it obeys you to the best of its ability when you use an action to command it. The specifics of each creature, as well as the activation's frequency, if any, appear in its entry below.
 If the fragment is slain while in creature form, it reverts to its fragment shape and can't be activated again for 1 week. If the fragment is destroyed, its magic is lost.

## Fossil Fragment (Amber Mosquito)<span class="item-type">Item 13</span>

**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Price** 2,500 gp
**Bulk** L
A minuscule insect preserved in fossilized tree sap, this fragment becomes a [[Giant Mosquito]] when activated. It can be called upon once per day for up to 10 minutes. The fossil mosquito can't afflict anyone with septic malaria. If the mosquito uses Blood Drain, it doesn't gain temporary Hit Points, but instead collects blood from the victim. The blood stays within the mosquito indefinitely and stays fresh while it does. If the mosquito uses Blood Drain again, any blood from before that use is lost.

## Fossil Fragment (Brontosaurus Phalange)<span class="item-type">Item 18</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Price** 21,000 gp
**Bulk** L
This massive toe bone becomes a [[Brontosaurus]] when activated. It can be called upon no more than four times per month. The skeleton remains for 24 hours if used as a beast of burden or for transport. If it attempts an attack or otherwise engage in combat, it reverts to its fragment form after 1d4 rounds. The skeleton is so massive and sturdy that it can serve as the base of a structure (from an item or spell effect with the structure trait), provided the structure is no larger than 20 feet in width or height. When the brontosaurus reverts to its fragment form, the structure reverts with it.

## Fossil Fragment (Deinonychus Claw)<span class="item-type">Item 7</span>

**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Price** 360 gp
**Bulk** L
This curved claw becomes a [[Deinonychus]] when activated. It can be called upon once per day and can remain in deinonychus form for no more than 10 minutes. The skeleton can serve as a mount for a creature one size smaller than it or smaller.

## Fossil Fragment (Eurypterid Paddle)<span class="item-type">Item 12</span>

**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Price** 1,700 gp
**Bulk** L
The tip of an oar-like limb specialized for swimming becomes a [[Spiny Eurypterid]] when activated. It can be called upon once a week for up to 24 hours. The eurypterid can serve as a mount for a creature one size smaller than it or smaller, and when it does, it confers the ability to breathe both air and water upon its rider.

## Fossil Fragment (Petrified Wood)<span class="item-type">Item 14</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Price** 4,200 gp
**Bulk** L
This colorful sliver of petrified wood becomes an [[Awakened Tree]] when activated. It doesn't have the normal weaknesses of an awakened tree, but it's rooted in place, [[Immobilized]]. As a single action, it can throw a petrified seed, such as a stone pine cone or acorn, up to 60 feet. A copy of the tree appears there, provided there's an unoccupied space large enough for it. While two trees exist, if either tree throws another seed, one of the existing trees disappears, replaced by the new tree. The tree can be called upon once per day for up to 1 minute. This duration starts when you activate the item, and all trees disappear when it ends.

## Fossil Fragment (Triceratops Frill)<span class="item-type">Item 15</span>

**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Price** 6,000 gp
**Bulk** L
This small piece of triceratops frill turns into a [[Triceratops]] when activated. It can be called upon once per day and can remain in triceratops form for no more than 10 minutes. The skeleton can serve as a mount for a creature one size smaller than it or smaller.

**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Price** 14,000 gp
