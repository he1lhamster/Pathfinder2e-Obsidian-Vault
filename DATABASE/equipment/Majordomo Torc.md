Forged in platinum, a _majordomo torc_ is engraved with heraldic insignias along with one language's alphabet, much like a [[Choker of Elocution]]. You gain a +1 item bonus to [[Society]] checks and the ability to understand, speak, and write the torc's language. Your excellent elocution reduces the DC of the flat check to perform an auditory action while [[Deafened]] from 5 to 3.
 Upon being invested, the torc appoints itself your majordomo and, given the chance, takes over coordinating your social calendar, engagements, and wardrobe. A _majordomo torc_ has a prim, fussy disposition, and although it defers to you, it can grow sardonic if you frequently ignore its advice. The torc has the following activation.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The _majordomo torc_ casts [[Befitting Attire]] on you, usually to your specifications. However the torc can also choose the appearance of the illusion for you.
