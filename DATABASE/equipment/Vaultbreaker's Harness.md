A _vaultbreaker's harness_ has four pockets across the chest. The pockets contain a set of [[Thieves' Tools]], infiltrator picks, a [[Crowbar]], and a [[Glass Cutter]]. These items are magically bound to the harness; if they are more than 1 foot away from you, they disappear, then reappear in the harness at the next sunset. [[Broken]] or destroyed items similarly reappear, restored, in their proper pockets at sunset.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You cinch the harness to prepare for mischief. You gain a +1 item bonus to [[Stealth]] checks and a +10-foot item bonus to your Speed for 1 minute.
