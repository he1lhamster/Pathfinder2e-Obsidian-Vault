The blade of this _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy|holy]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Glaive|glaive]]_ shimmers with a prismatic sheen, as if faintly reflecting a rainbow. A _songbird's brush_ sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 40 feet). When wielded in combat, the sound of the blade cutting through the air creates a soft, musical trill as if produced by a songbird. Sacred to the faithful of [[DATABASE/deity/Shelyn|Shelyn]], a _songbird's brush_ is so named for the fighting style developed by worshippers of the Eternal Rose, which equates its sweeping swings to painting with a brush. A songbird's brush grants a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks made to dance or sing as long as the glaive is held in two hands.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You sweep the _songbird's brush_ in an arc before you, casting [[DATABASE/spell/Prismatic Spray|prismatic spray]] from the glaive. The spell DC is 34. This _prismatic spray_ does not affect good-aligned creatures in its area.
**Craft Requirements** You are a worshipper of Shelyn.
