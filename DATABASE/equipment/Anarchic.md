An _anarchic_ rune is jagged and asymmetrical, channeling chaotic energy. A weapon with this rune deals an additional 1d6 chaotic damage against lawful targets. If you are lawful, you are enfeebled 2 while carrying or wielding this weapon.
 When you critically succeed at a Strike with this weapon against a lawful creature, roll 1d6. On a 1 or 2, you deal double minimum damage; on a 3 or 4, double your damage normally; on a 5 or 6, you deal double maximum damage. 
**Craft Requirements** You are chaotic.
