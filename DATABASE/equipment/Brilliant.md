This rune causes a weapon to transform into pure, brilliant energy. The weapon deals an additional 1d4 fire damage on a successful Strike, as well as 1d4 good damage to fiends and 1d4 positive damage to undead. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command (light) ; **Effect** You plunge your weapon into darkness to return the light. Attempt a counteract check with a counteract level of 5 and a +19 counteract modifier to end a magical darkness effect whose area is within reach of the weapon.
