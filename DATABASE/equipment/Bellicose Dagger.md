The hilt of a _bellicose dagger_ is etched with the word for “war” in various languages. Having absorbed the spirit of violence over the course of its existence, the weapon now craves bloodshed. A _bellicose dagger_ is a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Wounding|wounding]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_. However, anytime you interact with creatures, no matter the context, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or else find you have, as a reaction, drawn the dagger.
 When you use the _bellicose dagger_ as a weapon for the first time, it fuses to you. While it's in your possession, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks and skill checks to avoid fighting, such as [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to trick your way out of a scuffle or [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to sneak past enemies.
