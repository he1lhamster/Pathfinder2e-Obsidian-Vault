The origins of the _watch of lost ages_, a silver pocket watch, are enigmatic. Its construction matches no known culture, and its appearance shifts back and forth from battered and tarnished to shiny and new without cause or apparent reason. The watch exudes a sense of melancholy and loss, and anyone holding it is acutely aware of the impermanence of all things and the march of time, moving ever forward. This relic might show up in a mysterious ruin or spontaneously appear in a spellcaster's hand after they cast a time spell. The relic grants you a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about historical subjects.
