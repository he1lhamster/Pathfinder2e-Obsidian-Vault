The golden religious symbol on the top of this spherical incense holder shifts its form to match the faith of its bearer. You gain no benefit from a _judgment thurible_ if you don't worship a deity or if your deity is true neutral. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 27.

* **Armor** After you cast a spell by activating the thurible, the thurible casts [[Circle of Protection]] on you, with a duration of 1 round. You choose the alignment, which must be one opposed by one of your deity's alignments.
* **Weapon** After you cast a spell by activating the thurible, the weapon gains your choice of an [[Anarchic]], [[Axiomatic]], [[Holy]], or [[Unholy]] rune until the end of your next turn. You can choose a rune only if it matches an alignment your deity has (_anarchic_ for chaotic, _axiomatic_ for lawful, _holy_ for good, or _unholy_ for evil).
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You cast [[Divine Lance]].
