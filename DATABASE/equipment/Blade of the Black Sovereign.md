This _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Shock|shock]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Greatsword|greatsword]]_ is forged from [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Weapon|standard-grade adamantine]], with inlays of broken circuitry and a robot's ocular lens on the cross guard. A soft thrum comes from the blade, which you feel as a subtle pulse through the grip when wielding it. It sparks when unsheathed, emitting dim light within 5 feet. On a hit against a foe made of metal, wearing metal armor, or using a metal shield, if the foe takes electricity damage from the blade, the makes the foe [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] for 1 round; if the Strike was a critical hit, it also makes them [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] for 1 round.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact ; **Effect** You cast the [[DATABASE/spell/Electric Arc|electric arc]] cantrip from the sword as an 8th-level primal spell, using 10 + your melee attack modifier with the _Blade of the Black Sovereign_ as your spell DC.
