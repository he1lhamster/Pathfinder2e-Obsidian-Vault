This _+2 [[Striking]] [[Shock]] [[Greatsword]]_ is forged from [[Adamantine Weapon]], with inlays of broken circuitry and a robot's ocular lens on the cross guard. A soft thrum comes from the blade, which you feel as a subtle pulse through the grip when wielding it. It sparks when unsheathed, emitting dim light within 5 feet. On a hit against a foe made of metal, wearing metal armor, or using a metal shield, if the foe takes electricity damage from the blade, the makes the foe [[Flat-Footed]] for 1 round; if the Strike was a critical hit, it also makes them [[Clumsy]] for 1 round.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact ; **Effect** You cast the [[Electric Arc]] cantrip from the sword as an 8th-level primal spell, using 10 + your melee attack modifier with the _Blade of the Black Sovereign_ as your spell DC.
