These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious metal and enchanted to unlock that metal's true potential. Each version has a different special effect.

## Awakened Metal Shot (Awakened Adamantine Shot)<span class="item-type">Item 18</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
**Price** 3,500 gp
The shot is a high-grade [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine|adamantine]] bullet. The awakened adamantine breaks through any resistance. The shot ignores the first 20 resistance a creature has to physical damage, all damage, or piercing or bludgeoning damage. Against a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Golem|golem]] or creature who already has a resistance bypassed by adamantine, or a weakness to adamantine, the shot shatters the target's defenses, causing them to become [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] for 1 minute instead. Because adamantine is uncommon, this version of _awakened metal shot_ is uncommon even for gunslingers or other characters with access to uncommon guns and bullets from this book.

## Awakened Metal Shot (Awakened Cold Iron Shot)<span class="item-type">Item 17</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
**Price** 2,300 gp
The shot is a high-grade [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron|cold iron]] bullet. The awakened cold iron attempts to disrupt enchantments the target placed on others' minds. You can name a creature you believe to be enchanted by your target or allow the shot to choose an enchanted creature randomly. On a hit, the shot attempts to counteract the enchantment the target is using to manipulate that creature's mind. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demon]] or fey, you get a success instead. If you hit a demon or fey with no active enchantment effects on other creatures, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 minute instead.

## Awakened Metal Shot (Awakened Silver Shot)<span class="item-type">Item 17</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
**Price** 2,300 gp
The shot is a high-grade [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver|silver]] bullet. The awakened silver gleams with altered celestial moonlight designed to weaken and expose [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|devils]] and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Werecreature|werecreatures]]. On a hit, it attempts to counteract any polymorph effect on the target. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a devil or a werecreature, you get a success instead. If you counteracted the [[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]] ability, the creature can't use that ability again for 1 round, or 1 minute on a critical success. If you hit a devil or werecreature not under a polymorph effect, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute instead.
