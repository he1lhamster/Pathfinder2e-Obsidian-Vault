Tradition says the _dragonfly fulu_ should be affixed to the upper back, like the wings of an insect. When you Activate this fulu, you gain a +2 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[DATABASE/action/Long Jump|Long Jump]] for 1 minute. During this time, you can attempt an Athletics check to High Jump or Long Jump as a single action without the Stride requirement. You can also High Jump or Long Jump from a nonsolid substance, such as air or water, but if you use this power of the fulu, its effects ends after you jump.
