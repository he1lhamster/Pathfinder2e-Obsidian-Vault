Blood offered from a willing donor was taken directly from the vein and stored in an ornate vial that keeps it as pure and red as the day it was extracted. When this catalyst is added to a [[Vampiric Touch]] spell of up to 4th level, instead of gaining temporary Hit Points based on the damage dealt, you recover half of the damage dealt as Hit Points.

## Unsullied Blood (Lesser)<span class="item-type">Item 5</span>

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Price** 30 gp
**Bulk** L

## Unsullied Blood (Moderate)<span class="item-type">Item 8</span>

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Price** 85 gp
**Bulk** L
You can add the catalyst to a _vampiric touch_ spell up to 5th level. In addition to the effects of _lesser unsullied blood_, if the amount of Hit Points that would be restored by the spell exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you gain the excess as temporary Hit Points.

## Unsullied Blood (Greater)<span class="item-type">Item 10</span>

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Price** 200 gp
**Bulk** L
As moderate, except you can add the catalyst to a _vampiric touch_ or [[Vampiric Maiden]] spell of up to 6th level.

## Unsullied Blood (Major)<span class="item-type">Item 14</span>

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
