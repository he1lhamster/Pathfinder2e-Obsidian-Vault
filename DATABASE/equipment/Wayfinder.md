This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called [[DATABASE/equipment/Aeon Stone|aeon stones]]. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A _wayfinder_ functions as a compass.
 An indentation in the middle of the _wayfinder_ can hold a single _aeon stone_. Placing an _aeon stone_ in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the _aeon stone_ orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a _wayfinder_ and the _aeon stone_ within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested _aeon stone_ slotted in a _wayfinder_ also grants its resonant power.
 If you have more than one _wayfinder_ with an invested _aeon stone_ on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional _aeon stones_ orbiting your head, just not in _wayfinders_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command ; **Effect** The _wayfinder_ is targeted by a 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Light|light]] spell.

## Archaic Wayfinder<span class="item-type">Item 2</span>

PFS Note_ All characters have access to the archaic wayfinder _
**Price** 30 gp
**Usage** held in 1 hand
**Activate** Cast a Spell 
An _archaic wayfinder_ functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an _archaic wayfinder_, a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction. Activating an _archaic wayfinder_ is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An _archaic wayfinder_ can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An _archaic wayfinder_ counts against the limit of one _wayfinder_ with a slotted resonant _[[DATABASE/equipment/Aeon Stone|aeon stone]]_.

**Price** 80 gp
**Usage** worn
As a standard _wayfinder_, but once per day you can activate it to cast _[[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]]_ on a creature other than yourself, using either the one-action or two-action version of _[[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]]_ as a 1st-level spell.

**Price** 200 gp
**Usage** worn
**Access** A character who is a member of the Pathfinder Society has access to this option.
A _bi-resonant wayfinder_ is inlaid with intricate platinum wires in a complex array of conduits for magical energy. These conduits control the resonant interference of _aeon stones_. A _bi-resonant wayfinder_ works just like a regular _wayfinder_ except it has two _aeon stone_ slots, and the _aeon stones_ in both slots grant their resonant powers without interfering with each other. The _bi-resonant wayfinder_ and the two _aeon stones_ count as two items toward your investiture limit.

A _shining wayfinder_ is a polished silver compass blessed by the power of benevolent deities. It has the usual functions of a _wayfinder_, except instead of an activation to cast _light_, the shining wayfinder has the following two activations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact ; **Effect** You hold the _wayfinder_ and ask for guidance. The wayfinder casts [[DATABASE/spell/Guidance|guidance]] on you.

**Price** 200 gp
**Usage** worn
**Access** Member of the Pathfinder Society.
_Chronicler wayfinders_ bear a mystical connection to the _Pathfinder Chronicles_ themselves, granting them the ability to assist in situations where unusual lore is needed by drawing on lore from a particular topic. Each _chronicler wayfinder_ is attuned to a specific [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill, chosen at the time of creation. In addition to the effects of a _wayfinder_, a chronicler wayfinder has the following activation.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision ; **Effect** You tap into the _Pathfinder Chronicles_ on the _chronicler wayfinder's_ attuned topic, gaining the effects of a [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] action with the chosen Lore skill. For the Lore check's modifier, use whichever is better of +12 or your own modifier, using your level as your proficiency bonus even if you're untrained in the attuned Lore skill.

**Price** 900 gp
**Usage** worn
Worn on a chain around the neck, a _Razmiri wayfinder_ functions as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Compass|compass]] and provides its wearer a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]] or [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]]. _Razmiri wayfinders_ can also be used to grant temporary healing, making it easier for the wearer to impersonate a divine spellcaster.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** You touch an adjacent creature, granting them 3d8 temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> manipulate **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You touch an adjacent creature and attempt a counteract check against one poison or disease afflicting the creature. On a success, you halt the effects of the poison or disease for 1 day, rather than removing it. This temporarily relieves any penalties imposed by the affliction but doesn't cure the effect or count against its duration; the poison or disease is merely halted for a time, and it resumes where it left off once this effect ends.
