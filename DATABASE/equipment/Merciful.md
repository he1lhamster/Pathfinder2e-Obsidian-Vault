_Merciful_ weapons are sheathed in an unmistakable wispy green aura recognized by both gladiators and guards around the world. A merciful weapon has the nonlethal trait and can't be used to make a lethal attack. Any [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]] the weapon would deal is negated.
 On a critical hit, a _merciful_ weapon causes the target to become [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] with the weapon's wielder for 1 minute, as the target is bombarded with feelings of guilt and remorse. This is a mental effect. If you have access to the weapon's critical specialization effect, you choose whether to use it or the merciful effect.
