You've bargained with an imp, one of the least powerful devils, for a fragment of infernal luck. 
**Benefit** Once per day, you can roll a saving throw twice and use the higher result. 
**Payment** At the termination of your mortal life, your soul must serve the imp for 100 years. 
**Hidden Condition** The “termination of mortal life” clause is carefully worded to hasten your demise. You can't use the benefit against a death effect, and if you roll a failure on a saving throw against a death effect, you get a critical failure instead. 
**Termination Clause** If you critically fail a saving throw against a death effect and do not die, the contract becomes unenforceable on its terms and is voided.
