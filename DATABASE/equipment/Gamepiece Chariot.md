This stone figurine of a chariot pulled by two horses was used by Tekritanin adults during strategy game competitions. Sometimes, though, mischievous adolescents snatched pieces like this one for joyriding.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You place the figurine on the ground and roll it forward. As the chariot begins to move, it rapidly expands to the size of a Large [[DATABASE/vehicle/Heavy Chariot|heavy chariot]] pulled by two animated stone [[DATABASE/monster/War Horse|war horses]]. You can board the chariot and drive it up to 80 feet in a straight line. You can move through spaces occupied by creatures of size Medium or smaller, dealing 4d8+10 bludgeoning damage to those creatures. Affected creatures must attempt a DC 28 basic Reflex save; on a failure, a creature is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. The chariot returns to its figurine form once it stops moving.
