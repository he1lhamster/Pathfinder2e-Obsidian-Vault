Every part of this dark, shining guitar, from the strings to the soundboard, is constructed of metal. When the strings are strummed, the gilding on the guitar ripples like a liquid. A _resonant guitar_ is a [[DATABASE/equipment/Musical Instrument|virtuoso handheld musical instrument]] that grants a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks attempted while using it.
 A _resonant guitar_ is a planar key for [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|interplanar teleport]] and similar magic to travel to the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Metal|Plane of Metal]]. When using it in this way, you can play a tune inspired by your destination to make it more likely to arrive where you intend to be, appearing 1d6×25 miles from your intended destination instead of 1d10×25 miles away.
**Activate****—Strum of Thunder** 1 minute (manipulate); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You play a magnetic tune, enchanting one metallic weapon within 60 feet of you. This item gains the [[DATABASE/equipment/Thundering|thundering]] rune for 1 hour.
**Activate****—Chord of Protection** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (manipulate); **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of you targets you or an ally with a melee attack; **Effect** You strike a piercing chord, putting up an invisible sound barrier between the target and the attacker. The target gains a +2 status bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the Strike still hits, the barrier breaks, dealing 3d10 sonic damage to the attacker.
