This black _+2 [[Striking]] [[Scimitar]]_ reflects light only along its edge, like a thin crescent moon. It grants a +1 item bonus to [[Stealth]] while you're holding it, increasing to a +2 item bonus if it has a [[Weapon Potency]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Attempt a melee Strike with the _gloaming arc_. On a hit, you slice away the target's shadow from its body and it must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[Enfeebled]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and [[Drained]]. The target doesn't cast a shadow until it is no longer drained.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but drained 2.
