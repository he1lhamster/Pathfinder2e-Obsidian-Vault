This _+1 striking [[Bo Staff]]_ is particularly long, making it useful as a balancing pole. While you wield it, the acrobat’s staff releases chalk dust to make your grip more secure, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC against checks to [[Disarm]] you of it.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Trigger** You fail or critically fail an [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Balance]] and would fall; **Effect** Reroll the Acrobatics check and take the better result.
