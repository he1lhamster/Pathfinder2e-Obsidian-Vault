Elegant silver filigree contains the body of this ephemeral item, which is made of solid light. Its shape resembles a pistol, and it's often carried by hunters of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Werecreature|werecreatures]], [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire|vampires]], and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|devils]]. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun emits a silvery ray of pure moonlight that deals fire damage depending on its type. The spellgun's damage is treated as [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|silver]] for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.
**Critical Success** The target takes double damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the start of your next turn. If it has a weakness to silver or a resistance that can be bypassed by silver, it's also enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
**Success** The target takes full damage and is dazzled until the start of your next turn.
