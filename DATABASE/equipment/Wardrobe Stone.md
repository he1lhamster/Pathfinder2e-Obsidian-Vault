This large stone eye is the size of a fist and decorated with elaborate carvings of robes and other garments.
**Activate** (1 minute) envision, Interact ; **Effect** You enter a brief trance in which you envision yourself entering a large dressing room. You maneuver through the endless dressing-room mindscape and search for whatever articles of clothing, accessories, and other garments you desire. After the activation, you gain the effects of [[Illusory Disguise]], except that it only causes you to appear to be wearing the exact outfit you selected within the mindscape. The illusion also disguises the _wardrobe stone_ to match your outfit and not appear out of place, such as by appearing to be a glove or bracelet, though it continues to occupy your hand while you're under the effects of _illusory disguise_. You can actively Dismiss the Spell, but the effects are also dismissed immediately when you're no longer holding the _wardrobe stone_.
