The head of this bolt is a vented container that smells strongly of caustic pepper. When an activated _blindpepper bolt_ hits a target, it deals no damage; instead the creature must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. If the Strike was a critical success, the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude save. At the GM's discretion, a creature with no eyes or olfactory organs might not be affected by this item.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the end of your next turn. It can end the effect early if it spends an action, which has the manipulate trait, to wipe down its eyes.
**Failure** The target is dazzled for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] until the end of your next turn and dazzled for 1 minute.
