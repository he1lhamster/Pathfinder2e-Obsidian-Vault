When you drink the thick, slate-colored _immovable potion_, you become anchored in place, even defying gravity, rendering you [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] for 1 minute or until you Dismiss the activation. While you are immobilized this way, the DC to move you from your place, including knocking you [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]], is 40.
