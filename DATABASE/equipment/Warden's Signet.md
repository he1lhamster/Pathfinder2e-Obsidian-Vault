This symbol shows your dedication to the magic practiced by some [[DATABASE/class_/Ranger|rangers]]. Most rangers wear it on an amulet, ring, or piercing. You gain a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast a ranger warden spell. When you use this Focus Point, the _warden's signet_ also casts a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Barkskin|barkskin]] spell on you. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.
**Craft Requirements** You are a ranger with at least one warden spell.
