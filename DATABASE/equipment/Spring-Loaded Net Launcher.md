This small bronze cylinder is about the size of a potion bottle. When you activate the launcher, it fires an unattached [[DATABASE/equipment/Net|net]] requiring only a single hand, and at a greater distance. As normal, you make a ranged attack roll against a Medium or smaller creature, but you can target a creature up to 60 feet away, instead of only 20 feet away. The net trap otherwise functions as an unattached net.
