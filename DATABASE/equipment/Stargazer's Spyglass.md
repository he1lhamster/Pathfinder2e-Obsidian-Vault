This ornate [[DATABASE/equipment/Spyglass|spyglass]] has a brass tube inscribed with constellations and green-tinted lens. It's often used by field astronomers to pick out greater details among stars and other celestial bodies. Like a typical spyglass, you can see eight times farther while looking through a _stargazer's spyglass_.
