This leather sheath is large enough to hold an item of up to light Bulk and is typically used for [[Dagger]], wands, [[Thieves' Tools]], and similar objects. You can affix it to the inside of a boot, under a bracer or sleeve, or in other inconspicuous locations to gain a +1 item bonus to [[Stealth]] checks and DCs to hide or conceal the item within.
