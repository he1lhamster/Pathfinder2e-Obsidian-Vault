An eyecatcher is a simple tassel, reflective basket hilt, or other accessory attached to a weapon to serve as a distraction. You gain a +1 item bonus to [[Deception]] checks to [[Feint]] while using a weapon with an eyecatcher attached. An eyecatcher affects the balancing of a weapon, making it slightly more unwieldy. This increases the weapon's Bulk by 1 and grants a –1 penalty to damage rolls with the weapon.
