This tingly solution increases the elasticity and contraction of your leg muscles. For 1 minute after drinking this elixir, you can [[DATABASE/action/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[DATABASE/action/Long Jump|Long Jump]] as a single action instead of 2 actions. If you do, you don’t perform the initial [[DATABASE/action/Stride|Stride]] (nor do you fail if you don’t Stride 10 feet).
