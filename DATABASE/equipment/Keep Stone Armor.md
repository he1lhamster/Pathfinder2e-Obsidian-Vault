**Source** [[Highhelm]]
**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor

---
Keep stone armor is nearly impossible to acquire due to the fact that most of Highhelm's keep stone reserves are intended to help complete the Torag's Shield project. Additionally, the sheer amount of keep stone required to craft a suit of keep stone armor is prohibitive. For those who can acquire a set, there are few better protections against magic. While wearing keep stone armor, the item bonus it provides to AC and saving throws increases by 1 against spells, and divination spells targeting you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or fail.
