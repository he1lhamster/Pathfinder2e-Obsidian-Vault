A phantom roll contains vegetables, greens, and fine, clear noodles, all wrapped in transparent, edible starch paper and alchemically treated and laced with a tangy sauce. Upon eating the roll, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks you attempt during the [[DATABASE/action/Avoid Notice|Avoid Notice]] exploration activity. You can also Avoid Notice at full Speed or combine it with [[DATABASE/action/Investigate|Investigate]] or [[DATABASE/action/Scout|Scout]] while moving at half Speed. These effects expire 24 hours after you eat the roll or when you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
