This multicolored skein is twisted together from strands of many different materials. When used to stitch together pieces from the carcasses of two or more animals, it fuses them into a single intact carcass of an outlandish-looking monster with characteristics of the component species. The thread disappears, leaving no obvious seams and smoothing the transition between the parts of the creatures.
