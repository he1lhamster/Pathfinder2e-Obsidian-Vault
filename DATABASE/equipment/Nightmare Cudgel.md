Crafted from polished wood, this seemingly mundane _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Club|club]]_ comes with a red leather strap near the handle. The mere sight of the cudgel in a guard's hand fills prisoners with dread. Good creatures are [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] while carrying, wielding, or wearing this item crafted by the sea-witches.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact (emotion, mental) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You initiate an intimidating walk, thumping the cudgel menacingly against your palm. As part of activating this item, you can Stride twice. For the next minute, whenever you successfully Strike a creature with the _nightmare cudgel_, you can use a free action to attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the struck creature.
