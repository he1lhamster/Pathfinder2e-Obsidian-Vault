This apparatus increases the viscosity of the reagents in alchemical bombs, to deadly effect. As a 10-minute activity that has the manipulate trait, you can use a bomb coagulant alembic to distill the contents of one alchemical bomb that deals splash damage into a stickier substance. After distilling, the bomb deals no splash damage but instead deals [[Persistent Damage]] equal to and of the same type as its original splash damage. If the bomb already deals persistent damage, distilling increases that damage by the bomb's original splash damage.
