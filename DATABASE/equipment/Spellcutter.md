The blade of this _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Weapon|adamantine]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_ seems to absorb light from the air around it, giving the impression the wielder is standing in the shadow of a much larger creature. While _Spellcutter_ is a potent weapon for battling undead and constructs, an ancient restriction on the blade prevents it from harming living creatures; attacks against living beings deal no damage. This restriction doesn't apply to [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dhampir|dhampirs]] or creatures with the [[DATABASE/monsterability/Negative Healing|negative healing]] ability who are otherwise living; the magic of the blade can't distinguish between such beings and undead.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** You're targeted by a spell while wielding _Spellcutter_; **Effect** _Spellcutter_ attempts to absorb the magic of the triggering spell, giving you a +4 status bonus to your AC and saves against the effect.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** Touching _Spellcutter_ to any light source of 12th level or lower (including 6th-level spells with the light trait) instantly extinguishes the effect. If the source of the light is a large flame, such as a forest fire or bonfire, it only extinguishes the light source in a 5-foot radius burst from the point of contact.
