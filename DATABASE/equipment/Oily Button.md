A thin sheen of slick oil covers this gaudy button. When you activate the _oily button_, your attempts to [[Disarm]] your opponent of an item before the start of the opponent's next turn gain a +4 circumstance bonus instead of +2, and the –2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item lasts until the end of its next turn or until it uses an Interact action to adjust its grip.
