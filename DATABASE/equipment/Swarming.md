Able to copy itself many times over when thrown until the air is filled with deadly blades, a swarming weapon turns a single weapon into a shower of devastation.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You fling your weapon and it multiplies as it flies through the air, filling a 30-foot cone. All creatures within the area take damage equal to double the weapon's number of damage dice, with a DC 27 basic Reflex save.
