[[Goblin]] [[Wizard]] invented the amazing pop-up book to store their spells without written words, though the tradition has been spreading to illusionists from other cultures. These grimoires have colorful covers and open to reveal three-dimensional scenes illustrating various spells. Goblins delight in constructing the books just right so a terrifying creature, like a horse or dog, pops up toward the reader each time a page is turned.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision (metamagic) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** If your next action is to cast an illusion spell prepared from this grimoire that creates illusory terrain or creatures, such as [[Hallucinatory Terrain]], you draw forth the pop-up scene. If a creature succeeds, but doesn't critically succeed, at a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion, then just as their mind recognizes the illusion, a startling—though obviously false—illusion pops up somewhere unexpected in their field of vision, visible to only them, dealing mental damage equal to the spell's level.
