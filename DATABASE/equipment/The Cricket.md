_The Cricket_ represents speed and quick passage. As long as _The Cricket_ is invested, it grants you a +10-foot item bonus to all your Speeds. This increases to a +20-foot item bonus if you are at least 19th level or higher.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Your feet begin to glow and shimmer as if they were vibrating. Stride up to three times your Speed. You can [[DATABASE/action/Burrow|Burrow]], [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]], or [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]] instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type. This movement doesn't trigger reactions and you can move through creatures' spaces as if they weren't there during this movement.
