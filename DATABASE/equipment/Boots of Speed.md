These sleek red boots make your legs feel like they’re bursting with energy. You gain a +5-foot item bonus to your land Speed and to any climb or swim Speeds you have.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You click the heels of the boots together and gain the quickened condition for 1 minute. You can use the extra action to Stride, Climb, or Swim. (You must still attempt an Athletics check for the Climb and Swim actions unless you have the appropriate movement type.)
