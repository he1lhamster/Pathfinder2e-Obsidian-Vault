This fleshy _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Whip|whip]]_ is obviously crafted from the tentacle of some fearsome beast, likely an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Alghollthu|alghollthu]], and constantly drips slime.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command, **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The next creature you successfully Strike with this weapon is exposed to _alghollthu slime_.
 **Alghollthu Slime** (curse, occult) **Saving Throw** DC 25 Fortitude; **Stage 1** no ill effect (1 round); **Stage 2** the victim's skin softens, making the creature [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] (1 round); **Stage 3** the victim's skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane, making it drained 2 until the curse ends; every hour this membrane remains dry, the creature's drained condition increases by 1 (permanent). A [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Disease|remove disease]] spell can counteract this curse, but immunity to disease offers no protection against it.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include a tentacle from an alghollthu.
