This potion's bottle glows softly with shimmering silver light. Upon drinking this potion, you're surrounded by a nimbus of blazing starlight that lasts for 1 minute. You emanate a field of bright light with a 20-foot radius (and dim light for another 20 feet, like a [[DATABASE/equipment/Torch|torch]]). You take a –20 penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks. Any creature that targets you with an attack or an ability must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round. A creature who succeeds at this save is immune to the effect for 24 hours.
