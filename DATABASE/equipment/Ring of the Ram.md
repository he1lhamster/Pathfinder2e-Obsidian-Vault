This heavy iron ring is shaped to look like the head of a ram, with curling horns.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> or more (Interact) **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** A ram-shaped blast of force slams into one foe that you can see within 60 feet. The number of actions you spend to Activate this Item (from 1 to 3) determines the intensity of the force. The blow deals 2d6 force damage per action spent and pushes the target 5 feet per action spent. The target must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage and is pushed half the distance.
**Failure** The target takes full damage and is pushed the full distance.
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is pushed twice the distance.
