This miniature iron cudgel is typically affixed to a weapon by an iron chain. When you activate the cudgel, you use [[DATABASE/feat/Brutal Finish|Brutal Finish]], as the fighter feat. You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the press trait.
 If you have the Brutal Finish feat, add two additional weapon damage dice on a success or a failure.
