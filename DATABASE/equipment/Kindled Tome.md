A _kindled tome_ is a [[Book of Lingering Blaze]] awakened to sapience and imbued with an enthusiasm for fire. It encourages you to learn new fire spells to inscribe within its pages. When you attempt a skill check to [[Learn a Spell]] to add a spell with the fire trait to the _kindled tome_, you treat your result as one step better than you rolled. The tome can be disparaging about other spells as “a waste of good page space,” especially if those spells have the cold or water traits. In addition to the activation of a _book of lingering blazes_, a _kindled tome_ has the following activations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You Cast a Spell with the fire trait; **Effect** The tome makes the flames linger, dealing 2d6 [[Persistent Damage]] to all you hit with or who fail the saving throw against the effect (doubling on a critical success on a spell attack and on a critical failure on a saving throw).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The tome casts [[Fireball]] at 5th level to your specifications.
