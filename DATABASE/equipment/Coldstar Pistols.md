One [[DATABASE/weapon/Dueling Pistol|dueling pistol]] in this paired set is etched with flames along its barrel, while the other is etched with icicles. In these separate forms, one gun comprising the _Coldstar Pistols_ functions as a _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Flaming|greater flaming]] dueling pistol_ and the other as a _+3 greater striking [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost|greater frost]] dueling pistol_. When joined, the guns form a double-barreled weapon that functions as a _+4 major striking greater flaming greater frost dueling pistol_. The combined form has a range increment of 120 feet. In either form, the Coldstar Pistols have the agile, concealable, concussive, and fatal d10 traits. As star guns, the _Coldstar Pistols_ run on magic and don't use ammunition or black powder.
