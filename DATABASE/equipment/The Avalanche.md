_The Avalanche_ represents unmitigated disasters, destruction that overruns all in its path. As long as _The Avalanche_ is invested, you gain a +1 item bonus to damage rolls with Strikes that inflict bludgeoning damage. This increases to a +2 item bonus if you're at least 14th level, and a +3 item bonus if you're at least 18th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You wave the card in the air and hurl staggering volumes of ice, snow, and rocks out into the world. This magical avalanche buries your foes. Choose up to 4 creatures within 60 feet, each of whom must attempt a Reflex save against your class DC. Regardless of their saving throw, the creature's space becomes greater difficult terrain from the mounds of ice, snow, and rubble.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed into an adjacent space of its choice.
**Failure** The creature takes 10d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]], and is [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 20d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]].
