The head of this arrow is made from gleaming copper. When an activated _storm arrow_ hits a target, it is buffeted by raging winds and struck by a bolt of lightning that deals 3d12 electricity damage and the target must attempt a DC 25 Reflex saving throw. If this arrow is shot from a weapon with a [[DATABASE/equipment/Shifting|shock]] property rune, the save DC increases to 27, though the attack doesn’t benefit from the _shock_ property rune itself.
**Critical Success** The foe is unaffected.
**Success** The foe takes half damage and isn’t affected by the wind.
**Failure** The foe takes full damage and is buffeted by winds for 1 round, taking a –2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls and a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its fly Speed.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the foe takes double damage.
