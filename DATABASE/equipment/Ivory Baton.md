This white, slender rod bears intricately carved reliefs of magnificent animals that bow and dance to some unseen commander. The baton enables you to command constructs.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact (enchantment, incapacitation) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You take control of a construct. This has the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] with a DC of 30, but it affects only constructs. It lacks the mental trait and functions on mindless constructs. It also ignores any [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Golem|golem antimagic]] the target might have. The effect's duration ends if the baton is destroyed or leaves your possession for at least 1 minute, and you can issue commands to the target only while holding the baton.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You closely direct the actions of one construct you control and can see within 60 feet. That construct gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws (except saving throws against the _ivory baton_).
