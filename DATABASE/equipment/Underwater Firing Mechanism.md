This device replaces the attached firearm's normal firing mechanism (normally, most of the guns in this chapter use a flintlock or matchlock firing mechanism). When the firearm's wielder fires the weapon, a small rune etched on a piece of stone affixed inside the mechanism releases a magical spark that's propelled through the firing mechanism and into the firearm, launching its bullet. An _underwater firing mechanism_ allows the attached firearm to be fired underwater or in other conditions that would normally prevent the ignition of black powder. Attaching an _underwater firing mechanism_ to a firearm takes 1 hour, though this time can overlap with the standard time required to maintain and clean your firearm to prevent misfires.
