This tiny serrated dagger looks like a miniature [[DATABASE/weapon/Sawtooth Saber|sawtooth sabre]]. Until activated, it is too small and ornamental to function as a weapon, which might allow it to be passed off as a weapon-shaped decoration.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You transform the _dagger of eternal sleep_ into a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Grievous|grievous]] striking dagger_ and Strike an unconscious target with the dagger. If you are not in an encounter or otherwise threatened and you roll a hit with your Strike, you get a critical hit instead. The damage from the Strike and the bleed from the critical specialization effect do not awaken the target, though the target becomes temporarily immune to this effect until the next time it wakes up, meaning further _daggers of eternal sleep_ awaken it as normal. The dagger disintegrates immediately after use.
