Found throughout Golarion, these star-shaped talismans of whalebone scrimshaw are carved by Erutaki from the Crown of the World. They are popular with adherents to the cult of [[DATABASE/deity/Desna|Desna]], who believe the talismans protect their dreams.
 When you activate this talisman, you gain a +2 status bonus to saves against enchantment magic with the mental trait for 1 minute. On the triggering save, if the outcome of the roll is a failure, you get a success instead, or if the outcome is a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
