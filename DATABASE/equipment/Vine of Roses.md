This _+1 [[Striking]] [[Disrupting]] [[Spiked Chain]]_ comes in a rich, green color with rose petals painted on the handle in varying shades of red and pink. The chain seems to banish nearby shadows.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You hold the chain out before you, and the weapon glows as bright as a [[Torch]]. You can suppress this light by Activating the weapon again.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You critically succeed at a Strike against a fiend or undead; **Effect** The weapon unleashes its light in an attempt to destroy the target. The _vine of roses_ casts a 3rd-level [[Searing Light]] spell with the triggering creature as the target. In place of a spell attack roll, make a weapon attack roll with the _vine of roses_ using the same multiple attack penalty as the triggering Strike.
