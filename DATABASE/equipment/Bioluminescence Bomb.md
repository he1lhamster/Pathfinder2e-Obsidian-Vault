This vial of glowing goo constantly sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. When a bioluminescence bomb strikes a creature or a hard surface, it shatters and releases the bioluminescent fluid's energy in a flare of light. Each creature within 10 feet of where the bomb exploded must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or be marked with dye that continues to glow for 24 hours. An affected creature must also attempt a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw against the overwhelming burst of light.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Blinded]] for 1 round, then dazzled for 1 round.
