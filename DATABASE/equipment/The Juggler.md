_The Juggler_ represents coordination and destiny. As long as you have _The Juggler_ invested and you aren't carrying an item in two hands, you have a free hand (as you keep tossing the items in your hands back and forth, keeping one in the air at all times). You can use all items in your hands normally, so long as they can be used or wielded in one hand. If you can't act while you're carrying more items than your actual number of hands, you release all items you're holding or wielding. If you are at least 17th level, you instead have two free hands, as you can juggle an additional item.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Trigger** an item of 1 Bulk or less falls within your reach, or an attacker fails an attack roll to hit you or a creature within your reach with a thrown weapon of 1 Bulk or less; **Effect** You grab the triggering item. If all of your hands are full (including any extra free hands from _The Juggler_), you must immediately release an item, which can include the triggering item.
