This rare gadget uses Stasian technology to grant someone a burst of activity, though its use can be painful. The electromuscular stimulator must be carefully attached to you, requiring 1 minute to do so. You can attach an electromuscular stimulator to yourself. When you Activate an attached electromuscular stimulator, roll a [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check, using the Crafting modifier of the creature who attached the stimulator to you, with a DC equal to the standard DC for your level. The effects of the activation depend on the result of the Crafting check.
**Critical Success** You gain the [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] condition for 1 minute and can use the extra action each round only to Stride or Strike.
**Success** As critical success, but you also take 3 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent electrical damage]].
**Failure** You gain the quickened condition for 2 rounds and can use the extra action each round only to Stride or Strike. You take 3 persistent electrical damage.
**Critical Failure** You take 2d6 electrical damage and 3 persistent electrical damage.
