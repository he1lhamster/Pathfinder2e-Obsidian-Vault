The burnished red faces of djezet-alloy shields attract effects made of pure magic. While you have a djezet shield [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raised]], you can use the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction when you would take energy damage in addition to the reaction's usual trigger. When taking energy damage from a spell, the shield's listed Hardness doubles.
