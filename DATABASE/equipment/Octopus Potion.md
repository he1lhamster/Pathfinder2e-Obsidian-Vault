Eight flailing octopus arms covered in suckers pop out from the sides of your body when you imbibe this potion. The arms share your multiple attack penalty and attempt to [[Grapple]] a random enemy within 15 feet of you. On a success, roll 1d4 to determine an additional effect of the arms, which lasts as long as the target remains grabbed or restrained by the arms. On subsequent turns, you can use a single action, which has the attack trait, to have the arms either Grapple a creature currently [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] (with no added effect) or release any creature they currently hold and repeat their initial effect. After 1 minute, the arms disappear and the potion's effects end.

|   1d4 | Added Effect                                                                                                                                |
|------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     1 | The arms cover the eyes; the target is also [[Blinded]].                                                         |
|     2 | The arms cover the mouth; the target can't speak.                                                                                           |
|     3 | The arms wrap around the limbs; the flat check for the target to use a manipulate action while grabbed is DC 7 instead of DC 5.             |
|     4 | The arms crush your enemy; the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to the potion's level immediately and at the end of each of its turns. |
