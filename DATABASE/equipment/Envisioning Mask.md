These strange masks consist of a thin stone hood and a shimmering purple veil reminiscent of the [[DATABASE/monster/Pleroma|pleroma aeon]] who first gifted them to mortals in the hope that sharing the means of aeon communication would reduce the misunderstandings and conflicts among mortal civilizations. An _envisioning mask_ covers your entire face, though it doesn't hinder your vision or other senses.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You lose the ability to produce language and instead communicate wordlessly through a series of psychic projections. This acts as [[DATABASE/monsterability/Telepathy|telepathy]] with a range of 100 feet, but it is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have a language. When communicating with non-[[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Aeon|aeons]], however, your meaning is often vague and mysterious. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.
