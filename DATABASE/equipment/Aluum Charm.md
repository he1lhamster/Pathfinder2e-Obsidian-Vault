This ornate pendant of brass is adorned with a vibrant blue gemstone. An _aluum charm_ grants control over a particular [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Aluum|aluum]] and lesser influence over other such constructs. As long as you wear an aluum’s linked _aluum charm_, that aluum follows your verbal commands, including somewhat nuanced orders like “subdue this target” or “strike anyone wearing a blue robe.”
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The charm grants you control over an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Aluum|aluum]] you can see within 60 feet, with a level equal to or lower than the charm. This has the effect of [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] and allows a DC 28 Will save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, it gets a result on its saving throw one degree higher than what it rolled. You can control only one aluum at a time using this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.
