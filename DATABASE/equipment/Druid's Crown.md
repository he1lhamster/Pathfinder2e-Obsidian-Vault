Made of materials scavenged from wild places, a _druid's crown_ can be rebuilt for a variety of benefits. The crown grants you a +1 item bonus to a skill, and can be activated to cast a spell, both depending on the material used to build the crown, as listed on the table below. If you invest and wear [[Druid's Vestments]] along with the crown, the crown's item bonus increases by 1 and its spell's DC rises to 27.
 You can invest this item only if you're a [[Druid]]. When you do, as a 10-minute activity that has the manipulate trait, you can disassemble and rebuild the crown with different materials, changing its item bonus and spell accordingly.
