When lit, this black candle's eerie blue flame reveals the presence of invisible creatures. Within a 10-foot radius of the lit candle, creatures don't benefit from the [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] condition. Their bodies are outlined, not fully visible, so they are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]]. Once lit, the candle burns for 1 minute, after which the effect ends. If extinguished, it can't be relit.
