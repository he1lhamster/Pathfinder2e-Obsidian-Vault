Each _purloining cloak_ is a [[DATABASE/equipment/Mercurial Mantle|mercurial mantle]] once worn by a legendary thief or two. The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Palm an Object|Palm an Object]] or [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]], proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a _mercurial mantle_, a _purloining cloak_ has the following activations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision ; **Effect** The cloak casts 2nd-level [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Disguise|illusory disguise]] on you, usually to your specifications. However the cloak can choose the appearance of the illusion for you.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command ; **Effect** The cloak assesses the price of valuables it can see. This valuation doesn't include the value of features the cloak can't discern, such as magical properties.
