Constructed of dull gray metal, this [[Breastplate]] is decorated with the symbol of a craggy black mountaintop. This breastplate functions as a _+3 [[Resilient]] breastplate_. When you're [[Shove]] or otherwise forced to move, you can reduce the amount you move by up to 10 feet. When you invest the breastplate, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You pound a solid and constant rhythm on your breastplate and cast a 7th-level [[Regenerate]] spell on yourself.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** With a single tap, you gain immunity to poison for 1 minute.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You fail or critically fail a Fortitude saving throw; **Effect** If you failed the saving throw, it becomes a success. If you critically failed, it becomes a failure instead.
