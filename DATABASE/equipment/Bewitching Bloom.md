While dormant, this tattoo appears to be a simple flower bud, but when activated the flower swiftly blossoms, remaining that way until the next time you make your daily preparations. These blooms are colorful, elegant representations of distinct flower species, as determined by its type.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Choose a willing ally you can see within 30 feet. The ally fills with an emotion themed to the flower and gains the benefit listed for the type of _bewitching bloom_ you have.

## Bewitching Bloom (Amaranth)<span class="item-type">Item 15</span>

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 5,500 gp
The ally feels impervious, immortal. The next time they would take damage from a hazard, an enemy's attack, or an effect created by an enemy, that damage can't reduce the ally below 1 HP. This benefit ends if unused before the start of your next turn.

## Bewitching Bloom (Bellflower)<span class="item-type">Item 7</span>

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 350 gp
A need for freedom trills through your ally's blood. Until the end of that ally's next turn, they gain a +2 status bonus to rolls to recover from the [[Confused]], [[Frightened]], [[Grabbed]], [[Paralyzed]], and [[Restrained]] conditions. When you Activate the bloom, the target can attempt a new save against a condition the bonus applies to, or they can use a reaction to attempt to [[Escape]] being grabbed, [[Immobilized]], or restrained, provided such an attempt is allowed.

## Bewitching Bloom (Cherry Blossom)<span class="item-type">Item 3</span>

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 50 gp
The ally understands the fleeting nature of life and accepts fate. For 1 minute, any recovery checks the ally attempts have a DC of 10 instead of 10 + the ally's [[Dying]] value. The cherry blossom's activation can target an [[Unconscious]] or dying ally.

## Bewitching Bloom (Lilac)<span class="item-type">Item 2</span>

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 25 gp
Memories bubble to the surface of your ally's mind. The ally attempts to [[Recall Knowledge]] with a +2 status bonus to the check from these vibrant memories.

## Bewitching Bloom (Lotus)<span class="item-type">Item 9</span>

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 600 gp
A glow envelops your ally as a sense of enlightened peace ripples out from within. The ally gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves against mental effects for 1 minute. This bonus increases to +3 against emotion effects.

## Bewitching Bloom (Magnolia)<span class="item-type">Item 6</span>

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 220 gp
Your ally seems more charming, though no one can pinpoint why. They gain a +1 status bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks for 10 minutes. Once on their next turn, the ally can attempt to draw a creature's attention. To do so, the ally must spend 1 action (which has the emotion, mental, and visual traits) to select a creature the ally can see and make eye contact in a way the target can see. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be [[Fascinated]] with your ally until the end of that ally's next turn. If the save succeeds or the effect ends, the target is temporarily immune to being fascinated by any _magnolia bewitching bloom_ for 24 hours.

## Bewitching Bloom (Purple Iris)<span class="item-type">Item 11</span>

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 1,200 gp
Your ally takes on a regal bearing, exuding the presence of confident royalty. The bloom casts a 5th-level [[Command]] spell (DC 28) selecting targets within range of the ally. Each target that fails the save must fall [[Prone]] and pays homage to your ally.

## Bewitching Bloom (Red Rose)<span class="item-type">Item 4</span>

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 90 gp
The ally fills with feelings of love. They chooses a creature that the ally has strong positive emotions toward as beloved. While the ally is within 10 feet of this beloved, the ally gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws. If the ally starts their turn within 10 feet of the beloved, the ally gains 5 temporary Hit Points. These benefits last for 1 minute, and temporary HP remaining from this effect at the end of that time disappear. This effect has the emotion and mental traits.

## Bewitching Bloom (White Poppy)<span class="item-type">Item 4</span>

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 80 gp
A sense of peace overwhelms the ally. The tattoo casts [[Calm Emotions]] or [[Sanctuary]] (your choice) on the ally. The spell affects only the ally and lasts only until the end of your next turn. Your ally need not be willing if under the [[Controlled]] of another creature. However, the controlling creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save, disrupting your activation on a success.
