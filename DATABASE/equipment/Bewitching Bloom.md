While dormant, this tattoo appears to be a simple flower bud, but when activated the flower swiftly blossoms, remaining that way until the next time you make your daily preparations. These blooms are colorful, elegant representations of distinct flower species, as determined by its type.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Choose a willing ally you can see within 30 feet. The ally fills with an emotion themed to the flower and gains the benefit listed for the type of _bewitching bloom_ you have.

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 220 gp
Your ally seems more charming, though no one can pinpoint why. They gain a +1 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks for 10 minutes. Once on their next turn, the ally can attempt to draw a creature's attention. To do so, the ally must spend 1 action (which has the emotion, mental, and visual traits) to select a creature the ally can see and make eye contact in a way the target can see. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] with your ally until the end of that ally's next turn. If the save succeeds or the effect ends, the target is temporarily immune to being fascinated by any _magnolia bewitching bloom_ for 24 hours.

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 1,200 gp
Your ally takes on a regal bearing, exuding the presence of confident royalty. The bloom casts a 5th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Command|command]] spell (DC 28) selecting targets within range of the ally. Each target that fails the save must fall [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] and pays homage to your ally.

While the ally is within 10 feet of this beloved, the ally gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws. If the ally starts their turn within 10 feet of the beloved, the ally gains 5 temporary Hit Points. These benefits last for 1 minute, and temporary HP remaining from this effect at the end of that time disappear. This effect has the emotion and mental traits.

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 80 gp
A sense of peace overwhelms the ally. The tattoo casts [[DATABASE/spell/Calm Emotions|calm emotions]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Sanctuary|sanctuary]] (your choice) on the ally. The spell affects only the ally and lasts only until the end of your next turn. Your ally need not be willing if under the [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|control]] of another creature. However, the controlling creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save, disrupting your activation on a success.
