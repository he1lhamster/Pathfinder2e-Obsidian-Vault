This bladder of water explodes when put under pressure or upon being punctured, dealing minimal damage, neutralizing acids, and dousing flames. A water bomb deals the listed bludgeoning damage and bludgeoning splash damage. On a hit, if the target is suffering from [[Persistent Damage]], it can attempt a flat check to end that persistent damage immediately. As this is particularly effective assistance, the DC of the flat check is reduced from 15 to 10 for this check. On a hit against an unattended, non-magical fire, the bomb extinguishes the fire, or extinguishes one square of fire for a larger fire. Many types grant an item bonus to attack rolls, and some types extinguish wider areas of fire.
