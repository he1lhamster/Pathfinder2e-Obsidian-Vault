Kept as a closely guarded secret by the deadly members of the [[DATABASE/archetype/Red Mantis Assassin|Red Mantis assassins]], this poison is treated with reverence for its ability to end lives. If the victim dies while affected by this poison, its body decomposes to nothing in 1 minute, leaving only its gear behind. Non-magical preservation can't protect the tainted corpse. [[DATABASE/spell/Gentle Repose|Gentle repose]] works on the poisoned body only if cast as a 5th-level spell and the caster succeeds at a counteract check against the poison's saving throw DC when casting the spell. Even if cast successfully, gentle repose only works as if it had been cast at 2nd level.
 **Saving Throw** DC 42 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 7d12 poison damage and [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]] (1 round); **Stage 2** 9d12 poison damage and doomed 2 (1 round) **Stage 3** 11d12 poison damage and doomed 3 (1 round)
