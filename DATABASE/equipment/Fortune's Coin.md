This coin is struck with the image of a beatific seraph in gold on one side and a fearsome fiend with seven eyes enameled in black on the other. While it may seem nothing more than a curiosity, it's a powerful agent of fortune when activated.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Trigger** You fail a check or attack; **Effect** Flip the coin. If it lands on the seraph side, you get a 12 on the die instead of what you rolled. If it lands on the fiend side, one of the eyes on the fiend closes. Either way, you're temporarily immune to _fortune's coin_ for 1 hour. When all seven eyes are closed, the coin vanishes into a puff of smoke, disappearing forever. This activation is a fortune effect, regardless of how the coin flip lands.
