A _ghost delivery fulu's_ inscription resembles a dovecote with spirits around it, and it has a prominent stamp in red wax. This fulu activates once affixed, becoming the homing location of [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Courier Fulu|ghost courier fulus]] with a matching stamp. Delivered _ghost courier fulu_ messages stick to the _ghost delivery fulu_ but can be easily removed.
