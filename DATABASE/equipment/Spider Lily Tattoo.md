The _spider lily tattoo_ marks you as a trusted member of Granny Hu's network. This crimson tattoo fades and becomes invisible within a day of being applied, reappearing only when you Activate it, when you gain the [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]] condition, or when you die. The higher the doomed value, the more vivid the color. If your tattoo is plainly visible, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks against all creatures that can see the tattoo, but you take a –1 item penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on those who understand the actual meaning of the _spider lily tattoo_ (including all of Willowshore's citizens).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision (concentrate) **Requirements** Your tattoo isn't currently visible; **Effect** You make the tattoo visible. You can use this activation again to make the tattoo not visible, unless you have the doomed condition.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** An undead creature detects you for the first time; **Effect** The _spider lily tattoo_ manipulates your life force to make you appear to be undead for a short time. Attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check against the triggering undead creature's Perception DC. On a success, the triggering undead believes you're undead as well—a mindless undead is likely to ignore you, while a sapient undead might react with curiosity or confusion. You can continue attempting Deception checks each round as a single action to Sustain the effect for up to 1 minute.
