These thin cloth wraps, which are illegal to use in Highhelm's organized brawls, blend into the skin and add an edge to your blows. The wraps are _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Wounding|wounding]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Handwraps of Mighty Blows|handwraps of mighty blows]]_. When you invest the wraps, they gain the effects of a 3rd-level [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Aura|magic aura]] spell to appear non-magical and resemble simple bandages. Casual observers are unlikely to notice anything amiss with the wraps, but a creature that succeeds at a DC 25 Perception check can notice something is off about them, though they would still need to find other means to discern the magical nature of the wraps.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per minute; **Trigger** You cause a creature within reach to take bleed damage; **Effect** You use your foe's pain to reinvigorate you. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the value of the triggering bleed damage, up to a maximum of 10 temporary HP. These temporary Hit Points remain for 1 minute.
