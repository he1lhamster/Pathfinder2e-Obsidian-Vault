This fulu comes in four pieces, one placed in each cardinal direction. Choose one of the following traits when Activating the fulus: animal, beast, celestial, fey, fiend, humanoid, monitor, plant, or undead. Those within the fulus' circle upon activation (including the fulus themselves) gain the effect of [[Invisibility Sphere]], but only against creatures with the chosen trait. If any of the fulus are moved or destroyed after activation, the effect ends.
