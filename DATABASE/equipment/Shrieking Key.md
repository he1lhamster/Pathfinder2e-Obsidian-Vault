A skull-topped metal shrieking key appears to be a [[DATABASE/equipment/Skeleton Key|skeleton key]], useful in place of [[DATABASE/equipment/Thieves' Tools|thieves' tools]] when attempting to [[DATABASE/action/Pick a Lock|Pick a Lock]]. A _shrieking key_ has no activation, however. When you use it to Pick a Lock, the key emits a loud shriek audible for 500 feet despite ambient noise. Physical barriers still block or muffle the shriek as normal. You also take a –2 circumstance penalty to the [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check rather than enjoying a bonus. After you attempt such a check with the key the first time, it fuses to you, returning to your possession if discarded. To use another device to Pick a Lock, you must first succeed at a DC 20 Will save.
