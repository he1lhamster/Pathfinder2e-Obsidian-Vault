This small doll in the shape of a witch is made from sticks and clad in a simple dress, bonnet, and wooden shoes. It sits astride a miniature straw broom. When hung in a kitchen, the witch brings good luck and protects a cook from malicious spirits. The _lucky kitchen witch_ must hang in a kitchen for a week to give any benefit.
 When you have a _lucky kitchen witch_ hung in your kitchen, you can reroll a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Cooking Lore]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check made during downtime to make food, [[DATABASE/action/Earn Income|Earn Income]], or [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]] an alchemical item in your kitchen.
