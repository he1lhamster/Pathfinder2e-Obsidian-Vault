Small bolts of brightly colored electricity flicker through the cloudy _mind-swap potion_. The potion often comes in a double-chambered flask, because when you drink it, you consume half the contents. If another creature of the same ancestry consumes the remainder of the contents within 1 minute, your minds swap per the effect of a critical success on a [[DATABASE/ritual/Mind Swap|mind swap]] ritual. The effects last for 24 hours or until one of you Dismisses the activation.
