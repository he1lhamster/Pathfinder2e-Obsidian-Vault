These symbols convey protective forces from the Elemental Planes. You gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The crafter chooses the damage type when creating the rune. Multiple _energy-resistant_ runes can be etched onto a suit of armor; rather than using only the highest-level effect, each must provide resistance to a different damage type. For instance, a _+2 acid-resistant greater fire-resistant breastplate_would give you acid resistance 5 and fire resistance 10.
