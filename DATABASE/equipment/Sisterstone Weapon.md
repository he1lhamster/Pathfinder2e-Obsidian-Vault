A weapon with a sisterstone striking surface can be charged with undead-destroying energy in response to violence from an undead creature. A creature wielding a sisterstone weapon gains the following activation. Only melee weapons can be made of sisterstone.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Trigger** The ally is critically hit by a Strike from an undead creature you can see; **Requirements** A reciprocal field is active between this weapon and an ally's sisterstone armor or sisterstone weapon; **Effect** Your weapon leaps out with positive energy in retaliation. Strike the triggering undead with the weapon, and your Strike deals 2 additional positive damage. The positive damage increases to 4 if your sisterstone weapon is standard grade, or 6 if it's high grade. If the triggering undead is beyond the reach of your sisterstone weapon, your Strike doesn't deal its base damage, but can still deal the positive damage.
