This cute and unassuming dragon toy activates once a creature moves into its square. It then unleashes a rapid burst of toxic gas in a 10-foot emanation. Those within the emanation when the snare is activated must attempt a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is sickened 2.
