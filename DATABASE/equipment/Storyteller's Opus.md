This green spellbook with gold trim contains a cautionary story about a boy who was eaten by a wolf after he previously lied about wolf attacks. When opened, the engravings on the front seem to move in a loop, enacting this story.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** A creature succeeds, but doesn't critically succeed, at a Perception check to disbelieve an illusion spell you prepared from this grimoire; **Effect** You quickly tell a fib to try to smooth over the inconsistencies in your illusion. Attempt a [[Deception]] check against the triggering creature's Perception DC. If you succeed, the creature doesn't disbelieve the illusion.
