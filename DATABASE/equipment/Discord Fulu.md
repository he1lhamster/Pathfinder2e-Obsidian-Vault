Incorporating green in its writing, a _discord fulu_ is a popular but unethical tool often deployed on romantic rivals to foil their advances. While the fulu is affixed to it, a creature treats its attitude toward other creatures as one step worse than it is. The creature also takes a –1 status penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks. The first failure the creature rolls on a Diplomacy check becomes a critical failure instead, and the fulu turns to ash, ending its effect.
