Lethargy poison is commonly used in hit-and-run tactics by [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Drow|drow]] and others who want their victims alive; the ambusher retreats until the poison sets in and the victim falls unconscious. Further exposure to lethargy poison does not require the target to attempt additional saving throws; only failing an saving throw against an ongoing exposure can progress its stage.
**Saving Throw** DC 18 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 4 hours; **Stage 1** [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] (1 round); **Stage 2** slowed 1 (1 minute); **Stage 3** [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] with no Perception check to wake up (1 round); **Stage 4** unconscious with no Perception check to wake up (1d4 hours).
