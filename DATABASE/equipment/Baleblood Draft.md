## Cryptid Side Effects

The following side effects are appropriate for a baleblood draft or other items made from cryptids.

* Your shadow appears to be that of a monstrous, winged fiend. It sometimes claws and clutches at nearby creatures, even when you don't move.
* Light breezes die in your presence, and weather vanes within 50 feet turn slowly to point in your direction, creaking gloomily as they twist.
* Every time you cross the threshold of a sanctified place, you hear a phantom crash of thunder and are struck by a visible web of ghostly electricity, which causes no real damage but forces you to flinch.
* Your reflection appears as a pallid, skeletal version of yourself with distended fangs and sunken eyes. Any drawing or depiction of you made during this time transforms, over the course of an hour, into the same appearance.
* From dusk till dawn, wet blood wells up from the ground to fill your footsteps. Attempts to track you during this period gain a +4 circumstance bonus.
* Food and drink lose all their color after 24 hours in your possession, becoming monochrome black and white. This doesn't affect the edibility of your supplies.
* Your voice rises to a high, vibrating chorus of whispers that seems to contain at least five different voices speaking in unison. Your breath reeks of sulfur, and in cold air, the clouds you exhale are yellow rather than white.
* Your skin becomes disconcertingly clammy and anyone who touches you feels a brief, tingling numbness as though they had encountered a mild contact poison. You leave behind distinct fingerprints on every surface you touch, even those that shouldn't normally hold fingerprints—but the prints aren't your own.

This vial of murky, acrid-smelling liquid is derived from a blend of strange blood, typically coming from aberrations and cryptids. It has no special properties when used alone, but if you drink one shortly before drinking an alchemical elixir, you enhance the elixir's duration. Many tales of mysterious cryptids are actually based on encounters with people suffering the aftereffects of such concoctions.
 After drinking a baleblood draft, the next elixir you drink within 1 minute that has a duration of at least 1 minute and at most 1 hour has its duration extended by 50% (so a [[DATABASE/equipment/Cheetah's Elixir|lesser cheetah's elixir]] lasts for a minute and a half instead of 1 minute).
 However, after pairing baleblood draft with another elixir, you suffer an eerie side effect for 1 week. This side effect never causes serious harm, although it might be inconvenient and is always ominous in appearance. All elixirs made in the same batch cause the same side effect. Drinking another draft with the same side effect extends the side effect's duration by another week, and drinking one with a different side effect causes you to suffer both effects simultaneously.
