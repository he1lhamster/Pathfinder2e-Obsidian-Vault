This magically reinforced [[DATABASE/shield/Wooden Shield|wooden shield]] (Hardness 6, HP 36, BT 18) normally has a blank face. It can absorb a staff and transform between a shield and staff. When you prepare a staff, you can hold it up to the shield, at which point the items will merge, and the shield's face becomes an image corresponding to the type of magic, such as a skull for a [[DATABASE/equipment/Staff of Necromancy|staff of necromancy]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You change the _staff-storing shield_ from its shield form into the stored staff, which has an image of the shield on it, or change it from the stored staff back into a shield.
