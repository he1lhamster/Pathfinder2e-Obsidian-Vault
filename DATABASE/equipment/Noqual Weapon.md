Noqual weapons are inimical to summoned creatures and spell effects that can be damaged by conventional attacks. Against such targets, a Strike with a noqual weapon gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to twice the number of weapon damage dice. In addition, noqual weapons disrupt spellcasters' concentration, causing them to become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 round on a critical hit.
