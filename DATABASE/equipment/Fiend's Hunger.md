The blade of this _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|low-grade silver]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_ has a sickly red tinge. Though once used to send souls to empower Kugaptee, the fury of those slain by the blade now allow its wielder to periodically strike back against fiends.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command (divine, enchantment, mental) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You score a critical hit against a fiend; **Effect** Vengeful echoes of the fallen lance out into the psyche of the fiend struck. After the normal effects of the critical hit, the target must roll a DC 18 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature becomes distracted by vengeful spirits and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of your next turn.
**Failure** As success, but the creature is also [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is slowed 1 for 1 minute.
