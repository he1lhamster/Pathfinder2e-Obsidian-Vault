Peachwood weapons have a particularly auburn tinge to them when under direct sunlight. Peachwood is treated as [[DATABASE/equipment/Darkwood Weapon|darkwood]] for any undead creatures' resistances or weaknesses related to darkwood (allowing a peachwood weapon to bypass a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire, Jiang-Shi|jiang-shi's]] resistance, for example). In addition, peachwood weapons bypass a small portion of the resistances of any undead creature. Strikes with a peachwood weapon treat an undead's resistances against physical damage as 2 lower for standard-grade peachwood, and 4 lower for high-grade.
