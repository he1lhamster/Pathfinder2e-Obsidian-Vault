This rune prevents enemies from escaping your grasp by fleeing to other planes. If you critically hit a target with an _anchoring_ weapon, the weapon casts [[DATABASE/spell/Dimensional Anchor|dimensional anchor]] on the target (DC 27, counteract modifier +17).

When you critically hit a target with a weapon with the anchoring rune, the weapon casts 8th-level _dimensional anchor_ on the target (DC 38, counteract modifier +28), except that if the target critically succeeds at its Will save, instead of having no effect, the _dimensional anchor_ lasts for 1 round. When you hit a target with the weapon but don't critically hit, the target is affected by 4th-level _dimensional anchor_ for 1 round without a save (this still uses a counteract modifier of +28).
