Pickpocket's tailoring modifies an existing outfit by adding concealed interior pockets and strategically opened seams for hiding small objects inside the lining. You gain a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]] of light Bulk or less in the pockets. When you get a failure (but not a critical failure, which works as normal) on a Stealth check to Conceal such an Object, observers know you're concealing an object somewhere, but they don't find the object unless they succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to locate the seams in the garment.
