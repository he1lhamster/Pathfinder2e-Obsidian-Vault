A _potion of retaliation_ is available in four varieties—acid, cold, electricity, and fire—each with a faint shimmer reminiscent of the energy it contains. For 1 minute after drinking a _potion of retaliation_, you glow with a faint aura of that energy, and a creature that touches you (such as by making an unarmed attack or using a spell with a range of touch against you) takes damage of that type. The moderate, greater, and major versions also damage an adjacent creature that hits you with a melee weapon Strike.
