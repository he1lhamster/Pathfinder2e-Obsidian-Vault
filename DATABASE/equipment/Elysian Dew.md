When you drink sweet, sky-blue _Elysian dew_, for 1 minute, you gain a 10-foot aura that evokes the vitality of [[DATABASE/plane/Elysium|Elysium]], causing nearby objects to seem more colorful and plants to stand taller. You and any ally that starts its turn in the emanation gain 5 temporary Hit Points, a +1 item bonus to saving throws, and a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks until the start of your or the ally's next turn. If you're evil and drink this potion, it fails to work, and you must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or the potion renders you [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]].
