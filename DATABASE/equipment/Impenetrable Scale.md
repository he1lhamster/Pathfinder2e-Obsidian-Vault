Made of overlapping, lustrous black scales of standard-grade adamantine, this _+2 greater resilient [[DATABASE/equipment/Fortification|fortification]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Armor|adamantine]] [[DATABASE/armor/Scale Mail|scale mail]]_ seems to momentarily thicken at the point of impact when hit. Whenever the armor’s _fortification_ rune successfully turns a significant foe’s critical hit into a normal hit, one of the scales on the armor turns violet. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to the number of violet scales, to a maximum of 8.
 At dawn each day, all the violet scales return to normal.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include 1,600 gp of adamantine.
