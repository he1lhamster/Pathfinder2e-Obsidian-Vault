A rod of blackened bone with a bulb at one end comprises a _reaper's spellgun_, which feels heavier than it looks. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun fires a shadowy ray, then dissolves into gray mist.
**Critical Success** The target takes 4d6 negative damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]]. If it had fewer than half its maximum Hit Points after taking the negative damage, it's drained 3 instead. If the Hit Point loss from being drained drops the creature to 0 Hit Points, it dies.
**Success** As critical success, but for the drained condition, the target is drained 1, or drained 2 if it had fewer than half its maximum HP.
