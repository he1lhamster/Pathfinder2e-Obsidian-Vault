A _private workshop_ is a model building about the size of a music box that resembles a smithy, tannery, alchemy lab, or other crafting facility.
**Activate** 1 minute (command, envision, Interact) ; **Effect** The model workshop transforms into a full-sized square workshop of the represented type. The walls are 15 feet wide and the ceiling is 10 feet high. The workshop is stocked with mundane tools and can be used to [[Craft]] items appropriate to the workshop with a +1 item bonus, but you must supply any raw materials.
 You can pull on a cord hanging from the workshop's ceiling as an Interact action to revert the _private workshop_ to its model form.
