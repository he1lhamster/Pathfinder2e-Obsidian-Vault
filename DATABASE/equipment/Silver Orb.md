Filled with sharp silver flings and alchemical reagents, this glass sphere leaves behind a cloud of dangerous shards. A creature hit with the orb takes 1 slashing damage and is covered with silver filings, making weapons and unnarmed attacks damaging them be treated as silver until they spend an Interact action to clean off.
 Except on a critical miss, the filings linger airborne in a 5-foot burst around the target. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. Creatures inside the cloud are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] to those outside. Each breathing creature who ends its turn in the cloud takes the listed slashing damage from a silver source, with a basic Fortitude save.
