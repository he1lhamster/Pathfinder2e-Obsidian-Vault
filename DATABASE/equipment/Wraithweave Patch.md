A _wraithweave patch_ appears to be a square sheet of gray cloth that sparkles softly when observed in dim light. An incorporeal creature can touch, hold, and carry _wraithweave patches_ (unlike most physical objects).
 You can Interact with a _wraithweave patch_ to securely wrap up an object or container that does not exceed the _wraithweave patch's_ capacity in Bulk (as determined by the _wraithweave patch's_ type). Once an object is wrapped up, its Bulk becomes negligible, and the _wraithweave patch_ appears and behaves as if it's nothing more than a tightly folded but empty piece of cloth. You must Interact with the _wraithweave patch_ again to unfold it, at which point the wrapped object returns to its normal Bulk and can itself be interacted with again.
 Creatures wrapped in a _wraithweave patch_ are not affected and treat the patch as normal cloth. A wrapped item provides no benefits until it is unwrapped, but can be detected by magic normally. If the _wraithweave patch_ is destroyed, any object it contains reverts to normal and is exposed to the damage or effect that destroyed the _wraithweave patch_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Requirements** the wraithweave patch has been wrapped around an object and you are incorporeal; **Effect** You cause the _wraithweave patch_ and the object it contains to become incorporeal. This effect lasts as long as you Sustain the activation. The _wraithweave patch_ can only be touched, held, and carried by an incorporeal creature, and returns to solid form if not carried by such a creature—if the _wraithweave patch_ is in a solid object at this time, it tears apart and the item inside is either lost forever or simply lodged within the solid object, at the GM's discretion.
