This black leather wrist guard has a bright red gem on the inside of the wrist. Faint glyphs and words of domination in [[DATABASE/language/Infernal|Infernal]] swim inside the gem. Your words become harsh and clipped when you have this magic item invested.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You exert your will over a mindless creature within 30 feet. If the target is a mindless creature of 3rd level or lower, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If you are a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|devil]], the target uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw.
**Critical Success** The target creature is unaffected.
**Success** The target creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round as its responses are muddled by your commands.
**Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]] by you for 1 hour, although it doesn't follow commands that are obviously self-destructive.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 day.
