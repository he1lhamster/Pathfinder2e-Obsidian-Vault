Based on a Thassilonian recipe, warding punch is made from red or white wine combined with fruits, other alcohols, and alchemical reagents. Its alchemical properties provide protection against a specific school of magic depending on the ingredients chosen when it's created, granting a +1 item bonus to saving throws against spells from that school for 10 minutes.
