[[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Brine|Brine dragons]] are known to distract their foes at just the right moment, and this blue-green scale appears to have come from one of these creatures. When you activate the scale, it cracks open and releases a spray of caustic saltwater at the triggering creature. The creature takes 2d8 acid damage with a DC 24 basic Reflex save. If the creature critically fails at its save, its concentration is broken—the triggering action is disrupted.
