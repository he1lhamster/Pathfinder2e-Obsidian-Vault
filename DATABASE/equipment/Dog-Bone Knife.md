The blade of this _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_ is made from the thigh bone of a canine that died in the act of protecting its master. A [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Werecreature|werecreature]] or other creature willingly under the effects of a non-permanent polymorph effect damaged by a _dog-bone knife_ must attempt a DC 19 Will save or immediately revert to its natural form—this has no effect on a creature unwillingly polymorphed. On a successful save, the creature is temporarily immune to this effect for 1 minute. [[DATABASE/monster/Kushtaka|Kushtakas]] and other creatures vulnerable to canines take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against this effect, and this weapon overcomes any resistance such creatures have to physical attacks.
