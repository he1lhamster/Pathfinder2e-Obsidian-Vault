This mid-sized, silver cauldron is a boon within areas where access to fresh food is limited, for it can be commanded to fill itself with hearty (and delicious) vegetable stew. It can also be put to a much greater use in the pursuit of crafting certain items. When used to Craft alchemical items, potions, or oils, a bountiful cauldron grants a +2 item bonus to the Crafting check.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You stir the cauldron, and it casts a 4th-level [[Create Food]] spell, filling itself with enough delicious vegetable stew to feed 12 Medium creatures.
