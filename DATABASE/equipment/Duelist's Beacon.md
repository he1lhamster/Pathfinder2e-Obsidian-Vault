**Base Shield** [[Buckler]]

---
A spiked glove is attached to the front of this [[Buckler]] (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12), functioning as _+1 [[Striking]] [[Shield Spikes]]_. Perforations and slits line the defensive side, shining bright light through them when the item's magic is activated.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You activate the shield's inner light. Attempt a melee Strike with the _duelist's beacon_. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be [[Blinded]] for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target uses the result one degree of success worse than it rolled for its Fortitude save.
