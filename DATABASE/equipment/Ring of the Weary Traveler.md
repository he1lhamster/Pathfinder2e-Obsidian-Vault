For 10 minutes, you can ignore the penalties from the [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] condition. This does not remove the condition, it merely suppresses the penalties and drawbacks of having the condition. If something would cause you to become fatigued again while the ring’s power is in effect, the suppression ends, and you immediately take the penalties again.
