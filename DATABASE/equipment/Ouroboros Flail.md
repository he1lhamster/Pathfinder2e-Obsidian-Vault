You can easily expand and contract the chain of this _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Extending|extending]] [[DATABASE/weapon/War Flail|war flail]]_. It magically grows new links when extended and loses them when contracted.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You successfully Strike with the flail while activating its _extending_ rune; **Effect** The head of the flail wraps around the target of the triggering Strike and drags it in your direction. The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or be pulled adjacent to you. A creature pulled in is then [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] by the flail until the end of your next turn unless you move, your target [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]] (DC 31), or you use the flail.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact ; **Effect** You extend the flail's chain, then wrap it across itself and strike two links together. This severs a usable 60-foot loop of chain from the flail, which instantly returns to its normal length. If you use this activation again, any previous chain you created with it disappears after 1 round. As with most obviously magical and temporary constructs, the chain cannot be sold.
