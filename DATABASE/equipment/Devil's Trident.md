This _+1 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Trident]]_ is made of an ancient black metal that glistens unnaturally and is cold to the touch. The prongs of this trident drip with metallic lake water. Strikes with the _Devil's Trident_ trigger the weaknesses of any creature with a weakness to water.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Command **Trigger** You critically hit a creature; **Effect** The target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or become infected with [[Sewer Haze]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The trident casts 3rd-level [[Quench]] with a DC of 25 and a counteract modifier of +15. You can Sustain the Spell as normal.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You call upon the corrupted power of the trident to stay a foe. Attempt a Strike. On a hit, the trident casts 3rd-level [[Paralyze]] on the target (DC 25). If the Strike was a critical hit, the target is [[Stunned]] even if it critically succeeds at the save.
