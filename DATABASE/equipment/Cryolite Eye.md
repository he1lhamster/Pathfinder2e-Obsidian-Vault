You tore your eye from the socket and offered it to whatever spirit would take it. In return, you received a glass eye in its place. This eye allows you to see as normal, and when you succeed at a Perception check against an illusion, you get a critical success instead. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your bargained contract can overwhelm your _cryolite eye_ with magical energy, causing images to float over your vision that inflict the [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] condition on you for 1 minute.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You look through the glass eye sealing your _bargained contract_. The contract casts [[DATABASE/spell/See Invisibility|see invisibility]] affecting you.
