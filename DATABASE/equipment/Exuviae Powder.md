Exuviae powder comes from cast-off shells of cicada-like insects native to the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], crushed to dust. You sprinkle this powder over your body, leaving an iridescent layer reminiscent of insect chitin. After you do so, for 8 hours, you double the time you can hold your breath. During this time, you also have access to the shed chitin activation.
**Activate****—Shed Chitin** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (concentrate); **Trigger** You would be [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]]; **Effect** The powder petrifies like a shell around you instead, and its other effects end. The powder causes you to become [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] for 1 minute as well as [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] ([[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC 25). You can use the extra action each round only for Escape and Stride actions.
