A _singing sword_ is a _+1 striking [[DATABASE/weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_ imbued with the consciousness of a boisterous bard, and therefore constantly sings at all times. A _singing sword_ can’t stop singing and in fact communicates in no way other than by singing. A successful [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check against its Will DC can convince it to quiet its singing to a whisper for 10 minutes, or 20 minutes on a critical success, though it quickly grows displeased at anyone who attempts this repeatedly. The _singing sword_ can spend its actions to attack on its own, with the effects of a [[DATABASE/equipment/Dancing|dancing]] weapon’s activation, except that its attack modifier is +12. Additionally, it can perform the following activations; each casts a composition spell and follows all the usual rules for compositions.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** The _singing sword_ casts [[DATABASE/spell/Inspire Courage|inspire courage]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** The _singing sword_ casts [[DATABASE/spell/Inspire Defense|inspire defense]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You or an ally within 60 feet rolls a saving throw against an auditory effect; **Effect** The _singing sword_ casts [[DATABASE/spell/Counter Performance|counter performance]].
