A soul chain is a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Spiked Chain|spiked chain]]_ that has become cursed after a [[DATABASE/monster/Forge-Spurned|forge-spurned]] used it to kill a creature and trap its soul. In the hands of a forge-spurned, a soul chain inflicts an additional 1d6 fire damage on a hit. Other creatures can use a _soul chain_ as a standard _+1 striking spiked chain_. A _soul chain_ fuses with its wielder the first time the wielder damages a living creature with the weapon. A character who dies while carrying a _soul chain_ must attempt a DC 20 Will save; on a failure, they're immediately transformed into a forge-spurned. Carrying multiple soul chains doesn't increase the DC of the save, but the carrier must attempt the save once for each chain they carry.
