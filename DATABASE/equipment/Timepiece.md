# Timepiece<span class="item-type">Item 1+</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Clockwork</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Bulk** —
**Access** Characters from Absalom, New Thassilon, Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or especially technological regions of Arcadia like the Deadshot Lands have access to uncommon clockwork items from the first two chapters of this book.

---
Clockwork timepieces come in a variety of sizes and aesthetic styles, but they're all designed to display the accurate time of day down to the second.
 Clockwork timepieces have a 24-hour activation cycle, after which they must wound in a process that takes 1 minute to complete.

## Timepiece (Desktop Clock)<span class="item-type">Item 1</span>

**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Price** 10 gp
**Bulk** 3
Desktop clocks have been designed to be small enough to only take up a quarter of a typical writing desk's surface area, but they're still too bulky and heavy to be lugged around casually.

## Timepiece (Grand Clock)<span class="item-type">Item 3</span>

**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Price** 50 gp
**Bulk** 16
These towering, ten-foot-tall clocks have been painstakingly handcrafted by skilled artisans and feature loud chimes that can be heard hourly throughout a manor. Owners of grand clocks usually tend to display them prominently in a study, lounge area, or foyer.
