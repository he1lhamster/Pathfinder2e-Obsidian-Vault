A puzzle box features moving parts, locking mechanisms, and other components designed to confound the user. Solving a puzzle box typically requires three successful [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Games Lore]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Pick a Lock|Open a Lock]], though puzzle boxes come in countless configurations and themes, and the GM can determine which skills are appropriate.

A hollow puzzle box is designed to have an empty compartment in its center, allowing you to hide an object inside of the box. Only someone that solves the puzzle box can access the item within. A hollow puzzle box can hold an item of negligible Bulk no larger than 1 inch in diameter. Any puzzle box can be made into a hollow puzzle box. Doing so doubles the puzzle box's price.
