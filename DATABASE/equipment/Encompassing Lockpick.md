This lockpick houses a small compartment containing many smaller picks and other miniature tools. The lockpick itself is surprisingly malleable, belying the components within. An almost-impossible number of other tools are hidden in the compartment, including an entire set of [[Thieves' Tools]] and any replacement picks, an [[Disguise Kit]] and any replacement cosmetics, and an [[Climbing Kit]], all while still somehow remaining only light Bulk. This makes the _encompassing lockpick_ a favorite discreet option for rogues infiltrating high society events, as formal wear generally has few pockets and only allows a character to wear a single tool kit of light Bulk.
