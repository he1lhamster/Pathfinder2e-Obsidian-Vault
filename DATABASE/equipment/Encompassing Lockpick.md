This lockpick houses a small compartment containing many smaller picks and other miniature tools. The lockpick itself is surprisingly malleable, belying the components within. An almost-impossible number of other tools are hidden in the compartment, including an entire set of [[DATABASE/equipment/Thieves' Tools|infiltrator thieves' tools]] and any replacement picks, an [[DATABASE/equipment/Disguise Kit|elite disguise kit]] and any replacement cosmetics, and an [[DATABASE/equipment/Climbing Kit|extreme climber's kit]], all while still somehow remaining only light Bulk. This makes the _encompassing lockpick_ a favorite discreet option for rogues infiltrating high society events, as formal wear generally has few pockets and only allows a character to wear a single tool kit of light Bulk.
