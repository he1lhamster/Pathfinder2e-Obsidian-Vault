Mist fills the glass of this small circular hand mirror, creating strange patterns in the shifting gray wisps. The back of the mirror bears a flowing script engraving in an unknown language. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 23.

* **Armor** After you cast an illusion spell by activating the mirror, choose one ally within 30 feet. That ally gains a single illusory image, per [[DATABASE/spell/Mirror Image|mirror image]]. The image lasts until the end of your next turn if not destroyed before then.
* **Weapon** After you cast an illusion spell by activating the mirror, illusory copies of the weapon swirl in the air around it. You're affected by the [[DATABASE/spell/Thicket of Knives|thicket of knives]] spell until the end of your next turn. The spell ends if you stop wielding the affixed weapon.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Forbidding Ward|forbidding ward]].
