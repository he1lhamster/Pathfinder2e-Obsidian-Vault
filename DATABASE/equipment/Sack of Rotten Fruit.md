Each of these unassuming sacks contains enough rotting fruit to provide a [[DATABASE/heritage/Fungus Leshy|fungus]] [[DATABASE/ancestry/Leshy|leshy]] with 1 week's worth of rations, along with clusters of stones to help press out the fruit's juices. When you Strike a creature with a sack of rotten fruit, the sack is consumed while the creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage and must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. The range increment of a thrown sack of rotten fruit is 20 feet.
