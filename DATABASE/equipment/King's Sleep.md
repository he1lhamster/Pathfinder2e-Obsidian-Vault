King's sleep is an insidious long-term poison that can seem like a disease or even death from natural causes on a venerable target. The [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]] condition from king's sleep is cumulative with each failed save and can't be removed while the poison lasts.
**Saving Throw** DC 41 Fortitude; **Onset** 1 day; **Stage 1** drained 1 (1 day); **Stage 2** drained 1 (1 day); **Stage 3** drained 2 (1 day)
