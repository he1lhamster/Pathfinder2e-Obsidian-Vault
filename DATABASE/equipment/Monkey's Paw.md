This dried, gnarled hand is clenched in a fist, waiting for a creature to pick it up. When you pick up the _monkey’s paw_, the hand opens, revealing three withered fingers. The _monkey’s paw_ grants you three wishes, curling one finger after every one. Once you pick up the _monkey’s paw_, you cannot discard the hand until it returns to a clenched fist by casting its three wishes. Any attempts to discard the hand, even with the effects of a [[DATABASE/spell/Miracle|miracle]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] spell, are unsuccessful as the _monkey’s paw_ reappears among your possessions within 1d4 hours; it doesn’t work for any other creature in the intervening time. The hand returns even if another creature steals it from you. Once you make all three wishes, the _monkey’s paw_ uses [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|plane shift]] to travel to a random point in the multiverse.
 Whenever the _monkey’s paw_ hears you utter a statement that sounds like a wish, even if you don’t use the words “I wish,” it activates and grants a twisted, horrifying version of your wish, producing any effect within the possibility of [[DATABASE/spell/Alter Reality|alter reality]], _miracle_, [[DATABASE/spell/Primal Phenomenon|primal phenomenon]], or _wish_, and potentially a greater effect at the GM’s discretion.
