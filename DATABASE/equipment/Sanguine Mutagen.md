You gain greatly increased blood production, filtering out contagions and boosting your endurance but causing your body to bloat with blood.
 **Benefit** You gain an item bonus to Fortitude and Reflex saves. This bonus improves when you attempt a save against an effect that has the disease trait, poison trait, or would give you the [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] condition.
 **Drawback** Whenever you take piercing or slashing damage, you take 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]].
