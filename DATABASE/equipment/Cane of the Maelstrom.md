A large crystal of [[Warpglass Weapon]] floats above the head of this silvery purple _+3 [[Anarchic]] [[Striking]] [[Club]]_. If you successfully Strike a creature, the cane also affects the target with a [[Protean]]. While you carry the cane, you hear a constant, distracting chorus of laughing, incoherent [[Protean]] whispers and sing-song voices in your mind. Blatant acts of self-indulgence or narcissism quell these whispers, from a few minutes up to a full day depending on the scope of the act, but they immediately return when you use the artifact's powers. The gradually rising chorus eventually drives away rational thought and renders the cane's owner insane, even if staved off from time to time with self-centered acts. As the artifact's abilities pull material from the [[Maelstrom]], it doesn't function in areas where planar connections are severed.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** You are targeted by a ranged attack from an opponent you can see; **Effect** You draw a temporary shield of chaotic turbulence with a cerulean flash. You gain a +3 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.
**Activate** 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact) ; **Effect** The _Cane of the Maelstrom_ casts a 5th-level [[Hallucinatory Terrain]] spell and infuses the illusion with quasi-real substance drawn from the primal chaos of the Maelstrom. Creatures that don't disbelieve the illusion treat structures and terrain created through the spell as though they were real, ascending illusory stairs, becoming trapped by illusory quicksand, and so on. If no creature disbelieves the illusion during its duration, the changes become wholly real and permanent when its duration expires.
**Activate** 1 minute (Interact) ; **Effect** The _Cane of the Maelstrom_ casts a 5th-level [[Creation]] spell, except the duration is unlimited and you can create delicate or complex objects by succeeding at an applicable [[Crafting]] skill check when you activate this ability.
**Destruction** Trapping a lawful demigod in the _hallucinatory terrain_ created by the cane and leaving it imprisoned for a year and a day causes a deific overload that destroys the artifact. When the artifact is destroyed, the terrain imprisoning the demigod crumbles away and the demigod is freed.
