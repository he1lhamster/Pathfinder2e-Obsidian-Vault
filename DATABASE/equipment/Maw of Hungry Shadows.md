Shadows swirl around this soot-black tome, swallowing up any light that touches them. A faint whispering emanates from the grimoire's pages when opened.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that has the shadow trait; **Effect** Your shadow, and that of the tome, elongates and reaches hungrily for one foe within 30 feet, who must attempt a Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[Blinded]] for 1 round and [[Drained]] as the shadows scrape across it.
**Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 minute and drained 2 as the shadows seize it.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the shadows also pull the creature into the tome, teleporting it to the [[Shadow Plane]].
