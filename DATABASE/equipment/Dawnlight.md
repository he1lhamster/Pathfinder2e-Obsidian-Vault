This shining symbol of [[DATABASE/deity/Sarenrae|Sarenrae]] depicts the goddess with her arms held wide. In the center of the symbol is a crystal reliquary with a perfect feather floating inside, glowing bright as a candle with the light of the goddess.
**Activate** Cast a Spell **Frequency** once per day for each spell; **Effect** The dawnlight casts 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Disrupt Undead|disrupt undead]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Light|light]]. The _dawnlight's_ spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +7, and any spell with the light trait is treated as though its counteract level were 1 higher for counteracting darkness.
**Craft Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature with the divine tradition.

Whenever you successfully counteract magical darkness while holding this symbol, the clash of magic unleashes a momentary flash of light. Creatures with darkvision in the area of the _light_ spell or targeted by it must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round. Those with [[DATABASE/monsterability/Light Blindness|light blindness]] are also exposed to bright light.
 Change the list of spells to 3rd-level versions of _disrupt undead_, _light_, and [[DATABASE/spell/Searing Light|searing light]]. The spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +13.

## Dawnlight (Major)<span class="item-type">Item 11</span>

**Price** 1,300 gp

A _major dawnlight_ creates a flash of light like a _greater dawnlight_, but the DC is 28. Change the list of spells to 5th-level versions of _disrupt undead_ and _light_, and 4th-level versions of _searing light_ and [[DATABASE/spell/Vital Beacon|vital beacon]]. The spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +18.
