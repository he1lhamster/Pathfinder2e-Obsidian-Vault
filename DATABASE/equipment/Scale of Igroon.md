Carved from a scale of the kaiju Igroon, this jagged shield refracts light around it in a shimmering haze. A _scale of Igroon_ (Hardness 20, HP 160, BT 80) recovers 4 Hit Points at the start of its wielder's turn. When you [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]], you can use the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction with the scale of Igroon to block an attack or effect that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic damage as well as physical damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Requirements** You're in an area of bright or dim light; **Effect** You angle the shield to refract light. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +4 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] and [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]] and can do so while [[DATABASE/condition/Observed|observed]]. This bonus ends if you Activate another ability or use the Shield Block reaction.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Requirements** You're in an area of bright light; **Effect** You angle the shield at a target within 60 feet, reflecting light into its eyes. It must attempt a DC 42 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] until its next turn begins.
**Failure** The target is blinded for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The target is blinded for 2d4 hours.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> Interact **Trigger** You use Shield Block and prevent yourself from taking energy damage from a line, ray, or a direct attack, including a [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Missile|magic missile]] spell; **Effect** You reflect the energy along a trajectory you choose. The effect travels only up to its remaining range, using its original parameters if it strikes other targets.
**Destruction** If a deity, kaiju, spawn of a deity, titan, or being of similar power stomps on a _scale of Igroon_ while in absolute darkness, the shield is destroyed permanently.
