This matching mortar and pestle are made from immaculate darkwood that looks nearly olive in the right light.
**Activate** 1 minute (Interact) **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You use the _mortar of hidden meaning_ to grind tea leaves (or another suitable substance for making a hot beverage). While grinding the tea leaves, which takes no less than 1 minute, you can speak a message into the mortar. After the leaves are steeped in hot water, the first person who drinks from the resulting brew hears the message whispered in their ear.
