Rose gold and copper rings in this _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Resilient|resilient]] [[DATABASE/armor/Chain Shirt|chain shirt]]_ form a vague bird shape. The jingling links tinkle musically, almost like birdsong. While you wear the armor, effects with the auditory trait must first counteract the _harmonic hauberk_ or they have no effect on you.
 The _harmonic hauberk_ attempts to counteract [[DATABASE/spell/Silence|silence]] spells cast on you and 4th-level or higher heightened _silence_ spells the first time the armor enters their area (counteract level 4, counteract modifier +20). After failing to counteract a _silence_ spell, the armor can't attempt to counteract the same spell again, even if you leave and enter the spell's area multiple times.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** You have a pool of Focus Points and at least one composition spell; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point and immediately use the Focus Point to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Lingering Composition|lingering composition]], using your [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check to determine the effects of the spell, followed by the [[DATABASE/spell/Inspire Defense|inspire defense]] composition cantrip. You can use this activation to cast those spells even if you don't have the [[DATABASE/feat/Lingering Composition|Lingering Composition]] or [[DATABASE/feat/Inspire Defense|Inspire Defense]] feats.
