Long associated with a notorious crime boss in Nantambu, this stout _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Fearsome|fearsome]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Club|club]]_ is studded with vicious-looking knobs of obsidian and wrapped in cloth for a better grip. It emits a ghastly groan when swung.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gesture at a square within 40 feet with _Habu's Cudgel_. The club causes a frightful wail to unleash from that square and casts [[DATABASE/spell/Fear|fear]] (DC 24 Will save) targeting the creature in that square and all adjacent creatures.
