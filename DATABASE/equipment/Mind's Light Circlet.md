Gemstones of many colors adorn the silver of a _mind's light circlet_. When you're charged with mental power, the jewels scintillate with light, with different gems resonating based on your emotions. If you have at least 1 Focus Point, the gems cast dim light in a 10-foot radius. When you amp a spell, the light increases to bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) until the start of your next turn.
 You gain a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] checks. You also gain the following amp, which you can apply to any of your psi cantrips that have a target or area, much like an amp gained from a feat.
 **Amp** You transfer some of the magical luminescence from the mind's light circlet to one of the creatures. Choose a creature targeted by the spell or in its area. Until the start of your next turn, that creature sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) and can't be [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]]. If the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], it's concealed while alight, rather than being [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to use a psychic amp. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.
**Craft Requirements** You are a [[DATABASE/class_/Psychic|psychic]].
