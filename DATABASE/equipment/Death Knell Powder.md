This poison is made from toxic spores reduced to a gray powder and suffused with necromantic energy. If a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points while under the effect of _death knell powder_, it must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or die (this is a death effect). If a creature dies from _death knell powder_, a random creature adjacent to the victim is bolstered by its departing life force and gains 20 temporary HP and a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 10 minutes.
 **Saving Throw** DC 34 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 7d6 poison damage (1 round); **Stage 2** 9d6 poison damage (1 round); **Stage 3** 12d6 poison damage (1 round)
**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of [[Death Knell]].
