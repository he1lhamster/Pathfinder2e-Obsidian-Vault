This _+1 [[DATABASE/armor/Leather Lamellar|leather lamellar armor]]_ incorporates the plates of a [[DATABASE/monster/Rust Monster|rust monster's]] hide, woven together with the creature's own antennae and sinew into a functional set of armor. While wearing the _rusting carapace_, you gain a +2 item bonus to your Reflex save to prevent an object you're holding from being affected by rust; this also increases your Reflex DC to avoid being [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarmed]] by a rust monster's Antenna Disarm ability.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Feathery antennae extend from between the segments of the rusting hide and brush against a nearby metal creature, non-magical metal hazard, or non-magical metal item of up to 1 Bulk, with the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Rusting Grasp|rusting grasp]]. The DC is 24.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the hide of a [[DATABASE/monster/Rust Monster|rust monster]].
