## Feather Token Ammunition

One of the more popular and commonly used tools of adventurers across Golarion are [[DATABASE/equipment/Feather Token|feather tokens]]. Several forms of _feather token_ can be purchased as ammunition by raising their item level by 2 and doubling the Price, replacing their normal activation requirement with a Strike from a ranged weapon and appearing in a space within that weapon's range. While not all _feather tokens_ are suitable for use in this way, the chest, holly bush, ladder, swan boat, and tree tokens have all been converted into ammunition at one time or another. While these utilitarian devices are not suitable for direct offense in combat (a _feather token_ fired into an occupied space fails to deploy and is wasted), they are incredibly useful for providing cover where none existed previously, making a quick escape, or coordinating an innovative heist.

Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some exotic bird. The feather’s shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.

## Feather Token (Anchor)<span class="item-type">Item 7</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 55 gp
This feather can be activated only on a boat. When activated, this feather transforms into a massive anchor that causes the boat to immediately stop. After 1 day, the anchor vanishes and the boat can move as normal. The anchor is attached to the boat by a magical chain of force, but the chain can be removed by [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] or destroyed (Hardness 30, HP 40).

## Feather Token (Bird)<span class="item-type">Item 3</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 8 gp
When activated, this token transforms into a small sparrow that waits on your finger for you to relay a message up to 1 minute in length, along with the name and rough location of a recipient. The recipient must be someone you have met, and the location must be somewhere you have visited. After receiving the message, the bird flies off to deliver it, traveling at 30 miles per hour and then searching for the target in the location you provided. If the bird finds the target, it moves adjacent to them, your words emanate from the bird, and the bird then flies off and vanishes. The bird also vanishes if it fails to find your target after 10 hours of searching the location you specified.

## Feather Token (Chest)<span class="item-type">Item 3</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 10 gp
When you use this token, a small wooden chest appears and immediately opens. This chest can hold up to 10 Bulk worth of items. Once the chest is closed, it transforms again—this time into a key—taking all of the stored items with it. You can activate this key by spending an Interact action to turn it in an imaginary lock, which causes it to transform back into a chest with all of the items still inside. Once it has turned into a chest a second time, it forever remains a wooden chest.

## Feather Token (Fan)<span class="item-type">Item 4</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 15 gp
Activating this feather requires you to fan it in a given direction. If this direction is toward the sail of a vessel, the feather flutters up toward the sail and fans continuously, filling the sail with air and granting the vessel a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed for 8 hours. If fanned in any other direction, it instead produces a single casting of [[DATABASE/spell/Gust of Wind|gust of wind]] (DC 20).

## Feather Token (Holly Bush)<span class="item-type">Item 2</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 6 gp
When this feather is activated, it immediately transforms into a living holly bush, filling a single square. This bush can provide standard cover. In addition, the bush has 2d4 bright-red berries. While holly berries are usually poisonous, these berries are infused with beneficial magic. You can pick and eat a berry as an Interact action to recover 1 Hit Point. Once plucked from the bush, a berry becomes non-magical after a few seconds, so it doesn’t heal you if you don’t eat it within the span of your Interact action.
 If activated on soil, the plant continues to grow and thrive (although it doesn’t produce any more healing berries). If activated elsewhere, it withers and dies within 1d4 days.

## Feather Token (Ladder)<span class="item-type">Item 1</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 3 gp
When activated, this feather transforms permanently into a 20-foot-long wooden ladder.

## Feather Token (Swan Boat)<span class="item-type">Item 8</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 76 gp
This feather can be activated only when tossed into a large body of water, such as a lake or broad river. It transforms into a swan-shaped boat capable of carrying up to 32 Medium creatures, 8 Large creatures, or 2 Huge creatures. The boat moves on the water at a Speed of 50 feet, and lasts 1 day.

## Feather Token (Tree)<span class="item-type">Item 6</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 38 gp
This token can be activated only on an unoccupied patch of earth or soil. When activated, this token transforms into an oak tree, 60 feet tall with a 5-foot-wide trunk. The tree continues to live and grow if conditions are favorable.

## Feather Token (Whip)<span class="item-type">Item 9</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 130 gp
This feather transforms into a _+1 striking [[DATABASE/equipment/Dancing|dancing whip]]_ when activated. The whip immediately jumps from your grasp and proceeds to attack your enemies until 1 minute has passed or it fails its flat check for _dancing_, at which point it vanishes. If the whip’s target isn’t prone, the whip uses its actions to attempt to Trip that creature instead of making a Strike. The whip’s total attack modifier for Striking or Tripping is +18 instead of the normal bonus for a _dancing_ weapon.

## Feather Token (Balloon)<span class="item-type">Item 6</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder Special. Fumbus|Pathfinder Special: Fumbus]]
**Price** 50 gp
This feather can't be activated underwater. When activated, the feather transforms into a balloon of waxed cloth that is 3 feet in diameter and filled with hot air. Handles on the bottom of the balloon allow up to two creatures sized Medium or smaller to hold onto the balloon. One round after being activated, the balloon rises up into the air at a speed of 20 feet per round. After rising for 3 rounds, the balloon floats in place for two rounds as the air inside cools, then descends at a speed of 20 feet per round. When the balloon reaches its original elevation, the balloon deflates.

## Feather Token (Puddle)<span class="item-type">Item 3</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder Special. Fumbus|Pathfinder Special: Fumbus]]
**Price** 8 gp
When activated, the feather transforms into two gallons of fresh, clear water. If no one drinks it, the water evaporates after 1 day.
