This metallic tube has a complex array of lenses and prisms at one end and a hatch at the other. The hatch can be unlocked, loaded with a [[DATABASE/equipment/Sunrod|sunrod]], and refastened using 3 Interact actions. A loaded sun dazzler can be activated to burn the sunrod to dust in a single focused flash, creating a 30-foot cone of scintillating light. All creatures in the cone must attempt a DC 24 Fortitude save, with the following effects.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round or until it spends an Interact action to rub its eyes, ending the blinded condition.
**Critical Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 round.
