The exterior of this egg-shaped brass censer is polished to a mirror-like sheen. Several rings are attached to its sides at regular intervals. The top of the censer's lid is decorated with a pair of intertwining snakes.
**Activate****—Light Incense** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (aura, manipulate); **Cost** incense worth at least 5 gp; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** A piping, reddish smoke pours from the censer in a 20-foot emanation. You choose whether the smoke causes the target's blood to turn extremely hot or transmutes to poison; the smoke deals your choice of fire or poison damage. Each living creature that's in the area or enters it attempts a DC 34 Fortitude saving throw, then becomes temporarily immune for 1 hour.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature breathes in a small amount of the poisonous smoke and takes 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]].
**Failure** The creature gulps down a lungful of the smoke, taking 4d6 persistent damage and becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] until the persistent damage ends.
**Critical Failure** The creature inhales a large amount of the smoke, taking 6d6 persistent damage and becoming enfeebled 3 until the persistent damage ends.
