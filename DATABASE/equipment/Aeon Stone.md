Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.
 When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an _aeon stone_ with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.
 There are various types of _aeon stones_, each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each _aeon stone_ also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]].

## Aeon Stone (Clear Spindle)<span class="item-type">Item 7</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 325 gp
You don’t need to eat or drink while this _aeon stone_ is invested by you. This _aeon stone_ doesn’t function until it has been worn continuously for a week and invested each day therein. If it’s invested by someone else, this interval starts over.
 The resonant power allows you to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Air Bubble|air bubble]] as a primal innate spell once per day.

## Aeon Stone (Dull Gray)<span class="item-type">Item 1</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 9 gp
A _dull gray aeon stone_ has lost its special magical properties, sometimes as a result of overusing a _tourmaline sphere_ or _pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone_. It still orbits your head like any other _aeon stone_ and can thus serve as a stylish, hands-free option for various spells that target an object, like [[DATABASE/spell/Continual Flame|continual flame]].
 _Dull gray aeon stones_ have no resonant power.

## Aeon Stone (Gold Nodule)<span class="item-type">Item 6</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 230 gp
When a _gold nodule aeon stone_ is created, its creator chooses a language they know to store within the crystal. When you invest the stone, you gain the ability to understand, speak, and write that language.
 The resonant power allows you to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Comprehend Language|comprehend language]] as an occult innate spell once per day.

## Aeon Stone (Lavender and Green Ellipsoid)<span class="item-type">Item 19</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 30,000 gp
This functions as a _pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone_, but it casts an 8th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] spell with a counteract modifier of +31.
 The resonant power allows you to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Read Aura|read aura]] as arcane innate spells at will.

## Aeon Stone (Orange Prism)<span class="item-type">Item 16</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 9,750 gp
An _orange prism aeon stone_ must be activated to provide a benefit. The resonant power grants you a +2 item bonus to Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion checks—whichever corresponds to the tradition of the last spell you enhanced with this _aeon stone_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision ; **Effect** If your next action is to Cast a Spell, that spell’s level is 1 higher (maximum 10th level) for the purposes of counteracting and being counteracted.

## Aeon Stone (Pale Lavender Ellipsoid)<span class="item-type">Item 13</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 2,200 gp
This aeon stone must be activated to provide a benefit. The resonant power allows you to cast the [[DATABASE/spell/Read Aura|read aura]] cantrip as an arcane innate spell.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** A spell targets you; **Effect** The stone casts a 6th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] spell in an attempt to counteract the triggering spell, with a counteract modifier of +22. This can be used only on spells that specifically target you—not area spells that don’t have targets. If it succeeds, it counteracts the spell for all targets if other creatures were targeted in addition to you. Each time you activate this _aeon stone_, attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the stone permanently turns into a _dull gray aeon stone_.

## Aeon Stone (Pink Rhomboid)<span class="item-type">Item 12</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 1,900 gp
When you invest this stone, you gain 15 temporary Hit Points. If the stone’s effects are suppressed, you lose any of the temporary Hit Points remaining until it returns. The temporary Hit Points refresh during your daily preparations; they do not refresh if you re-invest the stone, or invest another _pink rhomboid aeon stone_, before then.
 The resonant power allows you to cast the [[DATABASE/spell/Stabilize|stabilize]] cantrip as a divine innate spell.

## Aeon Stone (Tourmaline Sphere)<span class="item-type">Item 7</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 350 gp
When you would die from the dying condition (typically at dying 4), this _aeon stone_ automatically activates and reduces your dying value to 1 less than would normally kill you (typically to dying 3). The stone then permanently turns into a _dull gray aeon stone_. You can benefit from this ability only once per day, even if you have multiple such stones.
 The resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] as a divine innate spell once per day.

## Aeon Stone (Black Pearl)<span class="item-type">Item 12</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/World Guide|World Guide]] 
**Price** 2,000 gp
**Usage** worn
This black pearl sparkles with light. The resonant power allows you to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Sending|sending]] once per day. 
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** you are targeted by a mental effect; **Effect** You receive a +4 status bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect. Whether or not your save is successful, the aeon stone attempts a counteract check at +30 to immediately reflect a copy of the effect back at the originator, targeting it using the creature’s own relevant statistics but controlling the effect as if you had cast it. 
 Every time you activate this aeon stone, attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the stone shatters and loses its magical properties forever.

PFS Note_ All characters affiliated with the Pathfinder Society have access to this item_
**Price** 40,000 gp
**Usage** worn
**Access** Member of the Pathfinder Society.
The first time each day you die, your vital and spiritual essences mingle together and reside within this _aeon stone_. You have a limited sense of how many life forces are currently within 30 feet of the stone, which you can potentially use to determine when it's safe to call on the stone's power. At any time within the next hour after your body died, you can spend 1 minute concentrating in order to return to your body. As long as your body is still intact, you are no longer dead— you are restored to 1 HP with the [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 3]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Wounded|wounded 3]] conditions. You can benefit from the effects of only one _pale orange rhomboid aeon stone_ in a given day.
 The resonant power allows you to wait more than an hour to return to your body with the _aeon stone_; as long as the _wayfinder_ remains on the body, your body doesn't decay and you can return at any point.

**Price** 90 gp
**Usage** worn
This clear quartz stone appears to have been smashed and then repaired by pouring molten copper into the cracks and fitting the shards back together using the copper as a sort of mortar. When a non-magical item in your possession with a value of 90 gp or less and a Bulk of 1 Bulk or less would become [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], this _aeon stone_ automatically activates, preventing the item from breaking by restoring the item's current Hit Points to the item's maximum Hit Points. The stone then turns permanently into a _dull gray aeon stone_.
 The stone's resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Mending|mending]] as a divine innate spell once per day.
