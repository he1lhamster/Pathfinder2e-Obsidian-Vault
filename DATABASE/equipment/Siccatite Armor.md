# Siccatite Armor<span class="item-type">Item 12+</span>

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor

---
Siccatite armor must be fitted with protective undercoats for it to be safely donned, making it heavier than other types of armor; add 1 Bulk to the armor's typical weight. When wearing cold siccatite armor, you're protected from severe and extreme environmental heat, and when wearing hot siccatite armor, you're protected from severe and extreme environmental cold. An opponent that has you [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] with its body while you're wearing standard-grade siccatite armor takes 4 energy damage at the end of its turn (either fire or cold, for hot and cold siccatite armor respectively), or 6 damage for a high-grade siccatite armor.
