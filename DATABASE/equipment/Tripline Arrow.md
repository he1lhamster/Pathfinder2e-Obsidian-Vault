This arrow unspools a line of wire as its flies at its target. The wire animates as it hits a target and attempts to wrap around its legs before vanishing a moment later. If you can apply the bow's critical specialization effect, you can choose to knock the target [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] instead of pinning the target. If you cannot apply the bow's critical specialization effect, you can instead attempt to use the arrow to [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] with the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] skill as if the bow had the trip weapon trait. The arrow's unwieldy nature halves its weapon's range increment.
