**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 1

Viciously sharp spiked chains wrap around this [[DATABASE/armor/Studded Leather Armor|studded leather armor]] that can be used to magically harm the wearer and channel supernatural abilities without somehow tearing at the leather itself.
 The _barbed vest_ doesn't fuse to you in the usual way (see Cursed Items). It can be removed and discarded, but 1 day after doing so, you feel driven to recollect the vest at any cost until the curse is removed with a [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Curse|remove curse]] spell.
 Anytime you activate the _barbed vest_, its chains tighten around you, dealing 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent piercing damage]]. You can remove this persistent damage as normal, but only after deactivating the item's magic as a single action.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The _barbed vest_ casts [[DATABASE/spell/Spiritual Weapon|spiritual weapon]], summoning a [[DATABASE/weapon/Spiked Chain|spiked chain]] to fight for you.
