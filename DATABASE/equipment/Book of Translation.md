The book is leather-bound and decorated with the symbol of the Lantern Lodge. Red and gold cords wrap around the book and tie to keep it shut. Each volume offers translation for a different language. When working with a book of translation, you can attempt [[Diplomacy]] checks to [[Gather Information]] or to [[Make an Impression]] with creatures that speak the language featured in the book, even if you do not speak the language. Such checks take 10 times longer to complete and you take a –2 circumstance penalty to the check due to your limited communication capabilities.
