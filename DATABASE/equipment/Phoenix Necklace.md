**Usage** worn necklace; **Bulk** —

This brilliant jewelry is made from fine silver interwoven with a uniquely malleable form of ruby that causes the necklace to glimmer like a flickering fire. Hao Jin created the necklaces to mitigate the potential of death during the Ruby Phoenix Tournament pre-qualifier, and she specially attuned each _phoenix necklace_ to the silver feathers she created for the pre-qualifying round. While the silver feathers themselves aren't magical, they are required to activate the necklace's power. Each team starts with 3 feathers hidden in their headquarters; they acquire more through challenges and events. Additionally, the tournament emissary's enforcers have the ability to deliver messages to the necklace's wearer at any time by casting [[Sending]], though the wearer can't respond.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command, envision ; **Effect** You select any number of willing creatures you can see within 30 feet, including yourself. The selected creatures can make nonlethal attacks without taking a penalty to their attack rolls. This effect remains in place until you remove the necklace or use this activation again.
**Activate** 10 minutes (envision, Interact) ; **Effect** The necklace consumes one of the attached silver feathers and casts 7th-level [[Raise Dead]]. Activating this ability is particularly costly and every activation requires consuming one more silver feather than the previous activation.
**Destruction** Once a _phoenix necklace_ has 10 silver feathers attached, Hao Jin can transform the necklace into a [[Phoenix Fighting Fan]], a process which requires 3 Interact actions.
