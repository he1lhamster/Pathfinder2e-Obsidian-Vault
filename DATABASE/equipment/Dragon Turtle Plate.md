This harness of _+1 [[Resilient]] [[Half Plate]]_ is made from the shell plates of a [[Dragon Turtle]] and has the aquadynamic trait. Fashioned from organic material, the suit is one of the few heavy armors not anathema to [[Druid]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Trigger** A creature adjacent to you targets you with a melee attack; **Effect** You roll the hefty plates of the dragon turtle armor toward the attacker to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the shell of a dragon turtle.
