Both beaded bracelets in this pair have an even larger bead in their center. The bracelets are magically linked and only interact with their counterpart from the same pair. When you crush the largest bead to activate the bracelet, it creates a mental alert in the mind of the wearer of the paired bracelet. This alert works at any distance as long as both bracelets are on the same plane.
