A _spirit trap_ consists of a net dipped in water that has been steeped with sacred herbs to better combat phantoms. This snare's components function as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Net|net]] when not set up. You set this snare up in a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. The first creature with the _spirit trait_ that steps into the area must attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** The creature is immobilized until it [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]] (DC 16).
