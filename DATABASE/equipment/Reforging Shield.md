This [[Steel Shield]] contains a smoldering core of magma that never cools. Whenever the _reforging shield’s_ current Hit Points are below its Break Threshold, the shield recovers 5 Hit Points at the start of its wielder’s turn each round until it is no longer [[Broken]]. Each time a character [[Repair]] the shield, the shield recovers double the number of Hit Points. The shield has Hardness 15, HP 120, and BT 60.
