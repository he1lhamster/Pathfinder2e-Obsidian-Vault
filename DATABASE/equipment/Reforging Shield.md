This [[DATABASE/shield/Steel Shield|steel shield]] contains a smoldering core of magma that never cools. Whenever the _reforging shield’s_ current Hit Points are below its Break Threshold, the shield recovers 5 Hit Points at the start of its wielder’s turn each round until it is no longer [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]]. Each time a character [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repairs]] the shield, the shield recovers double the number of Hit Points. The shield has Hardness 15, HP 120, and BT 60.
