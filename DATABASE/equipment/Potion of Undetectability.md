Drinking this dull-black liquid makes you undetectable to divinations. This grants the same effects as [[DATABASE/spell/Mind Blank|mind blank]], but without the bonus against mental effects. You also gain the effects of a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Invisibility|invisibility]] spell, which protects against [[DATABASE/spell/See Invisibility|see invisibility]] spells of 8th level and lower and has a DC of 36 against [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]]. The potion’s effects last for 10 minutes.
