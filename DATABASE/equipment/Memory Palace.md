A _memory palace_ is an elaborate magical structure that safely stores memories for easy access. It appears to be a miniature Taldan villa small enough to fit in the palm of a human hand.
**Activate** (10 minutes) envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The miniature grows into a building connected to the [[Astral Plane]] for 1 hour. The _memory palace_ has a 30-foot-square central courtyard surrounded by 12 10-foot-square chambers. Arranged within these chambers are various items referred to as the palace's nodes—statues, tapestries, fountains, and other works of art are common, but a node can take other forms at the GM's discretion. As a 10-minute activity, you can imprint one extended memory onto a node: the contents of a specific simple book, for example, or the events of a recent adventure. When you do, the node changes its shape and appearance to visually represent the memory you have imprinted onto it. If the node was already imprinted with a memory, the old one can be overwritten to repurpose the node.
 Memories you have imprinted on a node can be mentally accessed at any time by a creature holding the memory palace in its miniature form, regardless of who imprinted them. This grants a +2 item bonus to [[Recall Knowledge]] checks relating to details specifically occurring within the memory. What exactly qualifies is up to the GM's discretion, but a node shouldn't grant the benefits for most uses of a given skill. For example, a node dedicated to a book about trees found in the Mwangi Expanse would help with Recall Knowledge checks for such trees, but it wouldn't grant the benefits for all [[Nature]] checks to Recall Knowledge.
 A _memory palace_ node can also store the text from a [[Spellbook (Blank)]] or magical tome, but these memories aren't a substitute for having the book in your possession. A wizard can't prepare spells from a memory palace, though they could use it as source material to try to [[Learn a Spell]]. However, since storing spells in a node would only benefit someone else who later discovers the _memory palace_, few choose to take such an action. The memories contained within the nodes aren't real, and thus don't cause harmful effects, even if the source of the memory was a mental danger. Many _memory palaces_ have leftover memories from previous users—now long dead—imprinted on their various nodes.
