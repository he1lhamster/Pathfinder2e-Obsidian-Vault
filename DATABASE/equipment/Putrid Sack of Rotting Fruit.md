Each of these unassuming sacks contains enough rotting fruit to provide a fungus leshy with 1 week's worth of rations, along with clusters of stones to help press out the fruit's juices. Since their last adventure, Reaching Rings has refined their rations's ability to serve as a weapon in addition to delicious, flavorful sustenance.
 A sack of rotting fruit has a range increment of 20 feet. When you succeed at a ranged Strike on a creature by hurling a putrid sack of rotten fruit at them, the sack is consumed while the creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save.
**Success** The creature is unaffected by the foul smell of the fruit
**Failure** The creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] 1
**Critical Failure** The creature becomes sickened 2
