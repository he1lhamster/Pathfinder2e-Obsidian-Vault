In its base form, this armament looks like a smooth bar of soft, gleaming metal shaped like a horseshoe. Its ability to adjust to any battle situation makes it a popular weapon for elite warriors of the Plane of Metal. It can be shaped into a melee weapon using its [[DATABASE/equipment/Shifting|shifting]] rune, but it can shift only into weapons primarily made of metal or back to its base shape. In weapon form, it's a +_1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] shifting weapon_.
