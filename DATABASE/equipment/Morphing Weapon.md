In its base form, this armament looks like a smooth bar of soft, gleaming metal shaped like a horseshoe. Its ability to adjust to any battle situation makes it a popular weapon for elite warriors of the Plane of Metal. It can be shaped into a melee weapon using its [[DATABASE/equipment/Shifting|shifting]] rune, but it can shift only into weapons primarily made of metal or back to its base shape. In weapon form, it's a +_1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] shifting weapon_.
**Activate****—Reshape** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate); **Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Effect** Strike with the _morphing weapon_, choosing one of the following benefits to apply to the Strike.

* **Reach** Increase the reach by 5 feet.
* **Shift** The weapon's damage becomes your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing instead of its normal type.
* **Take** If the Strike hits, you can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] or [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]] from your target immediately after as a reaction.
* **Weigh** Gain a status bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon's number of damage dice.
