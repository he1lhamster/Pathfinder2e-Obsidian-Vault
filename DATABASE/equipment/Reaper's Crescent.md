The blade of this alabaster _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Sickle|sickle]]_ grows thick and pitted as the moon waxes, and it thins to a sharp sliver as the moon wanes. Moonlight also causes a second rune on the blade to change shape with the moon's phases: during the new and crescent moon, the weapon has the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] rune; during the quarter moon, the [[DATABASE/equipment/Fearsome|fearsome]] rune; and during the gibbous and full moon, the [[DATABASE/equipment/Wounding|wounding]] rune.
 When wielded under moonlight of any strength, the reaper_'s crescent_ deals additional cold damage equal to the number of damage dice.
