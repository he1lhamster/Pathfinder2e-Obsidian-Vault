This shimmering paste has many properties of a [[DATABASE/spell/Shield|shield]] spell. When you slather it onto a creature or object, the target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for 1 round. The first time a physical attack or a [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Missile|magic missile]] hits the target during that round, the oil prevents 5 damage from that attack or spell, and then the oil's effect ends.
