Granted by Katapesh's Pactmasters to influential merchants, exceptional [[Zephyr Guard]], and favorite retainers, a _pactmaster's grace_ is a crystal-studded blue platinum ring that sharpens the wearer's urban instincts. While invested, the ring grants a +2 item bonus to saving throws while you are in an urban setting, and this increases to a +3 item bonus if you have legendary proficiency in Guild [[Lore]], Katapesh Lore, Mercantile Lore, or [[Society]]. You also gain a +3 item bonus to Mercantile Lore checks while wearing the ring, and you can attempt checks that require a proficiency rank of master in Society.
