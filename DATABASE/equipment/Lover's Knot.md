This lock of hair is wrapped around a twig twisted into the shape of a heart. Popular among many of Restov's explorers, traders, and mercenaries, often a person carries several _lover's knots_ on their person in case of emergency. While the original _lover's knots_ were specific rewards granted by a particularly flirtatious Swordlord to her favored agents, time has seen these talismans become much more widespread through southern Brevoy. When you activate a _lover's knot_, you regain 2d6 Hit Points. If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]] feat, you instead regain 2d6+7 Hit Points.
