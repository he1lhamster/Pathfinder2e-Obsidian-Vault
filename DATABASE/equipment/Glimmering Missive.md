A _glimmering missive_ sparkles as you compose it. When activated, it explodes, disintegrating into a shower of multicolored motes in a 10-foot burst from a corner of the missive's space. Creatures in the area are covered in sparkling dust that remains luminous for 1 hour. Visible creatures can't be concealed while covered by the luminous dust; any [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] creatures are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] while covered in the luminous dust, rather than being [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]].
