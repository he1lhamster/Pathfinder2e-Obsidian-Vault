Once you ingest this strongly spiced, glowing red potion, blazing wings of a [[DATABASE/monster/Phoenix|phoenix]] sprout from your back and carry you through the air. For 1 minute, you gain a [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]] speed of 40 feet. The first time each round that you Fly (including to hover in place), you shed burning feathers that deal 3d4 fire damage to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation at the end of your movement (DC 29 basic Reflex save).
