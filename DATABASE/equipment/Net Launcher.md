This wide, hollow tube is two to three feet long and fires an unattached [[DATABASE/equipment/Net|net]] at much greater range than one can be thrown. A net launcher can be wielded while propped up on your shoulder or cradled under your arm. A net must be carefully folded to be launched without tangling. Properly loading a net into a net launcher takes 1 minute. A net fired with a net launcher can target a Medium or smaller creature within 40 feet, rather than 20 feet.
