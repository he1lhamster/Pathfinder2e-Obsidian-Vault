You need these tools to create items from raw materials with the [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]] skill. Different sets are needed for different work, as determined by the GM; for example, blacksmith's tools differ from woodworker's tools. If you wear your artisan's tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them. 
You can use a set of tools with 1 hand if you're wearing them or 2 if you're holding them.
