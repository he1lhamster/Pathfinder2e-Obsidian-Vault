_The Empty Throne_ represents great loss and wisdom from those who are now gone. As long as you have _The Empty Throne_ invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] regarding individuals who are no longer alive (such as checks to learn about Taldor's historical founder, but not to learn about its current empress). This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.
