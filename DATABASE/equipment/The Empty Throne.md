_The Empty Throne_ represents great loss and wisdom from those who are now gone. As long as you have _The Empty Throne_ invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to [[Society]] and [[Lore]] checks made to [[Recall Knowledge]] regarding individuals who are no longer alive (such as checks to learn about Taldor's historical founder, but not to learn about its current empress). This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You overwhelm a target you can see within 60 feet with feelings of helplessness and loss. The creature must attempt a Will DC equal to your class DC.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target can't benefit from circumstance or status bonuses for 1 round.
**Failure** The target can't benefit from circumstance or status bonuses for 1 day, and the target's allies are unable to benefit from circumstance or status bonuses while within 15 feet of the target.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 1 week.
