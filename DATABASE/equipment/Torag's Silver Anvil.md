This portable silver anvil has a narrow hoop on one end, through which a long, sturdy chain has been strung. _[[Torag]] Silver Anvil_ can be wielded as a _+3 [[Holy]] [[Flaming]] [[Striking]] [[Silver Weapon]] [[Meteor Hammer]]_. Outside of combat, the anvil can be used with a hammer as an incredibly effective portable forge, heating up the metal to be forged without a furnace and granting a +3 item bonus to [[Crafting]] checks involving metalworking. When you use the anvil to successfully [[Repair]] a metal item, the item recovers an additional 10 Hit Points (or an additional 20 on a critical success).
