A _spell-bastion_ rune creates a reservoir of eldritch energy within the shield. A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to Cast a Spell of 3rd level or lower into the shield. The spell must take 2 actions or fewer to cast and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate effect—it's instead stored for later. When you invest a _spell-bastion_ shield, you immediately know the name and level of the stored spell. A _spell-bastion_ shield found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell of the GM's choice stored in it.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Requirements** Your _spell-bastion_ shield is storing a spell, and you have your shield raised; **Effect** You prepare to unleash the stored spell on any foe that hits you until your next turn.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command **Trigger** You use the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction against a foe that the stored spell can target; **Requirements** You have a spell stored in your _spell-bastion_ shield, and you've activated the shield since your last turn in preparation for unleashing the spell; **Effect** You unleash the stored spell, which uses the target of the triggering attack as the target of the spell. This empties the spell from the shield and allows a spell to be cast into it again.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command ; **Effect** You harmlessly expend the stored spell. This frees the shield to have a new spell cast into it.
