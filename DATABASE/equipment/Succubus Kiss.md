This rare and highly addictive drug is rumored to be created by wizards working alongside [[DATABASE/monster/Succubus (Lust Demon)|succubi]]. Taken in the form of lozenges, this drug can heighten the body's pleasure and pain stimuli as well as increase alertness, energy, and euphoria. Serious side effects that can occur include heart attack, stroke, and sudden vision and hearing loss, but these risks do little to deter users.
The save for [[DATABASE/disease/Addiction|addiction]] to succubus kiss is DC 28, and the addiction has the virulent trait.
