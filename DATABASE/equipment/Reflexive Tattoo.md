This subtle pattern of complex dots, sunbursts, and lines is difficult to make out, as it's a near match for the wearer's skin tone. Serving as a barrier facing inward, this tattoo prevents ostentatious expressions of spells that are internal to you, making them easier to hide.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact (concentrate, manipulate, metamagic) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell of 2nd level or lower that affects or targets only you, you can hide that you're casting it. This has the same effect as the [[Conceal Spell]] feat.
