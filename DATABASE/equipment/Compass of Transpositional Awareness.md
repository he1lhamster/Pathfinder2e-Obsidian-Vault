The silver face of this glass-encased compass is etched with dozens of esoteric symbols, obscure icons, and inscrutable abbreviations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> concentrate, Interact **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You point the _compass of transpositional awareness_ at an extant teleportation effect (such as a magical portal) or the site of a teleportation effect that existed within the last 1 minute (such as the space where a creature just cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dimension Door|dimension door]]). Attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] check to determine to where the effect leads or led. The DC of this check is the effect's counteract DC. On a success, you know roughly the destination of the teleportation effect (for example “the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]],” “north,” or “Avistan”). On a critical success, you ascertain the exact destination within mere feet for local effects (such as _dimension door_) or within a few miles for long-range effects (such as [[DATABASE/spell/Teleport|teleport]], [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|plane shift]], or interdimensional portals).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You use the _compass of transpositional awareness_ to triangulate your current coordinates and the coordinates of your intended destination using teleportation magic. For 1 minute, whenever you cast a teleportation spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. If the spell normally has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet.
