This diamond-shaped tent is designed for sleeping in planar environments without gravity, such as the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]]. Weights are attached at each of its six points, carefully balanced against each other to prevent the tent from leaning too far in any one direction. The tent has an anchor, which can be used to moor the tent and prevent it from floating away from the object or location it is anchored to.
