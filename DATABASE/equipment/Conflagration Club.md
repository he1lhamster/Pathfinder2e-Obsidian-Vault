It gains a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot, and the charges are attuned to the damage type matching the spell's trait. If the spell has more than one eligible trait, choose one when the charges are stored.

Each creature in a 15-foot cone takes 1d6 damage per charge stored in the club, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC or DC 19, whichever is greater.
