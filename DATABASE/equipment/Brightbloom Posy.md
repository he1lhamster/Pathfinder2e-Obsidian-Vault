Appearing as vibrant as the day they were picked, this cluster of flowers is arranged in a small spray, tied with a red satin ribbon. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 24.

* **Armor** You gain the ability to speak with flowers, as [[DATABASE/spell/Speak with Plants|speak with plants]].
* **Weapon** (disease) After you cast a plant spell by activating the posy, pollen coats your weapon. Your next Strike causes the target to be [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] on a hit (sickened 2 on a critical hit). If the creature attempts to recover, it sneezes rather than retching (rolling against the spellheart's spell DC). If you don't make a Strike by the end of your next turn, the pollen becomes inert. Plant creatures are immune.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Tanglefoot|tanglefoot]].
