Old Matsuki's private brew has quite the kick. In addition to making you tipsy, this medicinal wine works wonders in helping to recover from disease—including (ironically) drug addiction. Matsuki's medicinal wine functions as [[DATABASE/equipment/Alcohol|alcohol]], except that its saving throw is a DC 18 Fortitude save. In addition, upon drinking a dose of Matsuki's medicinal wine, you gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against diseases and poisons for 24 hours. This applies to your daily save against a disease's progression; however, the bonus doesn't apply to any checks you attempt against Matsuki's medical wine itself.
