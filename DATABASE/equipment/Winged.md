This rune is a swirling glyph on the front of the armor. A large pair of transparent, ephemeral wings floats out from the back of the armor.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You trace the rune on the front of the breastplate and the armor's ephemeral wings grow tangible, granting you a fly Speed of 25 feet or your land Speed, whichever is slower. This effect lasts for 5 minutes or until you Dismiss it. Once the effect ends, the wings disappear completely, reappearing in their ephemeral form 1 hour later.
