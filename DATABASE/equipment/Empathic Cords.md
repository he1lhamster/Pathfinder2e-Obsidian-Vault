These intracately braided lenghts of leather, twince, and ribbon can be worn around the neck. _Empathic cords_ function only with the other cord in their pair and must be crafted together. If one cord becomes broken, the other dissolves in to non-magical dust. The Price listed above is for a pair of cords. The creatures wearing a pair of _empathic cords_ can sense each other's feelings and communicate empathically, no matter how far away they are, as long as the creatures are on the same planet. 
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast [[Message]], targeting the creature wearing the matching cord. The range of this message is planetary.
