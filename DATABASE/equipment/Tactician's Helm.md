Repurposing and enchanting a helmet worn by a battlefield commander can create a _tactician's helm_, imparting knowledge of battlefield tactics that feeds off your minor victories. The helm grants you a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Warfare Lore]] checks. Also, a jewel adorns the brow of the helmet. This jewel becomes charged each time you hit a creature with an [[DATABASE/action/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]]. A _tactician's helm_ can hold up to 2 charges, and its charges reset to 0 when you invest it.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** once per hour; **Requirements** The helm's jewel is charged; **Effect** One charge in the helm's jewel expires, and you choose one of the following effects.

* **Charge!** Stride twice.
* **Move It!** You gain a +2 status bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks until the end of this turn.
* **Protect!** If you're wielding a shield, Stride to a space adjacent to an ally, then Raise your Shield.
* **Re-Arm!** Interact up to three times. Each of these actions must be used to do something on Table 6–2: Changing Equipment.
