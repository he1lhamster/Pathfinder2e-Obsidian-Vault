When tied over your eyes, this ragged strip of black linen gives you a +3 item bonus to Intimidation checks and darkvision. You can see through the blindfold, but only using darkvision.
 The first time a particular creature sees you in a day, it must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be frightened 1. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect, and your allies become immune to it after about a week.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command **Frequency** once per minute; **Trigger** You damage a creature with a Strike; **Effect** Your target is gripped by intense fear. This has the effect of a DC 37 [[Phantasmal Killer]] spell, but it is an enchantment instead of an illusion. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
