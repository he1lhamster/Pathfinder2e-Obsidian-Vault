Constructed of a flexible, white wood and with ornate, twisting designs carved into its surface, this _+2 striking composite [[DATABASE/weapon/Longbow|longbow]]_ appears to have been made by [[DATABASE/ancestry/Elf|elves]]. Sometimes when you loose an arrow, its whistling in flight sounds like a voice whispering in [[DATABASE/language/Elven|Elven]], wishing for the swift defeat of your enemies.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command ; **Effect** You swear an oath to destroy one creature you can see. For the next 7 days or until that creature is slain, your attacks with the bow against that creature deal 1d6 additional damage, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Track|Track]] that creature. Your critical hits against the target gain the bow’s critical specialization effect; if they would already do so, they instead increase the DC of the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] when critically hit to DC 20.
After you activate the bow, you can’t activate it again for 7 days. If you kill the creature you’ve sworn an oath against, the oath ends and you need to wait only 10 minutes before you can activate it again.
