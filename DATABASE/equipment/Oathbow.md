Constructed of a flexible, white wood and with ornate, twisting designs carved into its surface, this _+2 striking composite [[Longbow]]_ appears to have been made by [[Elf]]. Sometimes when you loose an arrow, its whistling in flight sounds like a voice whispering in [[Elven]], wishing for the swift defeat of your enemies.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command ; **Effect** You swear an oath to destroy one creature you can see. For the next 7 days or until that creature is slain, your attacks with the bow against that creature deal 1d6 additional damage, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Survival]] checks to [[Track]] that creature. Your critical hits against the target gain the bow’s critical specialization effect; if they would already do so, they instead increase the DC of the [[Athletics]] check to [[Escape]] when critically hit to DC 20.
After you activate the bow, you can’t activate it again for 7 days. If you kill the creature you’ve sworn an oath against, the oath ends and you need to wait only 10 minutes before you can activate it again.
