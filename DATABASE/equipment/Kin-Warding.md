A _kin-warding_ clan dagger can deflect attacks aimed at your allies. When you use the weapon’s parry trait, you can point the clan dagger at an adjacent ally instead of defending yourself, creating a shield of runes around them. The runic barrier grants your ally the weapon’s circumstance bonus to AC, but you do not gain the bonus yourself.
