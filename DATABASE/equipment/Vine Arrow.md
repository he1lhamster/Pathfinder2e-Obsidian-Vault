Leafy stalks protrude from the shaft of this rustic arrow. When an activated _vine arrow_ hits a target, the arrow’s shaft splits and grows, wrapping the target in vines. The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 2d4 rounds, or until it Escapes against a DC of 19. On a critical hit, the target is also immobilized until it Escapes.
