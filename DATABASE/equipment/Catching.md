A _catching_ rune creates a small, magical vacuum that attempts to pull weapons away from opponents. If you can attempt to [[Disarm]] as part of a [[Shield Block]], such as with the [[Disarming Block]] feat or this rune's activated ability, a catching shield grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to such Disarm attempts.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You Shield Block a melee Strike made with a held weapon; **Effect** You attempt to Disarm the creature whose attack you blocked of the weapon they attacked you with. You can do so even if you don't have a hand free.
