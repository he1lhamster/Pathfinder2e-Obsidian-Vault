A _Sairazul blue potion_ is a rich navy blue in color. Subjects of the [[DATABASE/deity/Sairazul|Crystalline Queen]] produced the potion to protect themselves from the radiation [[DATABASE/deity/Ayrzul|Ayrzul]] left behind. For the next 8 hours, your skin becomes navy blue, and you gain resistance 5 to poison damage and void damage. If you drop to 0 Hit Points due to poison or void damage, the Sairazul blue within your body reacts, healing you for 8d8 Hit Points. The resistances the potion grants then end.
