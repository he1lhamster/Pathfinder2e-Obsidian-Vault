This amulet is made from the scales of five ancient dragons. You gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and poison. If you take damage of one of these types from a dragon’s Breath Weapon, the amulet begins to glow brightly; for the next 10 minutes, your resistance against that type of damage increases to 20. If you are subjected to a dragon’s [[DATABASE/monsterability/Frightful Presence|frightful presence]], you can roll your saving throw twice and use the higher result to determine the aura’s effects. This is a fortune effect.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You exude an aura that terrifies all foes in a 60-foot radius, as the [[DATABASE/monsterability/Frightful Presence|frightful presence]] ability with a DC 34 Will save.
