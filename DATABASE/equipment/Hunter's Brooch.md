While wearing this silver religious symbol of [[DATABASE/deity/Erastil|Erastil]], you can cast the [[DATABASE/spell/Disrupt Undead|disrupt undead]] cantrip as an innate divine spell.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** By touching a weapon you wield to the symbol and uttering a plea for Erastil's steadying hand, you grant that weapon the deadly d12 trait. Against undead, the weapon instead gains the fatal d12 trait. This blessing lasts for 1 minute, until you score a critical hit with the weapon, or until you aren't wielding the weapon.
