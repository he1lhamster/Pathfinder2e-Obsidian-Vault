A _dragonslayer’s shield_ is a [[DATABASE/shield/Steel Shield|steel shield]] covered with [[DATABASE/equipment/Dragonhide Shield|dragonhide]] from a certain type of dragon, which distinguishes each shield from the others. While raised, this steel shield (Hardness 8, HP 32, BT 16) grants its circumstance bonus to Reflex saves against area effects (as well as to AC, as normal).
 While you hold the shield, it also grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Will saves against a dragon’s frightful presence ability. The shield has resistance 10 against the damage type corresponding to the type of dragon whose hide was used in its creation; this applies after reducing the damage for Hardness, so when you use Shield Block, the _dragonslayer’s shield_ takes 18 less damage from attacks of that damage type. You can use Shield Block against attacks that deal damage of that type.
