A patchwork of humanoid flesh makes up a _skinsaw mask_, which is stitched together with black silk or wire. It is distinctive for its bulbous orange eye—crafted from a magical glass bauble—and wide row of teeth. When worn, the mask amplifies your ability to sense fear in other creatures. You know the value of the [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] condition of any [[DATABASE/condition/Observed|observed]] creature, and you gain a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] frightened creatures. Whenever you deal precision damage to a frightened creature, you deal 1 additional precision damage. If you aren't evil, you are [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]] while wearing a _skinsaw mask_.
