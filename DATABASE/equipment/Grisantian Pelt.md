Highly desired for the prestige, the pelt of the grogrisant also has invaluable properties. Standard-grade items can be made from the pelt of a [[Grisantian Lion]], but high-grade items require the pelt of the [[Grogrisant]] itself.
This supernaturally tough animal skin is gold and shines in sunlight. It can be used to make any item usually made of cloth, leather, or hide. This material is immune to fire, and its Hardness is doubled against piercing or slashing damage. Up to 4 Bulk of grisantian pelt can be harvested from a single creature (this is usually more than enough for 4 suits of standard grade armor or 2 suits of high-grade armor).
