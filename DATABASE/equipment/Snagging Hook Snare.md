This snare snags a creature with its wicked metal hooks. The first creature to enter the square takes 5d8 piercing damage and 5d8 slashing damage, with a DC 27 basic Reflex save. On a critical failure, the hooks piercing its flesh make the creature [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] until it successfully [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]] (DC 27).
