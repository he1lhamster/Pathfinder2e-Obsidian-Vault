These unadorned white robes, fastened with simple brass pins in the shape of a human hand, can't be soiled or blemished. While wearing _perfected robes_, you don't need to eat, sleep, or drink, but you can if you choose to. The robes bless you with constant [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]] (+32 counteract bonus). A creature who dons these robes without earning them is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 3]], [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 3]], and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 3]] while wearing them, gaining the _true seeing_ but otherwise unable to use the robes' magic.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** If your next action is to attempt a d20 roll with which you have legendary proficiency, roll twice and take the better result. This is a fortune effect.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Avatar|avatar]], gaining the abilities for [[DATABASE/deity/Irori|Irori]].
**Destruction** If the wearer ever willingly turns from the path of self-perfection into corruption or overindulgence, their _perfected robes_ crumble to nothing.
