Made of polished wood, a _neophyte's fipple_ is a block flute enchanted to guarantee melodic sound. When you Perform a song on the fipple to Activate it, your ability modifier, proficiency bonus, and item bonus for the Performance check total +7, regardless of what they would normally be. Add other bonuses and penalties to the check normally. Once the magic is used, the fipple remains as a mundane [[Musical Instrument]].
