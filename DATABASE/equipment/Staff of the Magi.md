Sigils and runes of ancient and powerful magic cover the iron cladding on this long wooden staff. A staff of the magi is a +3 major striking staff, and when wielding it you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells.
 Voluntarily destroying a staff of the magi unleashes a truly devastating wave of arcane energy that surges out, dissipating with distance. When wielding the staff, you can break it using an Interact action. This releases a 30-foot‑burst magical explosion centered on the staff. This deals 2d10 force damage per charge remaining in the staff (DC 40 basic Reflex save), You automatically critically fail your save. The explosion continues to echo beyond the initial blast zone, dealing half as much damage to creatures beyond 30 feet but within a 60-foot burst. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly; this is a death effect.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
