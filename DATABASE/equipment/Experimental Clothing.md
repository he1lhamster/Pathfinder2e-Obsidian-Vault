Experimental clothing is custom tailored in radical, avant-garde styles by independent dressmakers, utilizing expensive or eccentric materials and unconventional patterns. At the GM's discretion, wearing experimental clothing may impart a +1 item bonus or –1 item penalty on checks to [[Make an Impression]], depending on the target's fashion sense.
