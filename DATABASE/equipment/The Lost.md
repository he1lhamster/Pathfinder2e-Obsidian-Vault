_The Lost_ symbolizes loss of identity and a life filled with emptiness. As long as _The Lost_ is invested, you gain resistance to mental damage equal to your level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** you fail a saving throw against a mental effect; **Effect** You reflexively flood your mind with emptiness, stripping away any element of identity that the mental effect might be trying to affect. Increase the result of your failed saving throw by one degree of success.
