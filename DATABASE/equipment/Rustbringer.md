The handle, chain, and spiked ball of this _+1 [[Striking]] [[Corrosive]] [[Flail]]_ are all made of iron so rusted that the weapon appears nonfunctional at first glance. On Strikes against a creature that's primarily made of metal, it gains the deadly d10 trait.
**Activate****—Rusting Disarm** <span class="action-icon">5</span> ; **Trigger** You critically succeed at a [[Disarm]] attempt with the flail against a metal weapon; **Effect** Flakes of acid-laden rust are deposited on the disarmed weapon. The weapon takes 2d6 damage, ignoring the weapon's Hardness.
