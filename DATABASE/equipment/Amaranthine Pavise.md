This [[DATABASE/shield/Tower Shield|tower shield]] (Hardness 9, HP 54, BT 27) was developed by followers of [[DATABASE/deity/Ketephys|Ketephys]], the elven god of the hunt. It's distinct for having a central ridge, and for being made from only wood and hide. Ketephys's religious symbol, a hawk rising over a silver crescent, is painted on the hide stretched across the front of the shield. Each _amaranthine pavise_ is blessed by Ketephysian priests to aid in liberating Tanglebriar and defeating the nascent demon lord [[DATABASE/monster/Treerazer|Treerazer]]. While you have the shield raised, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the innate spells and special abilities of demons. When your allies have cover from the _amaranthine pavise_, the circumstance bonus they gain from cover to Reflex saves against area effects also applies to Fortitude and Will saves against demons' area effects.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Ketephys's wrath descends upon your foes. The shield casts good [[DATABASE/spell/Divine Wrath|divine wrath]] with a DC of 27.
