A _gyroscopic stabilizer_ appears as a gold disk suspended within three rotating golden bands inside a gilded case, itself attached to a set of clamps. These clamps allow you to attach the _gyroscopic stabilizer_ to any one-handed firearm as an Interact action.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Requirements** The _gyroscopic stabilizer_ is attached to a one-handed firearm without the fatal or fatal aim traits; **Effect** The gyroscopic stabilizer begins spinning for 1 minute. While the gyroscopic stabilizer is spinning, the weapon it's attached to gains the fatal aim weapon trait with a die one size larger than its damage die (maximum d12). This allows you to wield it in two hands to grant it the fatal trait.
