**Usage** worn; **Bulk** —

---
Each of these full-face masks is made of stitched materials—often including humanoid skin—and has a single, bulbous eye. While wearing the mask, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Deception]] checks to [[Lie]] and the mask doesn't impair your vision. The mask can also be activated, with an ability based on its type.

## Secret-Keeper's Mask (Blackfingers)<span class="item-type">Item 3</span>

**Source** [[GM's Toolkit. Secret Keeper's Mask]]
**Price** 60 gp
This featureless mask is made of thin, papery skin. Its single eye is a fragile bubble of venom-filled glass.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You twist the mask's eye and peer at an object. You know whether the object is poison or has been poisoned, but you don't learn the number or type of poisons present in the object.

## Secret-Keeper's Mask (Gray Master)<span class="item-type">Item 5</span>

**Source** [[GM's Toolkit. Secret Keeper's Mask]]
**Price** 150 gp
This monochrome mask is made of tattered rags of gray and black cloth and bleached fragments of skin.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You succeed on a [[Thievery]] check to [[Steal]] an item of negligible Bulk; **Effect** You create an illusory duplicate of the item you just stole. This duplicate has the appropriate appearance and weight, but it doesn't make sounds or generate smells. The illusion vanishes after 10 minutes, or earlier if anyone examines or manipulates the illusory duplicate (such as to try to use it).

## Secret-Keeper's Mask (Father Skinsaw)<span class="item-type">Item 6</span>

**Source** [[GM's Toolkit. Secret Keeper's Mask]]
**Price** 250 gp
This mask is a patchwork of tanned skins, each with a distinctive scar. It is contorted into a caricature of a face with a leering eye.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You deal [[Persistent Damage]] to a creature; **Effect** The bleeding wound you cause is particularly mutilating. The DC of flat checks to recover from the persistent bleed damage is increased by 2, and the target creature has a –2 status penalty to [[Deception]], [[Diplomacy]], and [[Performance]] checks while it is bleeding and for 1 minute after it ceases bleeding.

## Secret-Keeper's Mask (Reaper of Reputation)<span class="item-type">Item 3</span>

**Source** [[GM's Toolkit. Secret Keeper's Mask]]
**Price** 60 gp
This mask is made of gray and black tiles sewn together. It has a messy, inky spiral over the mouth.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact (auditory, linguistic) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You touch the mask's spiral and identify a target creature within 30 feet. For the next 10 minutes, any normal speech you utter can, at your discretion, be inaudible to all creatures except the target creature, who can hear you clearly regardless of ambient sound so long as it is within 1 mile. This ability doesn't silence magical words, such as the verbal component of spellcasting or commands to activate magic items.
