A _dreamstone_ is a disc-shaped object carved with imagery or words sacred to [[DATABASE/deity/Desna|Desna]]—be it her religious symbol, a short prayer, or merely the shape of a single star. When you carry a _dreamstone_, you find it easier to fall asleep, and you gain improved effects from the resulting rest. You always fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down with the intention of sleeping, and you require only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep, provided you have carried the _dreamstone_ for at least 24 hours prior to resting. As long as you carry a _dreamstone_, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against sleep effects.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact (metamagic) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell of 4th level or lower that has the sleep trait or is associated with dreams, the spell slot is not expended.

A _dreamstone_ can become cursed if left exposed to creatures that corrupt sleep, generate nightmares, or otherwise prey on sleeping or dreaming victims via supernatural methods. A _cursed dreamstone_ seems to function as a normal _dreamstone_ until the bearer falls asleep or is forced to attempt a saving throw against a sleep effect. At this point, the person carrying the cursed _dreamstone_ must attempt a DC 26 Will save to resist the curse’s effects.
**Critical Success** The character resists the curse entirely and experiences a vivid dream while sleeping that warns them of the nature of the _cursed dreamstone_.
**Success** The character resists the curse.
**Failure** As long as the cursed character possesses the stone, they are fatigued whenever they wake from sleep, whether natural or magically induced, and they take a –2 item penalty to all saving throws against sleep effects instead of gaining the normal bonus from a _dreamstone_.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and whenever the bearer attempts a saving throw against a sleep effect, they get the outcome that is one degree worse than the result of their saving throw.
