Prayer beads given prolonged exposure to spiritual energies at sacred [[DATABASE/deity/Sarenrae|Sarenite]] sites can attain sapience as _Dawnflower beads_. Other such objects hold the spirits of Sarenite priests who dedicated themselves to their work beyond death. _Dawnflower beads_ function as [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy Prayer Beads|greater holy prayer beads]]. They don't re-attune to other deities but allow any good or neutral divine spellcaster to use them, though they attempt to talk their wielder out of morally questionable acts. Add [[DATABASE/spell/Positive Luminance|positive luminance]] to the beads' spell list, available to be cast once per day. Dawnflower beads also have the following activation.
