This arrow is made of polished animal horn, with the head of a rhinoceros carved in place of a traditional arrowhead. When an activated _rhino shot_ is fired, the ethereal form of a large rhinoceros takes shape around the projectile. On a successful Strike, the attack deals an additional 2d6 force damage, and the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. If the hit with the _rhino shot_ was a critical success, the target is knocked prone unless it critically succeeds at its save.
