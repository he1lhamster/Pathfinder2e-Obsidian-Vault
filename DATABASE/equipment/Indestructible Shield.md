An _indestructible shield_ is a [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Shield|high-grade adamantine]] [[DATABASE/shield/Steel Shield|shield]] (Hardness 13, HP 90) that can withstand just about any damage. It can be damaged only by a [[DATABASE/spell/Disintegrate|disintegrate]] spell (roll damage as if against a creature that failed its save) or by an artifact tied to destruction, such as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]].
**Craft Requirements** The raw materials must include at least 4,400 gp of adamantine.
