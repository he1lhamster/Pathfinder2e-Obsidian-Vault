Geometric precision and perfect angles signify that an artist with exemplary knowledge of [[Dwarf]] tattooing traditions created this body art. Your family's ancestral stories, recited throughout the tattooing process, bind your blood even tighter to theirs. During your daily preparations, you manifest a visitation by an ancestor—possibly via a dream, a vision, or a magical trinket left by your bedroll. Roll 2d20 and record the highest result. Then roll 1d6 and note a type of saving throw: 1–2 Fortitude, 3–4 Reflex, and 5–6 Will.
 In addition, until the next visitation, you gain a +1 item bonus to one [[Lore]] skill related to the ancestor, as determined by the GM. Usually, the ancestor provides a kind of knowledge they believe you'll need. For dwarven ancestors, the Lore skill is usually Architecture Lore, Engineering Lore, Genealogy Lore, Labor Lore, Mining Lore, Warfare Lore, or Lore about a dwarven deity.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision (fortune) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You rolled a saving throw of the noted type; **Effect** Replace the roll with the d20 roll from your ancestor's visitation.
