When displayed prominently, this brass badge makes creatures find you more agreeable. You gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Recall Knowledge **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Attempt a DC 20 check to Recall Knowledge about people of a human ethnicity, a non-human ancestry, or some other type of creature. (The GM determines what your options are.) If you succeed, the badge’s bonus increases to +2 for Diplomacy checks with creatures of that group for the rest of the day.
