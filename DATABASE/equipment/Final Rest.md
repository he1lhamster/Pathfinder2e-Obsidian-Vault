This _+3 [[Disrupting]] [[Striking]] [[Silver Weapon]] [[Longsword]]_ is made from the purest silver. The blade is carefully etched to depict a vast and sprawling necropolis, a place where the dead are laid to rest. Whenever you critically hit an undead creature with _final rest_, the undead creature takes 3d6 [[Persistent Damage]], with a DC 36 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** No effect.
**Success** The creature takes half the persistent good damage.
**Failure** The creature is [[Stunned]] and takes the full persistent good damage.
**Critical Failure** The creature is stunned 3 and takes double the persistent good damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You hold the sword aloft, making it cast [[Sunburst]] (DC 38 Reflex save).
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include 4,950 gp of [[Silver]].
