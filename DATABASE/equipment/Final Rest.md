This _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|greater disrupting]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|silver]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_ is made from the purest silver. The blade is carefully etched to depict a vast and sprawling necropolis, a place where the dead are laid to rest.

**Critical Failure** The creature is stunned 3 and takes double the persistent good damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You hold the sword aloft, making it cast [[DATABASE/spell/Sunburst|sunburst]] (DC 38 Reflex save).
