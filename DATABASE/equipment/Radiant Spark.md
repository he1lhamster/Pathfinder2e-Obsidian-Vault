This shining prism is bound within a golden frame. The bright glow within the artifact is the gleaming essence of celestials bound within it in ancient times. Each activation consumes a bit of this celestial energy, projecting the screams of the celestials into your mind. While holding the _Radiant Spark_, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against divine spells and effects and you are aware of its powers. If you are good, while holding the _Radiant Spark_, you are [[Sickened]] and can't recover from this condition.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact ; **Effect** The _Radiant Spark_ casts a 10th-level [[Dominate]] spell (DC 49) on a creature that isn't from the [[Material Plane]]. Celestials get an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their save.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Trigger** You begin casting a [[Planar Binding]] ritual; **Effect** The _Radiant Spark_ reduces the casting time of the ritual to 1 hour, and you don't need secondary casters for this ritual.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision, Interact **Trigger** The target critically fails their save against the _Radiant Spark's_ _dominate_ spell or you critically succeed at binding the target with the _planar binding_ ritual using the artifact; **Effect** The target must attempt a DC 49 Will save and is immune to further attempts for 24 hours.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[Drained]].
**Failure** The target dies and its essence is trapped within the _Radiant Spark_. It can be brought back to life only with powerful magic such as [[Wish]] or [[Miracle]].
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target can't be brought back to life until the _Radiant Spark_ is destroyed.
**Destruction** An archfiend or evil demigod must willingly swap their essence with that of a celestial dominated or bound by the artifact, then critically fail the saving throw against having their essence consumed. This permanently destroys both the artifact and the fiend or demigod.
