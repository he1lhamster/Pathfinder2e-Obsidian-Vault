This _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Resilient|greater resilient]] [[DATABASE/armor/Studded Leather Armor|studded leather]]_ is traditionally inscribed with a symbol of either [[DATABASE/deity/Norgorber|Norgorber]] or [[DATABASE/deity/Cayden Cailean|Cayden Cailean]]. Its leather is light as silk, and its buttons and studs are gleaming crystal. While you wear it, you get a +15-foot item bonus to your Speed, and effects that attempt to impose penalties on your Speed must first counteract the _jerkin of liberation_ or they have no effect on you.
In addition, you are hard to incapacitate. You use the jerkin's item level or your own level, whichever is higher, to determine effects of the incapacitation trait.
