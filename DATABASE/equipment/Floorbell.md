This surprisingly sturdy 3-foot-by-3-foot clay tile resembles a thick pressure plate. It can support up to 500 pounds of weight atop it before it is destroyed. The _floorbell's_ nature is obvious at a glance, but mundane or magical means can obscure or camouflage the tile (such as by covering it in scattered leaves or by casting an [[Illusory Object]] spell) to make it harder to detect.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact ; **Effect** The _floorbell_ must be activated on level ground. When you do, specify the amount of weight that triggers the _floorbell's_ alarm system. When the amount of weight you specify (or more) is placed on the _floorbell_, it emits an ear-piercing wail clearly audible to a range of 150 feet. A _floorbell_ can also ring an alarm if a weight you specify is removed from the _floorbell_, such as if you activated it while a heavy sack was on it.
