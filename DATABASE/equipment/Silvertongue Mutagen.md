Your features become striking and your voice becomes musical and commanding, though facts and figures become hazy for you and emotion clouds your ability to reason.
 **Benefit** You gain an item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]], [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]], and [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks. Your critical failures with any of these skills become failures instead.
 **Drawback** You take a –2 item penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]], and [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] checks. Choose one skill in which you are trained; for the duration, you become untrained in that skill. All your failures on checks to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] become critical failures.
