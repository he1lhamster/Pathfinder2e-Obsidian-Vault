First developed in the Puddles about 20 years ago, this stimulant has grown from a diversion of the wretched poor to a habit for well- heeled merchants and nobles. At low doses, grit provides the physical body with increased energy while stimulating the idle mind into effortless flights of creative fancy. Abuse of the drug leads to severe hallucinations, numbing, and uncontrollable rage. Grit is produced by grinding down alchemically-enhanced barbarian chew, which is mixed with toxic plant- based substances, such as bitterbark or redroot. The powder is very expensive and highly addictive.
The save for addiction to grit is DC 15, and the addiction has the virulent trait.
