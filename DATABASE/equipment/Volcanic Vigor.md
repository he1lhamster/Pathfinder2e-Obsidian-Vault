This tattoo takes the shape of a muscular [[Orc]], with molten flesh and hollow eye sockets that seep smoke. You don't take damage from extreme heat or severe heat. 
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You stomp on the ground, causing a 5-foot radius, 30- foot tall cylinder of lava to erupt from the ground within a range of 30 feet. The cylinder deals 7d6 fire damage. All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 27 basic Reflex save.

The damage of your lava eruption increases to 12d6, the range increases to 60 feet, and you can choose to increase the radius of the cylinder to 10 feet. Similarly, the height of the cylinder increases to 60 feet, and the DC increases to 34. While exposed to incredible heat, you take only minor heat damage every hour, instead of moderate heat damage every minute. You can see through ash and smoke.
