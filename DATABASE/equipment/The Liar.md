_The Liar_ represents obsession or treacherous love. As long as you have _The Liar_ invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to [[Deception]] checks to [[Lie]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you're at least 17th level. If the implausibility of your lies prompts a circumstance penalty to your Deception checks or an increase to your Deception DC, reduce that penalty or increase by half.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You touch a weapon and instill faithlessness within it. The weapon gains the [[Backbiting]]. The curse lasts until you use this activation again. If you're at least 17th level, you can instead use this activation on a weapon within 30 feet. If the weapon is carried by a creature, it can resist the effect with a successful Will save against your class DC.
