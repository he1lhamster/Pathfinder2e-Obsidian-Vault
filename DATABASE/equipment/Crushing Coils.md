Made from constrictor snakeskin, the strips of this _+1 [[DATABASE/armor/Leather Armor|leather armor]]_ wrap around you like an anaconda might wrap around its victim. The first time you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check after donning the armor, it fuses with you and constricts. It constricts anytime you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check thereafter. When the armor constricts, you're [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] for 1 round.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command, Interact ; **Effect** The armor wraps around you, allowing you to don it by the time the activation finishes.
