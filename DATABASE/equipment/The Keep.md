_The Keep_ represents steadfastness and being unshakable to threats. As long as _The Keep_ is invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects. Whenever you become [[Frightened]], reduce the condition value by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If you are 20th level, the item bonus increases to +3.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast [[Magnificent Mansion]]. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 7th level), and the interior of the mansion appears to be the inside of a resplendent keep made of stone.
