Crafted from black iron, this crude suit of _+2 resilient [[DATABASE/armor/Full Plate|full plate]]_ is designed to make you look like a horned demon, with your face peering out of the screaming maw of the beast.
While wearing the armor, you can attack with the helmet’s horns. They are a martial melee weapon with the effects of a _+2 weapon potency rune_. They deal 2d8 piercing damage and have the deadly d12 trait. On a critical hit with the horns, the target must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save against the [[DATABASE/spell/Abyssal Plague|Abyssal plague disease]]. The horns can’t be etched with any runes. 
 If you aren’t evil, you’re drained 2 and can’t recover from this condition while wearing _demon armor_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dimension Door|dimension door]].
**Craft Requirements** You are evil; supply one casting of _dimension door_.
