A blade launcher has a bow-like assembly mounted on a handled frame. The frame can be configured to fire either a [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Dart|dart]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Shuriken|shuriken]], or [[DATABASE/weapon/Starknife|starknife]]. Configuring a blade launcher requires three Interact actions. Once properly configured, loading an appropriate thrown weapon into a blade launcher requires a single Interact action. A blade launcher can't fire weapons for which it's not currently configured. A weapon fired with a blade launcher loses the agile, monk, thrown, and versatile traits, if it has them, and has a range increment of 40 feet. Due to losing the thrown weapon trait, [[DATABASE/equipment/Returning|returning]] and most other effects that allow a weapon to return don't function; even if a launched weapon did return, you'd still need to load it into the blade launcher with an Interact action to fire the blade launcher again.
