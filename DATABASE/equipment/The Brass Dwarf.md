The _Brass Dwarf_ represents invulnerability. When you invest _The Brass Dwarf_, you gain resistance to fire equal to your level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, mental, poison, or sonic. You can't choose the damage type for which _The Brass Dwarf_ currently gives you resistance. You gain resistance to the damage you chose equal to your level, and you lose the prior resistance that _The Brass Dwarf_ gave you. For 1 minute, you gain weakness equal to half your level to the damage type of the prior resistance.
