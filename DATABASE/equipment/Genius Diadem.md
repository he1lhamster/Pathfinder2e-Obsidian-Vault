The _genius diadem_ is a [[Diadem of Intellect]] that typically acts like an arrogant professor or mentor, often boasting that it is a certified greater intellect and far superior to your own intelligence, even after the benefits the diadem grants you. The _genius diadem_ encourages you to learn things for yourself rather than actually attempting to [[Recall Knowledge]] for you, though you or your allies might be able to play on its arrogance using [[Deception]] to trick it into doing so. In addition to allowing you to activate it, the diadem can use the _diadem of intellect’s_ [[Hypercognition]] activation with its own actions, though if it does so, the diadem gains the benefits instead of you. Only the diadem can use the following activation.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The _genius diadem_ casts 7th-level [[Feeblemind]].
