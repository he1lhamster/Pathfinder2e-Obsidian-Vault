These manacles are nearly indistinguishable from real manacles upon inspection, but contain a hidden release that enables a wearer who knows the location of the release to free themselves with a single Interact action. An observer who examines the manacles and succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check notices their false nature. On a critical success, the observer finds the location of the hidden catch as well.
