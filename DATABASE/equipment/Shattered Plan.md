Though the body of this _+2 [[Striking]] [[Impactful]] [[Boomerang]]_ is riddled with glowing hairline cracks, the weapon feels reassuringly solid in the hand. If you damage a target that has been struck by a _[[Rime Foil]]_ within the last round, you bruise its chilled body, and the target takes a –5-foot penalty to all its Speeds, or a –10-foot penalty on a critical hit.
 **Special** The _shattered plan_ pairs with the _rime foil_.
