Though the body of this _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Impactful|impactful]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Boomerang|boomerang]]_ is riddled with glowing hairline cracks, the weapon feels reassuringly solid in the hand. If you damage a target that has been struck by a _[[DATABASE/equipment/Rime Foil|rime foil]]_ within the last round, you bruise its chilled body, and the target takes a –5-foot penalty to all its Speeds, or a –10-foot penalty on a critical hit.
 **Special** The _shattered plan_ pairs with the _rime foil_.
