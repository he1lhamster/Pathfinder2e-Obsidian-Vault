Script in a language of the Outer Planes adorns this book's spine, and a deity's symbol is etched on its cover. _Books of warding prayers_ are each devoted to a particular deity and are also a [[DATABASE/equipment/Religious Symbol|religious symbol]] of that deity.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** Your last action was to cast a prepared divine spell granted by your deity; **Effect** Choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; you can't choose a type that's part of your deity's alignment. You and all allies within 30 feet are suffused with your deity's protection, gaining resistance 10 to damage of that type for 1 minute.
