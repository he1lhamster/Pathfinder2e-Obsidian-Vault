The blade of this _+2 [[Striking]] [[Dagger]]_ is etched with whirling portals, and a single blue sapphire adorns its hilt. It feels lightweight and is always slightly warm to the touch.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast [[Dimension Door]]. The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with puffs of smoke that make anyone within [[Concealed]] until they leave the smoke or until the end of your next turn, at which point the smoke dissipates. When used in strong winds, the smoke disperses immediately.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** Your melee attack roll with the _blink blade_ is a critical success; **Effect** You and your target teleport to a space within 10 feet. The target arrives in a safe, open space of your choosing adjacent to your arrival space. This teleportation also creates puffs of smoke, as noted with the activation above.
