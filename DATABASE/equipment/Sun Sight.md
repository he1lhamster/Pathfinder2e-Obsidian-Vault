Placed under the eyes like rays of light, this tattoo burns away illusions with the unmerciful brilliance of the sun. You gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks that involve sight. If you're [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]], you receive a new save at the start of each of your turns to end your dazzled condition.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> to <span class="action-icon">3</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The tattoo casts a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Scorching Ray|scorching ray]], with the rays emitting from your eyes. The number of actions you spend Activating the tattoo determines _scorching ray's_ number of rays. The tattoo also attempts to dispel each illusion on a creature hit by a ray (counteract level 5th, counteract modifier +19).
