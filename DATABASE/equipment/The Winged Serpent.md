_The Winged Serpent_ represents the wisdom of knowing when to act. As long as you have _The Winged Serpent_ invested, you gain a +2 item bonus on initiative checks made with sight-based Perception checks. This bonus increases to +3 if you are 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You swipe _The Winged Serpent_ across your eyes to gain insight on when to strike. You cast [[Foresight]] on yourself, but the duration is only 10 minutes. If you're at least 17th level, the duration extends to 1 hour and you can cast _foresight_ on another creature by touch. The level of this spell is one-half your level rounded down (minimum 9th).
