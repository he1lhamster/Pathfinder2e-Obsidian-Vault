This _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dueling Pistol|dueling pistol]]_ is fashioned from silvery steel that glistens with a radiant light. You can choose to make a nonlethal attack with the _redeemer's pistol_ without taking a –2 penalty; if you do so, the attack deals 1d6 additional mental damage. You can also call forth the redemptive spirit within the gun to pass judgment on your foes.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** An enemy within 30 feet damages you; **Effect** The protective spirit within the gun imposes a vision of redemption in your foe's mind. The foe must choose one of the following options.

* You're unharmed by the triggering damage.
* You gain resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. After the damaging effect is applied, the enemy becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] until the end of its next turn and takes 4 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent good damage]].
