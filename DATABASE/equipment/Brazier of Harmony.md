The _brazier of harmony_ is a circular, orb-shaped censer etched with celebrating creatures shaking hands and dancing. The brazier contains a pleasant-smelling potpourri of dried flowers and incenses, designed to create a calm atmosphere that encourages meditation, thoughtfulness, and camaraderie. While holding the lit censer, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks, whether the censer is activated or not.
**Activate****—Light Incense** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (aura, manipulate); **Cost** incense worth at least 1 sp; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** When the incense is lit, pleasant, floral smoke surrounds the censer in a 20-foot emanation, creating a space of peace and harmony. Each creature that breathes the smoke is affected by 3rd-rank [[Calm Emotions]] and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. The spell's effects end when the incense burns out.
