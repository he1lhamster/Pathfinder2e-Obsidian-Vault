Instead of chain links, this _+1 [[DATABASE/armor/Chain Shirt|chain shirt]]_ is assembled from metal “leaves” that each resemble a small blade.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You pull a link from the armor, which transforms into a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_. The dagger disappears and reappears as a link in the armor after you Strike with it, or at the end of this turn if you don't make a Strike. You can Activate the blade byrnie in place of an Interact action to draw a weapon for abilities such as the [[DATABASE/feat/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]] feat.
 Upgrading the runes on the _blade byrnie_ makes the daggers pulled from it more powerful. The daggers have a [[DATABASE/equipment/Weapon Potency|+2 weapon potency]] rune if the armor has a [[DATABASE/equipment/Armor Potency|+2 armor potency]] rune, or a _+3 weapon potency_ rune if the armor has a _+3 armor potency_ rune.
