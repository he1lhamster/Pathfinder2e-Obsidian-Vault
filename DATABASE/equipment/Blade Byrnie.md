Instead of chain links, this _+1 [[Chain Shirt]]_ is assembled from metal “leaves” that each resemble a small blade.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You pull a link from the armor, which transforms into a _+1 [[Striking]] [[Dagger]]_. The dagger disappears and reappears as a link in the armor after you Strike with it, or at the end of this turn if you don't make a Strike. You can Activate the blade byrnie in place of an Interact action to draw a weapon for abilities such as the [[Quick Draw]] feat.
 Upgrading the runes on the _blade byrnie_ makes the daggers pulled from it more powerful. The daggers have a [[Weapon Potency]] rune if the armor has a [[Armor Potency]] rune, or a _+3 weapon potency_ rune if the armor has a _+3 armor potency_ rune.
