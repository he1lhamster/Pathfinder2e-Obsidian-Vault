Dragon teeth line the edges of this _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Leiomano|leiomano]]_. The leiomano also has a [[DATABASE/equipment/Flaming|flaming]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost|frost]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Shock|shock]], or [[DATABASE/equipment/Corrosive|corrosive]] rune, as appropriate for the dragon from which the teeth were taken, which also grants the weapon the associated energy trait (for instance, fire for a club made with teeth taken from a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Red|red dragon]]).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact ([[DATABASE/equipment/Cat|evocation]], magical) **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You swing the leiomano, sending several of the dragon teeth shooting through the air on jets of energy. The dragon teeth deal 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 damage of the energy type corresponding to the weapon in a 15-foot cone (DC 29 basic Reflex save). The teeth hunt down their targets, correcting their flight in midair, which reduces any circumstance bonus from cover by 2.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include teeth from a dragon with a breath weapon that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage.
