This traveler's chair uses magic and Stasian technology, storing up power in its Stasian coils to arc lightning through your foes and grant brief spurts of flight.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact (electricity, evocation, magical); **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You create a ball of electricity around the chair, surrounding it in a damaging aura of electricity and using electromagnetism to briefly levitate. For 1 minute, you gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed and adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that touch or hit you with an unarmed attack, take 2d6 electricity damage each time. As normal, this applies to creatures who choose to touch you, not when you touch or attack another creature.
