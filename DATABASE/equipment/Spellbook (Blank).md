A spellbook holds the written knowledge necessary to learn and prepare various spells, a necessity for [[DATABASE/class_/Wizard|wizards]] (who typically get one for free) and a useful luxury for other spellcasters looking to learn additional spells. Each spellbook can hold up to 100 spells. The Price listed is for a blank spellbook.
