Frightened animals depicted on this fulu flee in all directions from a central figure (traditionally represented by a human hunter, but sometimes depicted as a skeletal undead creature or even a fiend with long, broken arms). You activate this fulu, gaining a +2 item bonus to AC against the triggering Strike. If this causes the Strike to miss, you become [[Concealed]] from the triggering creature until the start of your next turn.
