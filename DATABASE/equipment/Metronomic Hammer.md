A polished brass metronome ticks rhythmically within the haft of this _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Gnome Hooked Hammer|gnome hooked hammer]]_. Gnome adherents of [[DATABASE/deity/Brigh|Brigh]] often attempt to reproduce this item as part of a ritual symbolizing methodical problem-solving and thoughtful craftsmanship.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** You attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] a creature with the _metronomic hammer_; **Effect** By timing the sweeping arcs of your Trip attempt to the built-in metronome of a _metronomic hammer_, you gain a +1 item bonus to your [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to Trip the target. This item bonus increases by 1 with every subsequent Trip attempt you make with the _metronomic hammer_ against the same target this turn, to a maximum of +3 on your third Trip. The bonus resets to +1 if you successfully Trip the target, if you critically fail to Trip the target, or if your turn ends.
