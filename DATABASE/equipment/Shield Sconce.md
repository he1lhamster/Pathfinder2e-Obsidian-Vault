This carefully balanced metal bracket can be attached to the front or top of a shield or tower shield (but not a buckler), allowing you to carry a torch without giving up your shield or holding it in your other hand. While carrying a torch in this way, you must attempt a DC 11 flat check every time you use the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction; on a failure, the torch is extinguished.
