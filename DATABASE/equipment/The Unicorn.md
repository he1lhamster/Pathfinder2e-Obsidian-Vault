_The Unicorn_ represents finding what one seeks. As long as you have _The Unicorn_ invested, you gain a +2 item bonus on Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you're at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You pass _The Unicorn_ across an adjacent closed container and then open the container. Inside, you'll find a Common consumable alchemical or magic item you need to solve a problem or deal with a situation close at hand. For example, if you're badly wounded, you might find a [[DATABASE/equipment/Healing Potion|greater healing potion]]. If you've been poisoned, you could discover a [[DATABASE/equipment/Panacea|panacea]]. If you're faced with a written clue in a language you don't understand, the container might hold a [[DATABASE/equipment/Comprehension Elixir|comprehension elixir]]. The GM always decides what consumable item is discovered, and it must be equal to or lower than your level. If the consumable isn't used within 1 minute of being discovered, the item vanishes. If there's no appropriate item to solve your situation, the GM can rule that no object is found; in this case, the daily use of _The Unicorn_ is not expended.
