This long strip of linen is tightly wound around the barrel of the affixed firearm or the grip of a bow. When activated, the talisman's magic dampens the sound of the triggering shot, rendering it completely silent, and additionally skews the angle of the shot, so it appears to come from a different location and direction than your actual position. You don't become automatically observed to any creatures due to making the triggering Strike.
