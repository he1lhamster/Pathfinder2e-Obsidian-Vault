**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 156. The Apocalypse Prophet|Pathfinder #156: The Apocalypse Prophet]]
**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
**Base Weapon** [[DATABASE/weapon/Longsword|Longsword]]

The hilt of this _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|major striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Axiomatic|axiomatic]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Spell-Storing|spell-storing]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_ is simple and elegant. The blade itself is made of throneglass—a clear, jewellike crafting material with a razor-sharp edge, capable of absorbing psychic magic and redirecting it at the wielder's enemies. Whenever the _Kortos Diamond_ is in an area of dim or brighter light, it glows faintly, as if reflecting the light of a setting sun.
 While wielding the Kortos Diamond, you gain a +2 item bonus on saving throws against mental effects. You can never harm yourself with the Kortos Diamond, even if [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]].
 If you ever travel farther than 100 miles from the Isle of Kortos while in possession of the _Kortos Diamond_, the sword becomes impossibly heavy; you are [[DATABASE/condition/Encumbered|encumbered]] as long as you carry the sword and remain outside of this area. If you relinquish the _Kortos Diamond_ while away from Kortos, the sword gradually makes its way back to the isle over the course of a year.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You attempt a melee Strike with the _Kortos Diamond_ against a creature within reach. On a hit, you deal damage as normal and the target's mind is inflicted with a powerful disruptive energy. When the creature attempts to Cast a Spell, it must attempt a DC 44 Will save; on a failure, the spell fails and both the spell and the actions spent to cast it are lost. This effect lasts for up to 1 minute.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per round; **Trigger** You damage an aberration with the _Kortos Diamond_; **Effect** You deal an additional 2d8 force damage to the struck creature.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You hold the _Kortos Diamond_ aloft and proclaim your might in a booming voice. You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Overwhelming Presence|overwhelming presence]] (DC 42).
**Destruction** A deity who ascended to divinity via the Test of the Starstone can damage and destroy the _Kortos Diamond_ as if it were not an artifact.
