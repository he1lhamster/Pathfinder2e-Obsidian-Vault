Animal nip contains a mix of herbaceous, fragrant plants, ground into a coarse powder with a strong scent that attracts a broad spectrum of animals. You activate animal nip by sprinkling it on the ground or a target of your choice. For the next minute, all creatures within 30 feet that have the animal trait must attempt a Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] by the smell of the animal nip for 1 round. On a critical failure, they also fall [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] and roll about on the ground. If the target is subject to a hostile act, the fascination ends immediately. Regardless of the result of the creature's save, it's then immune to animal nip for 1 hour.
