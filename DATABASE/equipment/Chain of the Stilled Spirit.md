This 3-foot length of chain is made of a mystical blue-white steel. You can wrap the chain around an item or creature; if a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghost|ghost]] of 9th level or lower is bound to the item or creature via its rejuvenation ability, it cannot rejuvenate if it is destroyed. This chain can't impede a ghost's rejuvenation that is tied to an area, only to an item or creature. At the GM's discretion, the _chain of the stilled spirit_ might work on abilities similar to Rejuvenation that prevent a spirit from going being fully destroyed.
