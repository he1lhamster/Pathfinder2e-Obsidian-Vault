The crossbar of this _+2 greater striking [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy|holy]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Longsword|longsword]]_ is styled to look like angel wings. Tradition holds that those who see their reflection in a _holy avenger's_ highly polished blade have their faults laid bare. If you are evil, you are [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] while carrying or wielding this weapon.
