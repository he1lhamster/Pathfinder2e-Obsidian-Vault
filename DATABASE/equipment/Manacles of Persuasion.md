These sturdy, [[DATABASE/equipment/Manacles|average manacles]] are connected by a thick iron chain that is much heavier than its appearance suggests at a glance. Followers of [[DATABASE/deity/Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthon]] sometimes employ _manacles of persuasion_ against captured enemies and spies. When the manacles are locked around an [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] creature’s wrists, they begin to sap the life out of the victim, dealing 2 negative damage per hour until the creature falls [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]]. The effect is nonlethal, so the damage doesn’t cause the creature to become [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]]. While the creature is unconscious, the manacles deal no damage and allow the creature to recover Hit Points normally to a maximum of 10 Hit Points, at which point the manacles begin to deal damage once more. The manacles have no effect on a creature that is not immobilized.
