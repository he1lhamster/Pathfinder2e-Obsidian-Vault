The handles of this _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Scythe|scythe]]_ are made from a dull, gray wood of bone-like consistency, and when you slice with it, a fluttering gust of hundreds of moths' wingbeats fills the air. If you're a devotee of [[DATABASE/deity/Urgathoa|Urgathoa]], you can use this scythe as a divine focus, and with every Strike, it exudes a pallid cloud of powdery dust.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command (divine, necromancy, negative) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You deal 1d10 negative damage to yourself. If your next action is to Strike with the scythe or to Cast a Spell with the disease or negative trait, that Strike or spell deals additional negative damage equal to the damage you took (after any reductions or increases from immunity, resistances, weaknesses).
