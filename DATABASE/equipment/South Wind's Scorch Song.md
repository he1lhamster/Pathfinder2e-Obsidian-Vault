This _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Flaming|flaming]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Scimitar|scimitar]]_ is always warm to the touch, nearly unbearably so. Lines of crackling flame radiate from carnelians affixed to its curved and blackened blade, and its pommel ends in a brilliant tassel of [[DATABASE/monster/Phoenix|phoenix]] feathers. While you have a status bonus to at least one of your Speeds, your Strikes with this scimitar that deal fire damage gain a +2 status bonus to their fire damage. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a _greater striking_ rune and +4 for _major striking_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command (evocation, fire, magical) **Trigger** Your spell deals fire damage to a creature; **Effect** You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed until the end of your next turn.
