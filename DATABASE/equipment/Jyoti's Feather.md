A _jyoti's feather_ is a shimmering red and gold feather, seeming almost metallic, although delicate and flexible to the touch. Though most aren't made from true [[DATABASE/monster/Jyoti|jyoti]] feathers, as the reclusive outsiders avoid visitors from the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], their connection to positive energy lent the spellhearts their name.

* **Weapon** The weapon has the [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|disrupting]] rune while the feather is affixed.
