A _jyoti's feather_ is a shimmering red and gold feather, seeming almost metallic, although delicate and flexible to the touch. Though most aren't made from true [[Jyoti]] feathers, as the reclusive outsiders avoid visitors from the [[Material Plane]], their connection to positive energy lent the spellhearts their name.

* **Armor** You gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against death effects and negative energy.
* **Weapon** The weapon has the [[Disrupting]] rune while the feather is affixed.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You cast [[Stabilize]].
