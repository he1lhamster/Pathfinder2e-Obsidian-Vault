The name of your beloved adorns this stylized image of a heart. An _unbreakable heart_ tattoo can be received only at the end of a successful [[DATABASE/ritual/Heartbond|heartbond]] ritual, serving as your token. The other participant can have a token other than a tattoo if they wish. If you have more than one heartbond, each _unbreakable heart_ you have serves as a token for only one of them.
 The love exuding from you grants you a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks. When you use _heartbond's_ activity to learn your beloved's present state, you can also grant them a small gift, choosing from the following options each time. Make your choice after learning their state.

* Your beloved gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes.
* The tattoo casts [[DATABASE/spell/Guidance|guidance]] on your beloved.
* The tattoo casts [[DATABASE/spell/Stabilize|stabilize]] on your beloved.
* The tattoo casts [[DATABASE/spell/Light|light]] on your beloved's token from heartbond.
