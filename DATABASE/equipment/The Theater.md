_The Theater_ represents prophecy and how prophets can't change the unfolding pageantry of fate. As long as you have _The Theater_ invested and as long as you are not already [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]], when you would gain the doomed condition, attempt a DC 10 flat check. On a success, you do not gain the doomed condition.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision (fortune) **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You are targeted by a misfortune effect; **Effect** _The Theater_ attempts to counter the misfortune effect before it affects you. It has a counteract level equal to your level divided by 2 (rounded up), and a counteract modifier of your Class DC – 10.
