The magic in this rune sings in time with your attacks and coaxes you into finishing your opponent. When you critically hit a target that's taking [[Persistent Damage]], your target becomes [[Drained]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** You reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with the weapon; **Effect** You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to twice the creature's level. These Hit Points remain for 1 minute.
