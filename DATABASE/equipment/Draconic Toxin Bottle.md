This glass bottle appears to be a [[DATABASE/equipment/Dragon's Breath Potion|dragon's breath potion]] of a specific dragon type (usually red) but has been polluted, making it toxic to use.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You drink from the bottle and must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (sickened 2 on a critical failure) and immediately vomit the potion directly onto yourself, taking damage as though you had failed a save against a standard _dragon's breath potion_. If you succeed at your Fortitude save, you become sickened 1 but otherwise are able to unleash a breath weapon as normal for a _dragon's breath potion_ of the appropriate type.
