The euphemistically named saboteur's friend looks, smells, and tastes like an appetizing chocolate square. You lace the chocolate with reagents that induce a strong laxative effect. Saboteur's friend is useful for incapacitating rather than dealing lasting harm. Unlike some poisons, saboteur's friend can have its sickened condition reduced (but changing to a higher or lower stage after a save applies any sickened condition listed for that stage, as normal).
 **Saving Throw** DC 20 Fortitude; **Onset** 10 minutes; **Maximum Duration** 1 hour; **Stage 1** [[Sickened]] (10 minutes); **Stage 2** [[Enfeebled]] and sickened 2 (10 minutes); **Stage 3** enfeebled 1, [[Fatigued]], and sickened 3 (10 minutes)
