The crime lord Miogimo almost always appears with this special mask, crafted with a piece of his soul. It has two forms. In its first form, the mask depicts a silvery and angelic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as lawful good to creatures attempting to detect your alignment. In its second form, the mask depicts a gold-skinned demonic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as chaotic evil to creatures attempting to detect your alignment. If you die while wearing the mask, a fragment of your soul is trapped in the mask, forming a life link. If there was already a soul fragment in the mask when this happens, you roll a Will save against the Will DC of the person who left the previous fragment. If you succeed, your soul fragment replaces the old one. On a failure, you die normally.

**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Crisis of Faith|crisis of faith]] (DC 34), targeting up to four creatures within 30 feet.

**Activate** 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact) **Requirements** A soul fragment is in the mask; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Talking Corpse|talking corpse]] on the soul fragment, except you communicate telepathically and don't require the fragment's body to speak.
