Aether marbles create violent, lingering eddies of force that extend partially into unseen planes. When the bomb explodes, it deals the listed force damage and force splash damage. Many aether marbles grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
 Surfaces in the splash area are filled with twisting eddies of force, which are difficult terrain for incorporeal creatures but not for corporeal ones. The force eddies in a square disperse after an incorporeal creature enters the square.
