Carved from a hawthorn branch, this wand has a smooth handle, but the shaft remains covered in bark and long thorns. Polished red stones, arranged like a cluster of berries, decorate the pommel.
**Activate** Cast a Spell **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Barkskin|barkskin]] of the indicated level, and the target sprouts long thorns like those of a hawthorn tree. While _barkskin_ lasts, any creature that hits the target with an unarmed Strike or otherwise touches it takes piercing damage from the thorns, with the amount determined by the wand's type. A creature that has [[DATABASE/monsterability/Engulf|engulfed]] or [[DATABASE/monsterability/Swallow Whole|swallowed]] the target takes this damage as well at the start of each of the target's turns.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _barkskin_ of the appropriate level.
