The shaft of this silver bolt is engraved with wiry designs. When a _garrote bolt_ hits a target, it transforms into a silver garrote and wraps around one of the target's appendages, dealing an additional 2d12 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent slashing damage]]. On a critical hit, it wraps around the target's throat, and the target can't breathe until the persistent damage ends.
