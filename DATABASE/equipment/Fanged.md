When etched with this rune, a weapon's hilt or haft becomes engraved with grooves that match the imprints of a wolf's teeth. By putting a _fanged_ weapon in your mouth, you can transform into an animal.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact (magical, polymorph, transmutation) ; **Effect** You transform into a Small or Medium animal that wields the _fanged_ weapon in its jaws; the animal matches the animal you are most closely associated with (a [[Lizardfolk]] would turn into a lizard, a [[Kitsune]] into a fox, a [[Animal Instinct]] [[Barbarian]] into a deer, etc.) or a wolf if no specific animal is applicable. While in this form, you can attack with the _fanged_ weapon even though you don't have any hands. However, you can attack only with the _fanged_ weapon and you don't have hands or the ability to hold items. For effects dependent on how many hands you are using to hold the item, such as the two-hand trait, you are holding the weapon in two hands. You can Dismiss this effect, and it ends automatically if you drop the _fanged_ weapon (whether or not of your own volition).
