This bottle of frozen vapors is captured in the frozen peaks of the crown of the world. After inhaling frost breath, you gain resistance 5 to cold. You can exhale the frost breath as a single action to release a spray of frigid air in a 15- foot cone. Each creature in the area takes 4d6 cold damage with a DC 20 basic Reflex save. For 10 minutes, surfaces in the area are covered in ice, becoming difficult terrain and uneven ground ([[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] DC 20).
