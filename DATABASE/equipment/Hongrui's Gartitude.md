Given as thanks for honoring the memories of three unfortunate travelers who met a tragic end in the Willowshore Hinterlands, this red-hooded cloak is decorated with an image of an elaborately dressed performer whose two companions hold a lantern and umbrella for her.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command, envision, Interact (evocation, light) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** You don't have the umbrella activation of this cloak active; **Effect** With a wave of the cloak to the left, you cause the image of the lantern-holding companion on the cloak to vanish. A floating red lantern appears at your side and follows you at an arm's length while casting bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) like a [[Torch]]. For 1 hour, while the light from this lantern is active, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks. You can Activate the cloak again to dismiss the torch.
