[[DATABASE/deity/Abraxas|Abraxas]] teaches that an eye for an eye is the basis of law. This tattoo of a coiled viper provides a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision ; **Effect** Abraxas transforms the tattoo into a weapon of your vengeance. The _vengeful arm_ crawls into your hand and becomes a [[DATABASE/equipment/Retribution Axe|retribution axe]]. You can use this activation again while holding the axe to revert the vengeful arm to a tattoo. Like other _retribution axes_, you can etch fundamental runes into the _vengeful arm's_ _retribution axe_ to increase its potency or to add [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]].
