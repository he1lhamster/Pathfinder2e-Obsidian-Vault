A vial of this _enigma-sight potion_ seems to contain fragments of kaleidoscopic crystal that reflect mind-bending scenes. However, these “crystals” act like liquid when poured or consumed. Drinking the potion grants you the effects of a [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]] spell, except that you use your Perception modifier and your level for the secret counteract check instead of the normal counteract modifier and spell level. However, if you critically fail the secret counteract check the effect grants, your mind fills in false, nightmarish information. You become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1d4 rounds and [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] as your brain struggles to process what you see.
