Sought after in Cheliax, the cradle minder resembles an [[Imp]]. Despite rumors they were given as part of household pacts with [[Devil]], these creatures were bred from fiendish [[Frog]]. Amphibious, they have leathery wings, frog-like eyes, and a forgiving temperament. They're ideal companions for children, as they tend to bond closely with one person and let out loud croaks when they become aware of danger. They require fiendish earthworms (unique feed) regularly, so ensuring you have a stable food supply is a necessity for ownership.
