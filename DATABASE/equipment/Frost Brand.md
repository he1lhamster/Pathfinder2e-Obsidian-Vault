The blade of this _+2 greater striking [[Frost]] [[Greatsword]]_ appears to be nothing but icy shards. The _frost brand_ automatically extinguishes non-magical fires in a 20-foot emanation. While wielding it, you gain fire resistance 5.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact ; **Effect** You swing the _frost brand_ into the area of an ongoing magical fire, and the blade attempts to counteract the fire with a counteract modifier of +27. If it fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same fire again.
