While they're clasped around your forearms, reassuring focus and devotion flow into you through them. Each time you spend a Focus Point to cast a devotion spell, your divine ally gains a benefit until the start of your next turn, depending on its type.

* **Blade Ally** The bracers hold your weapon in place. You gain a +2 item bonus against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] you of your blade ally.
* **Shield Ally** While raised, the shield grants you resistance 10 to evil damage if you follow the tenets of good, or resistance to good damage if you follow the tenets of evil.
* **Steed Ally** The mount gains a +10-foot status bonus to all its Speeds.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast a champion devotion spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.
