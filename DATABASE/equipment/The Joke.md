_The Joke_ represents solving a problem not with strength, but with cleverness or artifice. As long as you have _The Joke_ invested, you can attempt an appropriate [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] check instead of an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check made to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Force Open]], [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]], [[DATABASE/action/High Jump|High Jump]], [[DATABASE/action/Long Jump|Long Jump]], or [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]]. For example, you could make a Mountain Lore check to climb a cliff in the mountains, or Sailing Lore check to climb the rigging on a ship.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You perform a quick but amusing card trick with _The Joke_ meant to distract others. You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Hideous Laughter|hideous laughter]] on up to 10 creatures in range of the spell. The level of the spell is one-half your level rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is your class DC.
