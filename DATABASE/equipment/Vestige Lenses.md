These simple lenses are alchemically treated to detect the faint smoke trail from a piece of specially formulated sandalwood incense. This incense has an odor undetectable by most people and a long burn time, making it perfect for discreetly tracking individuals. A stick of this incense costs 1 sp and can safely burn for up to 8 hours. While wearing the lenses, you see alchemical fumes in a distinct green tint, granting you a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Track|Track]] a creature marked with the incense and to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] any alchemical vapors. If the smoke is fresh, Tracking via the incense's fumes might use a lower DC than normal for tracking a creature walking on firm surfaces.
