This long, thin _+1 [[Striking]] [[Wounding]] [[Dagger]]_ has a smooth edge on one side and a serrated edge on the other. Its [[Persistent Damage]] comes from slicing away long strips of the target's flesh, and it deals 1d8 persistent bleed damage on a hit instead of 1d6. A creature takes a –2 status penalty to saving throws against diseases for as long as it has persistent bleed damage from this knife.
