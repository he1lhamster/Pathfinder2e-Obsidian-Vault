This polished crystal sphere enhances scrying magic. Any visual information received through a spell with the scrying trait that was cast by the _crystal ball_ appears within the sphere, and any auditory information sounds out from the surface of the sphere. When you cast a [[DATABASE/spell/Scrying|scrying]] spell by any other means while holding the sphere, you can relay any information you receive in the same way, allowing others to see or hear the target.
 The base version of a _crystal ball_ is a sphere of clear quartz, but other versions are made of different stones.
**Activate** 1 minute (command, envision, Interact) **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The _crystal ball_ casts [[DATABASE/spell/Clairvoyance|clairvoyance]] to your specifications.
**Activate** 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact) **Frequency** twice per day; **Effect** The _crystal ball_ casts a DC 33 _scrying_ spell to your specifications.
