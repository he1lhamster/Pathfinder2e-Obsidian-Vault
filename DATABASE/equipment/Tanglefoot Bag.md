A tanglefoot bag is filled with sticky substances. When you hit a creature with a tanglefoot bag, that creature takes a status penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute. Many types of tanglefoot bag also grant an item bonus on attack rolls.
 On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and immobilized for 1 round, and a creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to Fly again for 1 round. Tanglefoot bags are not effective when used on a creature that is in water.
 The target can end any effects by Escaping or spending a total of 3 [[DATABASE/action/Interact|Interact]] actions to carefully remove the sticky substances. These Interact actions don’t have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
