Crafted from heavy steel plating and riveted together with cunning precision, this suit of _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Resilient|resilient]] [[DATABASE/armor/Full Plate|full plate]]_ is specifically designed to protect against sudden explosions. This added layer of security comes at the cost of movement, however.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Trigger** You're affected by an area effect that requires a Reflex save, or you would take splash damage from a scatter weapon; **Effect** The _blast suit_ locks together into a rigid bulwark, protecting you from the blast but preventing you from moving from your position under any circumstances. You become [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]], gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex save against area effects, and gain resistance 5 to all damage you would normally take from area effects and scatter splash damage (this doesn't damage the _blast suit_). These effects persist for as long as the suit remains in the locked position. You can Interact with the suit to unlock it.
