This set of 34 parchment cards usually comes in a velvet bag or simple leather wrap. Each card depicts a different creature, monster, or other being that, when the deck is activated, immediately appears as a believable, life-size illusion. You can look at the card's artwork, but no magical effect takes place until you Activate the deck, shuffling and drawing randomly.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision, Interact ; **Effect** You draw a card, chosen randomly from the remaining cards in the deck, and throw it to the ground to create an illusion of the creature depicted. The image is an [[Illusory Creature]], except it has a range of only 30 feet from where the card was thrown and the illusion lasts until destroyed or until anyone moves or damages the card. The creature takes its actions once on your turn if you're within 60 feet of the card and Sustain the Activation. The illusion ends if you don't Sustain it, or if you activate a new card from the deck.
