Wiry designs mark the silvery coating on a _garrote shot_. When the activated ammunition hits a target, it transforms into a silvery garrote that wraps around one of the target's appendages, dealing 2d12 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent slashing damage]]. On a critical hit, it wraps around the target's throat if it has one, and the target can't breathe until the persistent damage ends. If the persistent damage kills the target, the garrote severs the appendage it's wrapped around.
