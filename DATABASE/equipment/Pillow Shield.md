The shield's blue enameled face is cool to the touch, and displays the moon's current phase at night. When you lay your head on the reverse side of this [[Steel Shield]] (Hardness 6, HP 36, BT 18), it becomes as pliant and supportive as the best pillows. If you complete a period of rest using the _pillow shield_, you can choose to transfer your recovery to the shield. Instead of recovering a number of Hit Points after resting, the shield is restored an equal number of Hit Points instead.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The shield creates an area of vigilance. It casts [[Alarm]] centered on itself; you decide whether it creates a mental alarm or an audible alarm. The alarm goes off at the end of the spell's duration or when triggered as normal, whichever comes first.
