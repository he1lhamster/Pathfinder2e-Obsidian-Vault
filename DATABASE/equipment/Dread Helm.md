The faceplate of a dread helm has a fierce visage that magnifies the effects of fear. Cleverly concealed within is a reservoir that can hold a single [[DATABASE/equipment/Dread Ampoule|dread ampoule]], which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded dread helm can be activated to atomize the dread ampoule, creating a fear-inducing mist that hangs around your face. The mist grants an item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks equal to the dread ampoule's item bonus. The mist also deals mental damage equal to the dread ampoule's splash damage to all creatures within a 5-foot emanation other than you. The effects last for 3 rounds, consuming the dread ampoule, and once the atomization process has begun it can't be deactivated.
