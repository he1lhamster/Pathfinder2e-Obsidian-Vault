Despite the name, a _kaiju fulu_ protects a building against damage of all sorts. When an affixed structure no larger than 100 feet × 100 feet and up to 50 feet tall takes damage, the structure is as hard as [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine|standard-grade adamantine]] against that damage and any damage that occurs within 1 hour thereafter. The fulu then crumbles to dust, and its effects end.
