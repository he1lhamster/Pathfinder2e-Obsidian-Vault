This curved brass horn is a virtuoso instrument with a surprisingly deep tone, etched with images of interlocking lines and swirls. _Sentinel horns_ come in pairs, and each works with only the other of its pair. The listed Price is for a pair of _sentinel horns_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You play a specific tune on the horn. When you do, the other horn also plays the same tune, not matter how far away it is, as long as it is on the same plane.
