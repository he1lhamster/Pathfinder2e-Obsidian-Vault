Woven by fey seamstresses as rewards for servants of nature, countless leaves continually changing colors in autumnal hues comprise autumn's embrace, a suit of _+2 [[Invisibility]] [[Resilient]] [[Leaf Weave]]_. Leaves shed from the armor as they might fall in autumn. When activating the armor's _invisibility_ property rune, you disappear in a swirl of colorful leaves.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision ([[Aura]]) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You call forth a storm of leaves from _autumn's embrace_. These leaves swirl in a 20-foot emanation for 1 minute. Creatures within the area are [[Concealed]], and creatures outside the area are concealed to creatures within the leaves. However, you can see through this concealment. You can Dismiss the activation.
