This cloudy, white liquid helps protect against poisons. When you drink an _antivenom potion_, you can immediately attempt a DC 10 flat check to end any [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent poison damage]] you're taking. In addition, for 1 minute after drinking the potion, you gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking persistent poison damage.
