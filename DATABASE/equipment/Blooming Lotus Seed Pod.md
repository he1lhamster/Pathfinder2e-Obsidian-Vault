The seeds of this lotus seed pod scatter with incredible ease and accuracy, quickly growing into temporary plants.
**Activate****—Floating Pads** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate); **Effect** You scatter the _blooming lotus seed pod's_ seeds across a non-damaging liquid surface within 40 feet of you, where they form into 5 lotus pads that each float in place in a separate square within range for 1 minute. Each lotus pad has a 10- foot radius and can support 1 Large creature, 2 Medium creatures, or 4 Small creatures.
**Activate****—Blooming Flower** 10 minutes (manipulate); **Effect** You plant the _blooming lotus seed pod_ in the ground and a giant lotus flower blooms in that square. Over the next 8 hours, creatures who sleep for at least 6 hours within 30 feet of the lotus flower gain the benefits of long-term rest as though they'd spent an entire day and night resting, and all creatures within the affected area are immune to the effects of the [[DATABASE/spell/Nightmare|nightmare]] spell and other magical effects that affect only sleeping creatures.
