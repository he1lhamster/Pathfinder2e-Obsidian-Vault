This [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Shield|high-grade adamantine]] [[DATABASE/shield/Heavy Rondache|heavy rondache]] (Hardness 17, HP 100, BT 50) bears a _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Shield Boss|shield boss]]_ and has dents that resemble craters on its surface. While wielding the shield, you have fire resistance 15.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You Stride up to three times. This movement doesn't trigger reactions and ignores difficult terrain. At the end of your movement, you deal 6d10 bludgeoning damage in a 10-foot emanation and 14d6 fire damage in a 40-foot emanation (DC 40 basic Reflex save, with the results applying to both the bludgeoning and fire damage). The space where you end your movement and all adjacent spaces become difficult terrain for 1 minute, and the shield glows red-hot for 10 minutes, during which it gains the effect of the [[DATABASE/equipment/Flaming|greater flaming]] property rune.
