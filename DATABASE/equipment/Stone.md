Stone was one of the earliest materials used to create tools, and crafters can still fashion it into a variety of implements, weapons, and even armor. Simple stone objects are made from common materials such as flint or basalt, while exquisite stone objects might be made from crystal, obsidian, or semi-precious gems. Particularly notable stone armors or weapons might even be crafted entirely from a giant emerald, ruby, or sapphire, though they can still use the base statistics presented below. Stone can replace the striking surface of any melee weapon as long as it has no complex moving parts, and ammunition can be crafted with it. Stone can replace metal components in [[Chain]] and [[Composite]] armor; only [[Cloth]] armor that specifically describes itself as being made from stone can be crafted from this material
