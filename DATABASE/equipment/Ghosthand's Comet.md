The barrel of this long rifle is translucent in places, forming a swirled pattern along the metal, and its stock is formed of crimson wood. _Ghosthand's Comet_ is a _+4 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|major striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Bane|beast-bane]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Impactful|greater impactful]] advanced firearm_ with a range increment of 300 feet. It deals 5d8 force damage and has the backstabber, concussive, kickback, and fatal d12 traits. As a star gun, _Ghosthand's Comet_ runs on magic and doesn't use ammunition or black powder. The weapon is silent when fired.
