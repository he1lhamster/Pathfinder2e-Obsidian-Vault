This lush velvet capelet is embroidered with images of musicians playing a wide variety of instruments. The images animate when you make art, remaining embroidered, but smoothly unknitting and reknitting in time with your performance. The figures play music that perfectly accompanies your instrument, voice, or movements, granting you a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast a bard composition spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You peel the musicians from the garment and fling them around you. The cloak casts a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Phantom Crowd|phantom crowd]] spell (DC 28); each of the 10-foot squares must be adjacent to you. The crowd looks like the musicians on the garment and continues to accompany your Performance checks. You can Sustain this effect as described in the spell.
**Craft Requirements** You are a [[DATABASE/class_/Bard|bard]].
