A creature wearing _olfactory stimulators_ gains a sense of smell, which is as precise as an average member of its species, as well as the scent special ability if members of its species typically have that ability. _Olfactory stimulators_ can be fitted to animal companions as well as sapient creatures; stimulators produced for companion use have the companion trait.
