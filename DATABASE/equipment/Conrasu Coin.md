These wooden discs sometimes form spontaneously at the Wood Pile, a secret [[Conrasu]] location suffused with extraplanar energy. A conrasu coin can be activated to call upon the power of a specific type of [[Aeon]].

## Conrasu Coin (Arbiter)<span class="item-type">Item 3</span>

**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
**Price** 7 gp
**Trigger** You attempt a [[Diplomacy]] check to [[Make an Impression]].
 This coin has small wings like an [[Arbiter]], the messenger and diplomat aeon. When you activate the coin, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the Diplomacy check, which increases to a +3 circumstance bonus to Make an Impression on a lawful creature.

## Conrasu Coin (Bythos)<span class="item-type">Item 10</span>

**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
**Price** 200 gp
**Trigger** You're targeted with an attack but the opponent hasn't rolled yet.
 This cog-like coin bears an hourglass on one side and the four-armed silhouette of a [[Bythos]]—aeons that steward over time—on the other. When activated, you catch a glimpse of your body moving on one of its potential timelines in response to danger and you follow those movements to dodge. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the attack, and after resolving the attack, you can Stride up to 10 feet without triggering reactions. If you have the [[Nimble Roll]] feat and the attack misses, you can Stride up to 20 feet instead.
