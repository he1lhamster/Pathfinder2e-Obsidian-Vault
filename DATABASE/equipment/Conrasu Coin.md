These wooden discs sometimes form spontaneously at the Wood Pile, a secret [[DATABASE/ancestry/Conrasu|conrasu]] location suffused with extraplanar energy. A conrasu coin can be activated to call upon the power of a specific type of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Aeon|aeon]].

## Conrasu Coin (Arbiter)<span class="item-type">Item 3</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Price** 7 gp
**Trigger** You attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]].
 This coin has small wings like an [[DATABASE/monster/Arbiter|arbiter]], the messenger and diplomat aeon. When you activate the coin, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the Diplomacy check, which increases to a +3 circumstance bonus to Make an Impression on a lawful creature.

## Conrasu Coin (Bythos)<span class="item-type">Item 10</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Price** 200 gp
**Trigger** You're targeted with an attack but the opponent hasn't rolled yet.
 This cog-like coin bears an hourglass on one side and the four-armed silhouette of a [[DATABASE/monster/Bythos|bythos]]—aeons that steward over time—on the other. When activated, you catch a glimpse of your body moving on one of its potential timelines in response to danger and you follow those movements to dodge. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the attack, and after resolving the attack, you can Stride up to 10 feet without triggering reactions. If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Nimble Roll|Nimble Roll]] feat and the attack misses, you can Stride up to 20 feet instead.
