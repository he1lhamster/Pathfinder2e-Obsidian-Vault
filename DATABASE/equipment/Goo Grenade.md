A goo grenade is a flask filled with a fast-growing, short-lived alchemical ooze. When you hit a creature with a goo grenade, that creature takes [[Persistent Damage]] and a circumstance penalty to its Speeds from the clinging goo.
 The target can end any penalties, conditions, and persistent damage caused by the bomb by [[Escape]] or spending a total of 3 Interact actions to pry themselves free of the ooze. These Interact actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
