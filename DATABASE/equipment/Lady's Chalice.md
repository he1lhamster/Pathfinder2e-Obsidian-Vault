This silver chalice bears the symbol of [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]], a swirling cloud that transforms into a flight of whippoorwills that encircle the top. The chalice can be activated in one of two ways, though only once per day total.

The chalice fills with a single vial's worth of [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy Water|holy water]]. The water loses its potency after 1 day if poured into any container other than a font specifically sanctified by a cleric of Pharasma. It similarly loses its potency 1 day after being removed from such a font.

The chalice splashes a spiral of _holy water_ into an adjacent space. This is a simple thrown weapon with a range of 5 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. If it hits, it deals 2d6 good damage and 2 good splash damage (including to you, if you're evil).
