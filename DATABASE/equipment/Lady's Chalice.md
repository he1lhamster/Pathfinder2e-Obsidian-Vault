This silver chalice bears the symbol of [[Pharasma]], a swirling cloud that transforms into a flight of whippoorwills that encircle the top. The chalice can be activated in one of two ways, though only once per day total.

**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Frequency** once per day

---
The chalice fills with a single vial's worth of [[Holy Water]]. The water loses its potency after 1 day if poured into any container other than a font specifically sanctified by a cleric of Pharasma. It similarly loses its potency 1 day after being removed from such a font.

### [[Strike]] <span class="action-icon">1</span>

**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Frequency** once per day
**Requirements** The _Lady's chalice_ is full of a vial's worth of _holy water_

---
The chalice splashes a spiral of _holy water_ into an adjacent space. This is a simple thrown weapon with a range of 5 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. If it hits, it deals 2d6 good damage and 2 good splash damage (including to you, if you're evil).
