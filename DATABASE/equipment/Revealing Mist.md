Kept in an airtight spray bottle, revealing mist is an alchemical concoction that creates a sticky and clinging mist of chemicals in a 15-foot cone when sprayed. It doesn't affect visibility but causes [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] creatures in the area to be [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] rather than [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]]. Revealing mist is ineffective in water or in areas with other factors affecting the spread of the mist, as determined by the GM. It remains in the area for 1 minute or until any significant wind disperses it, whichever comes first.

The mist spreads in a 30-foot cone instead of a 15-foot cone.
