Translucent and nearly weightless, this opalescent paint seems to resolve into occult symbols if stared at too long. When used to cover a 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall section of a wall, the paint turns that section of wall ghostly and incorporeal to a depth of 10 feet, allowing corporeal creatures and objects to pass through it. The portal persists for 10 minutes. When this effect wears off, anything remaining within the portal is shunted to the nearest exit.
 Force effects, other incorporeal objects and creatures, and [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] weapons can't cross through the wall, as is normal for incorporeality. An incorporeal creature that's inside the wall when the paint is used is shunted to the nearest exit.
