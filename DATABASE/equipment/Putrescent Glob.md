This repulsive, hairy glob dangles from the end of your weapon. When you activate the _putrescent glob_, the creature you damaged must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or its [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] condition increases to sickened 2, and it can't reduce its sickened condition until the end of its next turn. On a critical failure, it's also [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] until the end of its next turn.
