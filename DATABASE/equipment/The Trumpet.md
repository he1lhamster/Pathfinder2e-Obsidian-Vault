_The Trumpet_ represents timely warning. As long as you have _The Trumpet_ invested, you (and only you) hear the sound of trumpets when you're about to be attacked. This grants you a +2 item bonus to initiative checks made with hearing-based Perception checks. This bonus increases to +3 if you're at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** A blast of inspiring noise erupts from the card in a 60-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 14d6 sonic damage (with a basic Fortitude save equal to your class DC). Creatures that fail the save are [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] for 1 round (1 minute on a critical failure). The damage increases to 16d6 if you're at least 13th level, to 18d6 if you're at least 15th level, to 20d6 if you're at least 17th level, and to 22d6 if you're at least 19th level.
