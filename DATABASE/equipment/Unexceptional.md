Merchants traveling into Stonebreach sometimes apply this accessory rune to specific wares to avoid the notice of thieves. Conversely, many thieves in Highhelm apply these runes to stolen goods to help them smuggle items out of the city. The item gains the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Aura|magic aura]] to appear as non-magical. The rune's effects also cause anyone who closely observes or holds the item to believe it is a mundane version of that type of item, such as believing a magical [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]] to be an ordinary dagger, unless the creature succeeds at a DC 18 Will save. Creatures that succeed their save see that there is more to the item than meets the eye, but aren't immediately aware of the _magic aura_ effect.
