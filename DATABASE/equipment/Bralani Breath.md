_Bralani breath_ is a species of mint with small, green flowers, said to grow on battlefields where the opposing sides were equally matched. Sprigs of the flowers blow gently in a breeze of their own creation. If you cast [[DATABASE/spell/Mage Armor|mage armor]] using _bralani breath_, you release a small blast of concussive air in an emanation of a size that depends on the catalyst's type. Some unattended objects are pushed away from you. Large or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save equal to your spell save DC or be pushed the same distance away from you.
