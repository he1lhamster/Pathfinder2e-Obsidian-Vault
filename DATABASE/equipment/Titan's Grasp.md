These bronze gauntlets each have a small red gem embedded in the wrist. You gain a +3 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]]. If you successfully Grapple an enemy that's at least one size category larger than you, the gauntlets dig into it, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier, plus an additional 2d6 on a critical success.
 When you invest the gloves, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact (sonic) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** You have two hands free; **Effect** You clap the gauntlets together with a thunderous crack that deals 6d10 sonic damage in a 30-foot emanation. Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 35 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is deafened for 1 minute, and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
