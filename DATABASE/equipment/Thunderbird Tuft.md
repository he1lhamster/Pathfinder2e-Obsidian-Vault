This carved chunk of amber contains a single tuft of gray feathers, which spark with electricity to create an odd jittery sensation in anyone holding the amber for long. When used as part of a [[DATABASE/spell/Shocking Grasp|shocking grasp]] spell, _thunderbird tuft_ funnels electricity back into the spellcaster in a defensive nimbus. For 1 minute, any creature that touches you or that hits you with a melee unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon attack takes the listed electricity damage.
