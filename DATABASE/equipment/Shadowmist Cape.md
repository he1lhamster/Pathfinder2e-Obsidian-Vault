This black cape flows more like a vaporous liquid than fabric. The cape grants you a +3 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks. When you invest the cape, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** A creature misses you with an attack; **Effect** Attempt a Stealth check against the triggering creature's Perception DC. If you roll a success, you're [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from that creature until the end of your next turn or until right after you use a hostile action against that creature. If you roll a critical success, you're hidden from that creature until the end of your next turn, even if you use hostile actions against that creature.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** With a twirl of the cape, you transform yourself into a puff of gray smoke. You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]] on yourself.
