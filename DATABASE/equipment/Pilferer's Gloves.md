Made of soft and subtle black leather, these gloves fit tightly but aren't uncomfortable and don't impede your sense of touch. As long as you're trained in [[Thievery]] while wearing these gloves, you're always considered one skill rank higher than your actual rank. If you possess a Legendary skill rank in Thievery, you gain a +2 item bonus to Thievery checks instead. When you invest the gloves, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You fail or critically fail a Thievery skill check; **Effect** If you failed the Thievery skill check, you succeed at that check instead. If you critically failed, you fail instead.
