A spirited debate persists among scholars on whether the eponymous tyrant of this grimoire actually refers to Tar-Baphon, the necromancer Geb, or even the goddess [[DATABASE/deity/Urgathoa|Urgathoa]] herself. This grimoire appears at first to be a series of writs that makes arrogant demands of the reader, those around them, and the universe. Anyone who gives these writings more than a cursory look realizes the writs hold spells much like any other grimoire, with the [[DATABASE/spell/Animate Dead|animate dead]] spell being particularly prominent. _Tyrant's writs_ grants you the ability to demand more from the undead you animate.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision (metamagic) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** If your next action is to Cast a Spell to cast an _animate dead_ spell prepared with _tyrant's writs_, you can choose one of the following additional benefits to grant the summoned undead.

* **Bloody** The undead gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing]] equal to its level.
* **Explosive** When it reaches 0 Hit Points, the undead explodes, dealing 4d6 fire damage to adjacent creatures, with a basic Reflex save using the _animate dead_ spell's DC. As normal, since the [[DATABASE/spell/Final Sacrifice|final sacrifice]] spell doesn't reduce the target to 0 Hit Points, it doesn't cause this explosion.
* **Necrotic Speed** The undead gains a +10-foot status bonus to all its Speeds.
* **Rotten** Any living creature who starts its turn adjacent to the undead who isn't at full Hit Points takes 1d6 poison damage.
