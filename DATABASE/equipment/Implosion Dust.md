Sealed in a packet so it can be released in a pressurized puff, implosion dust causes amorphous creatures to compress and shrink by hardening and even evaporating the liquid components of their physical forms. It's effective at weakening [[Elemental, Water]], [[Elemental, Air]], ooze, and other creatures the GM determines are similarly amorphous, which can even include particularly gelatinous aberrations. You release the dust toward one creature within 5 feet of you, which must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Implosion dust functions for up to 6 rounds. It then becomes inert, and the creature returns to its normal size.
**Critical Success** The dust becomes inert, and the creature returns to its normal size.
**Success** The target increases in size one step, up to its normal size. If it's at its normal size after the increase, the effect ends.
**Failure** The target decreases in size one step, to a minimum of Tiny. The reach of each of its Strikes decreases by 5 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet if the creature is Small or larger, or a minimum of 0 feet if the creature is Tiny. Shrinking also imposes a status penalty to the creature's physical melee damage. This penalty is –2 for every step lower than its normal size the creature is.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target decreases in size by two steps.
