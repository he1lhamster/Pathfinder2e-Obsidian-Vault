A dose of this slightly fizzy, pale-pink tonic vitalizes the body and bolsters the spirit, bringing those suffering from aches and pains brought on by illness some temporary respite. For 8 hours after drinking this elixir, reduce the value of one of the following conditions you're suffering by 1: [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy]], [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]]. A condition whose value is reduced to 0 is not removed; after 8 hours, the condition returns to its original value, unless its duration expired or it was removed by another means.
