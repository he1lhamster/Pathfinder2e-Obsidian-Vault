The religious symbol of [[DATABASE/deity/Torag|Torag]], the forge god—an ornate hammer of dwarven construction—adorns the face of this reinforced [[DATABASE/shield/Steel Shield|steel shield]] (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20). The shield is a [[DATABASE/equipment/Religious Symbol|religious symbol]] of Torag.
 You and any adjacent allies have fire resistance 5 while you have the shield raised. When used for a [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]], the _forge warden_ rings out like the hammer strike of a blacksmith, and the symbol glows as if lit by the fires of a furnace.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command (fire) **Trigger** You use the forge warden to Shield Block an adjacent creature’s attack and the shield takes damage; **Effect** The attacking creature takes 2d6 fire damage.
