Stasian actuators help the limbs of this [[DATABASE/armor/Full Plate|full plate]] move of their own accord, as long as they're supplied with power. A chamber in the chest plate can hold a single [[DATABASE/equipment/Bottled Lightning|bottled lightning]], which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded suit of powered full plate can be activated to lower the armor's Strength requirement by 1 plus the item bonus of the loaded bomb. The armor's normal penalties still apply, based on this altered Strength. However, add the bottled lightning's item bonus to your [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Force Open]], [[DATABASE/action/High Jump|High Jump]], [[DATABASE/action/Long Jump|Long Jump]], and [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]]. These effects last for 10 minutes. The armor uses up the bottled lightning during the duration and can't be activated again until a new one is installed.
