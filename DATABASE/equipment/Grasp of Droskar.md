This _+1 [[Striking]] [[Gauntlet]]_ appears little more than a dull, soot-stained, metal-plated glove at first glance, but in truth it is an invasive boon granted by [[Droskar]] to his most faithful subjects. Placing the glove on your hand causes excruciating pain as your appendage curls into a tight fist and then slowly transforms to a supernaturally hard ball of black stone, fusing to you and preventing you from using this hand for anything other than gauntlet Strikes or the _grasp of Droskar's_ activated abilities (a _grasp of Droskar_ does not have the free-hand weapon trait). The gauntlet can't be removed without a successful casting of [[Remove Curse]] or a similar spell. The gauntlet reverts to normal (and can be removed with ease) if the curse is removed, the hand is removed from the body, or the wearer dies.
