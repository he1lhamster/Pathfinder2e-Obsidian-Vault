The _black king_ is a _+2 [[Striking]] [[Ashen]] [[Blunderbuss]]_. While the dark metal frame is still pleasant to look at, this design prioritizes destructive power over aesthetic appeal. This specialized blunderbuss has a [[Cat]] radius of 20 feet instead of 10, and all splash damage it deals is negative damage instead of physical. Due to the risk of collateral damage, this weapon is typically only used by the especially foolhardy or reckless.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You unleash a blast of draining flame, dealing 5d6 fire damage and 5d6 negative damage to all creatures in a 60 foot cone (DC 34 basic Reflex save). Creatures who fail their saving throw are knocked back 5 feet. Creatures who critically fail are knocked back 10 feet and fall [[Prone]].
