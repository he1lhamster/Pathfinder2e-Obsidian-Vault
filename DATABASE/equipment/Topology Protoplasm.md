This slimy gel wriggles to the touch, as if covered by a multitude of imperceptible cilia. If applied to a creature or object no larger than 7 feet in any dimension, the protoplasm shifts it into an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ooze|ooze]]-like state for 1 minute, allowing the subject to squash and stretch harmlessly. In this state, a creature that attempts a check to [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeeze]] uses the outcome one degree of success better than it rolls and can move its full Speed while Squeezing, and an object can fit through a space 2 feet across. One vial can cover a creature or object of up to Large size, but as each vial is made from a specific ooze, multiple vials can't be combined together to cover a larger object, as the two gels simply negate each other.
