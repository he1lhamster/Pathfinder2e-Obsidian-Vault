The _scarlet queen_ is a _+2 [[Striking]] [[Flaming]] [[Hammer Gun]]_. Due to the awkward and complex nature of combination weapons, it's by far the least popular of Ornmarr's designs, but those who have mastered it consider it his finest creation to date. The glistening red steel always feels warm to the touch and sheds dim light in a 15-foot radius. Any non-magical object of light Bulk destroyed by the _scarlet queen_ is reduced completely to ash.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** The _scarlet queen_ is in its firearm form; **Effect** You fire a blast of magically disruptive energy at an unattended magical object. You cast 5th-level [[Dispel Magic]] with a counteract bonus of +21 against the object.
