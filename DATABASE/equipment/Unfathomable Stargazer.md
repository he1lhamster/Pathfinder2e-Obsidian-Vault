An _unfathomable stargazer_ is a handheld brass telescope etched with constellations, the patterns of which form bizarre, shifting runes. You can observe the night sky with an _unfathomable stargazer_, however, the constellations you glimpse through the telescope distort with expanding and contracting fields of darkness among them. You use [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] instead of Perception or [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Astronomy Lore]] when observing the skies with this item, and gain a +2 item bonus on all checks to do so. Once you use it, it fuses to you, and you must succeed at a DC 35 Will save to use another device to observe the stars, including your naked eyes. The telescope imposes a –4 circumstance penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]] or navigate. If you critically fail this Survival check, you're subjected to [[DATABASE/spell/Warp Mind|warp mind]] (DC 34) as you glimpse something horrifying and alien amid the darkness.
