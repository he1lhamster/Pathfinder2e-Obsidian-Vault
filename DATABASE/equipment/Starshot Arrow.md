The metal of these arrows is said to have come from a star that ventured too close to Golarion and was shot down by a moonlit archer. When you activate and shoot a _starshot arrow_, you take no range penalties against any target that you can personally detect. There must be a line of effect between you and the target.

## Starshot Arrow (Lesser)<span class="item-type">Item 7</span>

**Price** 55 gp
The target must be within the maximum range of your weapon.

## Starshot Arrow (Greater)<span class="item-type">Item 14</span>

**Price** 800 gp
You can fire at any creature you can detect, regardless of range. The arrow travels instantly, hitting your target as soon as you fire the arrow. This is a teleportation effect.
