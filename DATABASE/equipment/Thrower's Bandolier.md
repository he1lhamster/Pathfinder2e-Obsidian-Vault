This bandolier is covered in straps and pouches capable of holding up to 2 Bulk of one-handed thrown weapons. A _thrower's bandolier_ has a [[DATABASE/equipment/Weapon Potency|+1 weapon potency]] rune etched into it, and it can be etched with runes as though it were a one-handed thrown weapon. When you invest the _thrower's bandolier_, you can attune it to all the weapons sheathed in it (this ends any previous attunements made with the bandolier). Whenever you draw a weapon from the bandolier, the bandolier's runes are replicated onto that weapon. Any runes already on the weapon are suppressed, and any runes previously replicated to a different weapon in this way are removed, returning it to normal.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact ; **Effect** All weapons attuned to the bandolier, not including any weapons you're currently wielding, return to the bandolier.
