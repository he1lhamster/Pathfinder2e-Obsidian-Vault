This enchanted lasso is a [[DATABASE/equipment/Net|net]] that can be used to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] creatures up to 30 feet away, requires a DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Force Open]], and has an [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC of 18. It's permanently attached to a 30-foot rope.
 While using the _lawbringer's lasso_ to Grapple, you receive a +1 item bonus to Grapple checks against creatures with the chaotic trait. If you roll a critical failure on your attempt to Grapple a chaotic creature with the _lawbringer's lasso_, you get a failure instead.
