This enchanted lasso is a [[Net]] that can be used to [[Grapple]] creatures up to 30 feet away, requires a DC 18 [[Athletics]] check to [[Force Open]], and has an [[Escape]] DC of 18. It's permanently attached to a 30-foot rope.
 While using the _lawbringer's lasso_ to Grapple, you receive a +1 item bonus to Grapple checks against creatures with the chaotic trait. If you roll a critical failure on your attempt to Grapple a chaotic creature with the _lawbringer's lasso_, you get a failure instead.
