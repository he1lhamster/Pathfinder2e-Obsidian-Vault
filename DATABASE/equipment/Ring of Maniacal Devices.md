This ring seems like simple tarnished brass, but it enhances your curiosity about traps and devices of all kinds. You can use an Interact action to pull a set of [[DATABASE/equipment/Thieves' Tools|thieves’ tools]] from the ring. These tools appear in your hand and fold back into the ring if they would leave your possession. They grant you a +2 item bonus to Thievery checks to Disable a Device and to Pick a Lock, and the ring’s insights grant you the same bonus to Crafting checks to Craft and Repair snares and traps.
**Activate** 10 minutes (Interact) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You create a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Glyph of Warding|glyph of warding]] containing [[DATABASE/spell/Fireball|fireball]]. You can have only one _glyph of warding_ from a _ring of maniacal devices_ active at a time, even if you have multiple rings, and the spell ends if you lose your investiture in the ring.
