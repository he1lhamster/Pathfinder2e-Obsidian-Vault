This wand is composed of ash that has been compressed, shaped, and sealed with a clear lacquer. When you trace the wand's tip along a solid surface, it leaves a black trail of charcoal. Writing with the wand in this way never damages or wears the wand down.
**Activate** Cast a Spell **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge; **Effect** You cast _disintegrate_. If the spell reduces a living creature to fine powder, you animate that creature's ashes into a [[DATABASE/monster/Sulfur Zombie|sulfur zombie]] with the same general appearance as the disintegrated creature. You control this sulfur zombie, which gains the minion and summoned traits. You can issue a verbal command to the sulfur zombie as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. The sulfur zombie crumbles into inanimate ash when reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _disintegrate_.
