A _Lesser Cube of Nex_ acts as a _[[Cube of Force]]_, but the effect lasts until you press the sixth face to Dismiss it, and the activation can be used once per hour. You must first Dismiss any previous activation before you use it again. Additionally, each _Lesser Cube of Nex_ is attuned to a single school of magic. Within 5 feet of the _Lesser Cube_, all magic from that school is suppressed or impossible to cast, with the effects of a 10th-level [[Antimagic Field]] spell. While there are eight _Lesser Cubes of Nex_, each of the artifacts is unique, as there's only one _Lesser Cube of Nex_ for each school of magic.
