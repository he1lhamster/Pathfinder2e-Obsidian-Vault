This _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Composite Shortbow|composite shortbow]]_ is made from wood, horn, and sinew. Once wielded by Ninshaburian heretics, it's carried in a leather case etched with images of Namzaruum in combat with [[DATABASE/monster/Somnalu|Somnalu]]. On a successful Strike, it deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You make a ranged Strike. On a hit, a vortex of air trails the arrow as it travels. When the arrow strikes its target, the vortex expands to a 30-foot radius from its point of impact. The arrow deals an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage against its target. For the next 3 minutes, any physical ranged attacks that would strike a target within the vortex deal an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage. The vortex is difficult terrain, and creatures attempting to fly through the vortex using a move action must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save, losing its move action on a failed save. Any gases within the vortex are cleared by the winds.
