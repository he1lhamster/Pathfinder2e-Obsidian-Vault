Composing a _stage fright missive_ usually involves creating a scathing review, insulting letter, or embarrassing image that ridicules the recipient. The activating creature must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be overcome with embarrassment for 1 hour, taking a –1 status penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]], [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]], and [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks. During this time, if the creature attempts to speak or perform in front of an audience, they become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. When they recover from this sickened condition, the missive's effects end. You choose when composing the missive whether it remains as a non-magical document or burns to ash after imparting its magic.
