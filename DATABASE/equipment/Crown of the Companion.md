Stories tell of a king who once loved his subjects so much he was willing to give his own life energy for them, using an object like the _crown of the companion_. Whether true or not, this majestic wooden crown bears elaborate carvings depicting that tale with images of a regal figure giving increasingly of themself to a throng of needy subjects. While wearing this crown, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You bow to an ally within 30 feet, creating a magical bond between the two of you as if you cast [[Shield Other]] targeting the ally. The link remains even if you move more than 30 feet away from them. At the end of the spell's duration, your ally recovers 4d8 Hit Points and you recover half of what they recover.
