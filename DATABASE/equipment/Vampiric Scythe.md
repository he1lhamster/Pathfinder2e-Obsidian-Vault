The blade of this _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Wounding|wounding]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Scythe|scythe]]_ is sharp enough to produce a whistling sound when swung through the air. The shaft is made of ebony wood with a sickly shine to it, much like the shine of infected wounds and contaminated water.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Trigger** An enemy critically succeeds at an attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] you; **Effect** As the scythe leaves your hand, it drinks the triggering creature's blood. The creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]] (drained 3 on a critical failure). If the triggering creature becomes drained, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to the triggering creature's level. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You critically succeed at a Strike against a living opponent; **Effect** The scythe drains life essence from your opponent into you. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half the slashing damage the scythe dealt to the foe. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
