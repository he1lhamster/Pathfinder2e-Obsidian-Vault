This toxin erratically stimulates the limbs, forcing unexpected shifts in momentum. The result resembles a gangly, lurching dance. At the start of each turn, the victim takes one or more Steps in a random direction if able. This movement is forced and doesn't count against the victim's actions for the round. 
**Saving Throw** DC 30 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 4d6 poison damage and 1 Step of forced movement (1 round); **Stage 2** 6d6 poison damage, [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]], and 1 Step of forced movement (1 round); **Stage 3** 8d6 poison damage, clumsy 2, 2 Steps of forced movement (1 round)
