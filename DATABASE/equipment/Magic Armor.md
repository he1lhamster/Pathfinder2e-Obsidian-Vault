A suit of magic armor is simply a suit of armor or explorer’s clothing etched with fundamental runes. An armor potency rune increases the armor’s item bonus to AC, and a resilient rune adds an item bonus to saving throws.
 The Prices here are for all types of armor. You don’t need to adjust the Price from leather armor to full plate or the like. These armors are made of standard materials, not precious materials such as mithral.
