This gritty salve can be applied to the skin of a creature to form a thin layer of smooth stone on its body for 20 minutes. During this time, it gains resistance 3 to piercing and slashing damage. Further, the creature gains a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] a statue or creature made of stone for 8 hours, or until its body is fully submersed in water.
