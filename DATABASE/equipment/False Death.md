Typically used to fake one’s death, this poison swiftly causes the imbiber to lose consciousness and suppresses vital signs. A creature examining the unconscious target must succeed at a [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check against the imbiber’s [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] DC + 4 to determine that the target is alive, and a critical success allows the examiner to determine that a toxin is causing the effect. The false death toxin has an extremely bitter taste (Perception DC 10 to detect), making it difficult to trick a creature into consuming the poison against its wishes. 
**Saving Throw** DC 18 Fortitude; **Onset** 10 minutes; **Maximum Duration** 5 days; **Stage 1** [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 2]] (1 round); **Stage 2** [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] (1 hour); **Stage 3** unconscious (1 day)
