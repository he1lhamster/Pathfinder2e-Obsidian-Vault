This oil contains magnetically charged iron filings repelled into opposite ends of the vial. For 1 minute after you apply this oil to armor, any creature that hits you with a melee Strike must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save with the following effects.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is pushed up to 10 feet away from you (the GM determines the direction).
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is also knocked prone.
