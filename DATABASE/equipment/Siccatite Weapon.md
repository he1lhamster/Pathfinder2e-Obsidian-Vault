Crafting weapons from siccatite is often enough to drive smiths to despair, as the extreme temperature of the metal can cause it to shatter while being worked. Siccatite weapons have substantial grip wrappings to protect their wielders from the metal's extreme temperatures. They're constantly surrounded by a heat haze or a halo of rime, depending on the siccatite's type. Siccatite weapons automatically gain either a [[Flaming]] or [[Frost]] property rune, for hot and cold siccatite respectively, even if they aren't otherwise enchanted; this rune can't be removed, and it deals 1d8 damage instead of 1d6 damage. This uses one of the weapon's property rune slots as normal. High-grade siccatite gains a _greater flaming_ (hot siccatite) or _greater frost_ (cold siccatite) property instead.
