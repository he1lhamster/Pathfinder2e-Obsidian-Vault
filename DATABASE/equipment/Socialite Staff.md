A _socialite staff_ is designed as an ornate cane, its metal body glimmering with jewels and gold inlays. A sculpture carved from obsidian tops the head of the staff, its design depending on its wielder's taste. Common choices include birds, flowers, or family crests. While wielding a _socialite staff_, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on members of high society. 
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
