Devised to bypass detection, a dose of taster's folly consists of two compounds that aren't mixed but placed in the contents of one meal. Each compound is harmless on its own. The DC to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about this poison from one of its components is 23 and attempts to use magic to detect the unmixed components require a successful DC 23 counteract check. The onset period begins only if a victim consumes both compounds during the same hour. If the two compounds mix prior to consumption, they become toxic and are detectable as such. The [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] condition can't be ended until the poison's effects end.
 **Saving Throw** DC 21 Fortitude; **Onset** 10 minutes; **Maximum Duration** 6 minutes; **Stage 1** 2d4 poison damage (1 minute); **Stage 2** 3d4 poison damage and sickened 1 (1 minute); **Stage 3** 4d4 poison damage and sickened 1 (1 minute)
