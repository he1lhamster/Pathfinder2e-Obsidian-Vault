This large jug always seems to contain just enough of the holder's favorite alcohol to share with a friend. As long as you're holding the jug, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks. If you share a sip of the liquor from the jug with a creature, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next Diplomacy check to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] or [[DATABASE/action/Request|Request]] something from that creature any time within the next month.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You take a long swig on the jug and then [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about a creature you can see, with a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. If you fail but don't critically fail this check, you get a success instead. You're then [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 3 rounds.
