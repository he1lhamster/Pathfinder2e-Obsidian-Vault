Rusting ammunition is made using a [[DATABASE/monster/Rust Monster|rust monster's]] saliva and, when activated, deals damage to objects or creatures primarily made of metal. The target takes [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]] for a duration determined by the type of ammunition used. A creature that drops to 0 Hit Points while taking this persistent damage crumbles into fine powder; its gear remains. The ammunition's type determines the maximum amount of an object that's destroyed.
**Craft Requirements** Supply the saliva of a rust monster.
