Prized by naari geniekin who prefer to fight with their fists, _scalding gauntlets_ are a pair of _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Spiked Gauntlet|spiked gauntlets]]_. The intricate golden gauntlets are engraved with [[DATABASE/language/Pyric|Pyric]] writing praising the glories of the Dominion of Flame and embellished with shimmering black and red gemstones. A creature you [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grab]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrain]] while wearing the gauntlets must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]] and be [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] from the pain; it's temporarily immune to being sickened by _scalding gauntlets_ for 1 hour.
