Prized by naari geniekin who prefer to fight with their fists, _scalding gauntlets_ are a pair of _+2 [[Striking]] [[Spiked Gauntlet]]_. The intricate golden gauntlets are engraved with [[Pyric]] writing praising the glories of the Dominion of Flame and embellished with shimmering black and red gemstones. A creature you [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] while wearing the gauntlets must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 2d6 [[Persistent Damage]] and be [[Sickened]] from the pain; it's temporarily immune to being sickened by _scalding gauntlets_ for 1 hour.
