This _+1 [[Striking]] [[Tekko-kagi]]_ resembles a clawed skeletal hand that fits over your own. Embedded in the back of the bony hand is an onyx gemstone held in place by fine silver chains. When the claws tear into a living creature, the gem pulses with negative energy. The _skeletal claw_ deals an additional 1d4 [[Persistent Damage]] to living creatures (1d10 persistent negative damage on a critical hit).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You cast a spell to summon an undead creature that has a skeletal structure, such as with [[Animate Dead]]; **Effect** The triggering undead creature has 10 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute. As long as any of these temporary Hit Points remain, the _skeletal claw_ doesn't deal additional negative damage.
