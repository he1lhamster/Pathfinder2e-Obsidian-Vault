Siccatite shields radiate extreme temperatures that protect them from energy damage. A protective coating on the wielder's side of the shield protects them from siccatite's radiant heat or cold but makes the shields bulkier than average. Standard-grade siccatite shields have resistance 10 to the corresponding energy type: fire damage for a hot siccatite shield or cold damage for a cold siccatite shield, as it takes even more extreme temperatures to affect them. They also provide some resistance to opposing temperatures because of their own extreme temperature, which extends to you when you [[Raise a Shield]]. The shield has resistance 5 to the opposing damage type (cold damage for a hot siccatite shield or fire damage for a cold siccatite shield), and while you have a siccatite shield Raised, you gain that resistance to the opposing damage type as well. For a high-grade siccatite shield, the resistances increase from 10 to 20 for damage of the corresponding type, and from 5 to 10 for damage of the opposing type.
