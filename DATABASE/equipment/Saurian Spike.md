This jagged, bony growth narrows to a sharp, pointed tip. Deep groves from some former battle scar its surface. The bearer of a _saurian spike_ often feels a sudden surge in power and confidence.

* **Armor** You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet.
* **Weapon** (auditory, emotion, fear, visual) When you cast a polymorph spell by activating the spike, your battle form is exceptionally fearsome. Each enemy in a 30-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 27 Will saving throw or become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]] (frightened 2 on a critical failure).
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Gouging Claw|gouging claw]].
