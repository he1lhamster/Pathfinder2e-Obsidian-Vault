You want revenge badly enough that you tattoo your nemesis's name in a place you can easily see to remember your vow to settle the score. Anyone who sees the tattoo senses your hatred of the named being. Receiving a new _nemesis name_ makes any you already have non-magical.
You gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against the creature named on your tattoo, but this nemesis gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls against you.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command (mental) **Frequency** once per round; **Requirements** You can see your nemesis, and they're within 30 feet of you; **Effect** You focus your hatred into a mental scream. Your nemesis takes 3d6 mental damage, which they can resist with a basic DC 26 Will save. You take half as much damage as your nemesis does, and you can't reduce this damage in any way.
