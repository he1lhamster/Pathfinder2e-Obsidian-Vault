This _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dogslicer|dogslicer]]_ is obviously the work of a brilliant but scrappy artisan who valued versatility over safety. Four toothy gems line the blade's cutting edge, three of which glow—one with fiery red light, one with a chill blue, and one that gives off sparks—while the last is a glistening black. Each of these gems embodies a weapon property rune, but only one rune can be active at a time.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You twist the gem along the blade corresponding with the desired weapon rune: red for [[DATABASE/equipment/Flaming|flaming]], blue for [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost|frost]], or yellow for [[DATABASE/equipment/Shock|shock]]. You take 1d6 damage of the type the chosen rune deals. You can instead twist the black gem to disable the active property rune, taking no damage.
