This _+2 [[Striking]] [[Dogslicer]]_ is obviously the work of a brilliant but scrappy artisan who valued versatility over safety. Four toothy gems line the blade's cutting edge, three of which glow—one with fiery red light, one with a chill blue, and one that gives off sparks—while the last is a glistening black. Each of these gems embodies a weapon property rune, but only one rune can be active at a time.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You twist the gem along the blade corresponding with the desired weapon rune: red for [[Flaming]], blue for [[Frost]], or yellow for [[Shock]]. You take 1d6 damage of the type the chosen rune deals. You can instead twist the black gem to disable the active property rune, taking no damage.
