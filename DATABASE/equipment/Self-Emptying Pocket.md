You never perform to an empty crowd after promising any profits to a phantom in a playhouse, sealed by holes that appear in your pockets. By meeting with the attendees at your events, you can use [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] instead of [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Gather Information|Gather Information]]. When you would use Performance to [[DATABASE/action/Earn Income|Earn Income]], you don't earn any gold pieces, as the money disappears before you can even count it.
 The entity that holds your _bargained contract_ can influence your reception any time you perform for a crowd or Activate the pocket. If they influence your performance favorably, you gain a +2 item bonus to your Performance check. If they influence your performance unfavorably, you gain a -2 item penalty to your Performance check. If you've failed to earn the entity money in quite a while, it typically influences your performance unfavorably.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You exercise all of your charm on a creature, turning a chance meeting into an impromptu performance that commands attention. Attempt a single Performance check against the Perception DC of the creature. On a success, the creature is affected as though by a successful Deception check to [[DATABASE/action/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]]. The entity that holds your contract can influence this performance as well.
