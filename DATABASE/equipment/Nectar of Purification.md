A shimmering liquid, _nectar of purification_ is often stored in bottles similar to those used for vinegar. This oil casts a 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Purify Food and Drink|purify food and drink]] spell over any food or drink onto which it’s poured. The nectar evaporates as it takes effect, leaving the taste and texture of the food or drink unaltered.
