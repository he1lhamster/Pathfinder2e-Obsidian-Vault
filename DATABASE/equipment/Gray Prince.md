While nothing created by the Ash Cult could be considered mass-produced, this _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] ruinous [[DATABASE/weapon/Hand Cannon|hand cannon]]_ is by far their most popular design. The sleek body and intricate carving work make it a favorite accessory of certain aristocrats. The carving isn't merely decorative, however. Rather than a traditional maker's mark, Ornmarr etches excerpts of unreadable text onto each creation, hoping that one day his weapons will sing to another as the silver crystal once sang to him.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, INteract **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You fire a bolt of negative energy, dealing 2d8 negative damage to all creatures in a 60 foot line (DC 24 basic Reflex saving throw). Creatures who critically fail their saving throw also take 1 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent negative damage]] for 1 minute.
