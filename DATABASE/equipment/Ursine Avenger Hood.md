_Note from Nethys: This item is a constituent part of the [[Ursine Avenger Hood]] archetype using the archetype artifact rules._
A gift passed from warrior to warrior, this cowl is made from a [[Cave Bear]] skull and fur. Once invested, the wearer gains a +1 item bonus to [[Nature]] checks to [[Command an Animal]], which increases to +2 if the animal is a [[Bear]]. The wearer of the hood feels a constant longing for the wilderness and wild places and takes a –1 item penalty to all [[Diplomacy]] checks to [[Gather Information]] or [[Make an Impression]] if they go more than 5 days inside a large town or city without spending at least 4 hours in the wilderness.
**Destruction** Soak the _Ursine Avenger Hood_ in the blood of a [[Linnorm]] that is at least 16th level and then burn it in a fire that uses only oak and chrysanthemum as fuel.
