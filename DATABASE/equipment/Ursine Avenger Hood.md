A gift passed from warrior to warrior, this cowl is made from a [[DATABASE/monster/Cave Bear|cave bear's]] skull and fur. Once invested, the wearer gains a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]], which increases to +2 if the animal is a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Bear|bear]]. The wearer of the hood feels a constant longing for the wilderness and wild places and takes a –1 item penalty to all [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Gather Information|Gather Information]] or [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] if they go more than 5 days inside a large town or city without spending at least 4 hours in the wilderness.
**Destruction** Soak the _Ursine Avenger Hood_ in the blood of a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Linnorm|linnorm]] that is at least 16th level and then burn it in a fire that uses only oak and chrysanthemum as fuel.
