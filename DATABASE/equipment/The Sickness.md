_The Sickness_ represents disease of the body or soul. As long as _The Sickness_ is invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to saving throws against disease. If you roll a success on a save against a disease, you get a critical success instead. If you are 20th-level, the item bonus increases to +3.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You flick a corner of the card, as if casting aside a tiny pest or fleck of filth from its surface; you cast [[Abyssal Plague]]. If you are at least 15th-level, you can instead choose to cast [[Spiritual Epidemic]]. Regardless of which spell you cast, the level of the spell is half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is equal to your class DC.
