Not only are owlbear eggs delicious when boiled, but when infused with a mix of alchemical reagents, they also make you emit a long screech much like an owlbear's. All creatures in a 30-foot emanation must attempt a DC 23 Will save. Regardless of the result, creatures in the area are temporarily immune to this screech for 1 minute.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]].
**Failure** The creature is frightened 2.
**Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 3 and [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] for 1 round.
