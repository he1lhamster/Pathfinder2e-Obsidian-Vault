Large turquoise gems stud the outer edge of this sturdy _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Composite Shortbow|composite shortbow]]_. Arrows shot from the bow are unimpaired by wind and air effects.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact (conjuration, teleportation)
**Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You shoot an arrow at an open space on a surface within 500 feet and momentarily vanish into a wind that carries the arrow. You teleport to that location.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact (electricity)
**Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You shoot an arrow at the sky and it tears an extraplanar rift that resembles a storm cloud in a 30-foot burst centered on a point within 200 feet. A torrent of rain pours down from the rift for 1 minute or until you Dismiss the effect. The area within the torrent becomes difficult terrain for all movement (including [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Flying]]). As an Interact action, you can fire an arrow into the rift to cause a bolt of lightning to strike a creature in the area. The creature takes 5d12 lightning damage and must attempt a DC 41 basic Reflex save.
**Activate** 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact) **Frequency** once per week; **Effect** You fire a volley of arrows into the sky. You create the effects of a successful [[DATABASE/ritual/Control Weather|control weather]] ritual.
