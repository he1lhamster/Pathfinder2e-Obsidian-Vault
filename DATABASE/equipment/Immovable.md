**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Your armor anchors you in place, even defying gravity, rendering you [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] until you Dismiss the Activation. while you're immobilized in this way, you can be moved only if a creature succeeds at a DC 40 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Force Open]] your armor. You can also be moved if 8,000 pounds of pressure are placed upon you, though this is likely fatal.
