This dark iron door knocker comes in a variety of shapes, such as a bird clutching a ring in its talons or a gargoyle holding a ring in its mouth. Placing the door knocker on the surface of a door (an Interact action) causes it to attach and remain in place. While in place, the door knocker whispers hints to you while you attempt to unlock the door, granting a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] checks to Pick a Lock. Removing the door knocker from a surface requires you to use an Interact action.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You place the door knocker against a wall, floor, or ceiling. The door knocker fuses in place and creates a usable door within the surface. Any creature can move through the door normally, as if the door had always been there. The door can penetrate up to 1 foot of material, so thick material, such as heavy stone walls, can cause this effect to fail, expending its use for the day. A thin layer of metal in a wall, floor, or ceiling also causes the effect to fail. You can use an Interact action to release the door knocker from the surface and return the surface to its previous shape.
