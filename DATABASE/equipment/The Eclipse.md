_The Eclipse_ represents self-doubt and loss of purpose, as well as a loss of faith. As long as _The Eclipse_ is invested, you gain a +2 item bonus on [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] checks. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision (mental) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** A foe that you're aware of and who is within 60 feet achieves a critical success on a saving throw or a Strike; **Effect** You produce an aura of doubt that overwhelms all foes in a 30-foot emanation and reduces bright light in that area to dim light, as if the region were under an eclipse. The triggering creature's critical success is reduced to a regular success. All further saving throws or Strikes attempted by enemies within the emanation suffer a –2 item penalty; saving throws or Strikes attempted by the triggering enemy suffer a –3 penalty instead. You can sustain this aura of doubt for up to 1 minute.
