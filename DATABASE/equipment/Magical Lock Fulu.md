The symbols on this fulu depict a lock and winding chains. Affixing this fulu over the seam or frame of the target locks it, even if it has no latch or existing lock.
 As many as nine fulus can be applied to the same target. One fulu equates a poor [[DATABASE/equipment/Lock|lock]] (DC 15), three a simple lock (DC 20), and nine an average lock (DC 25).
