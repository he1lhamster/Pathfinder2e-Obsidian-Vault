A _mask of the cursed eye_ is decorated with at least one wide, staring eye. The first time each day a creature on your plane that you can't perceive targets you with a divination spell, the creature must attempt a DC 24 Will save. This effect is automatic and does not require you to Activate the item.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is unaffected. You know you've been targeted with a divination spell, but the mask gives you no additional information.
**Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 minute. You know you've been targeted with a divination spell, but the mask gives you no additional information.
**Critical Failure** The creature is sickened 2 and dazzled for 10 minutes, and the spell is disrupted. You gain a brief mental glimpse of the triggering creature and learn its approximate distance and direction.
