**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that allows understanding of another language, such as [[DATABASE/spell/Comprehend Language|comprehend languages]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Tongues|tongues]]; **Effect** The grimoire absorbs knowledge of one language translated this way (caster's choice if more than one), allowing its bearer to communicate on a rudimentary level in that language even after the spell's duration has elapsed. The _linguist's dictionary_ can hold one language at a time.
