This fine golden oil comes in a small blue canister. Carefully spreading the oil over an object turns it into an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Animated Object|animated object]] of the same type. For example, sprinkling it on a statue makes an [[DATABASE/monster/Animated Statue|animated statue]]. If the animated object's level would be greater than 3, the oil struggles to animate it and ultimately fails.
 This animated object has the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for the current turn as part of the activation. The object remains animated for 1 minute before falling inert. As usual, you can have a maximum of four minions under your control.
