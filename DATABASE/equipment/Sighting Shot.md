Eyes are carved onto a _sighting shot_. When you Activate the ammunition, it glows, shedding bright light for 20 feet and dim light for 20 feet beyond that. If you shot the activated ammunition, your mind swirls with images of what the _sighting shot_ passed and hit as if you sprinted along the ammunition's course. You see this path as if with your normal visual senses. Once a _sighting shot_ hits anything or reaches its maximum range, it stops transmitting images to you. A _sighting shot's_ light is visible to creatures who didn't Activate the ammunition, but they receive no special information from it.
