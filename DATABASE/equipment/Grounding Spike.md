Metal caps the bottom of this _+1 [[Striking]] [[Thundering]] [[Dancer's Spear]]_ and its point gives off the faint smell of ozone. If you hit a target that has been struck by a _[[Polarizing Mace]]_ within the last round, you deal additional electricity damage to the target equal to the number of _grounding spike's_ damage dice. If you critically hit such a target, the creature is [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of your next turn.
 **Special** The _grounding spike_ pairs with the _polarizing mace_.
