Metal caps the bottom of this _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Thundering|thundering]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dancer's Spear|dancer's spear]]_ and its point gives off the faint smell of ozone. If you hit a target that has been struck by a _[[DATABASE/equipment/Polarizing Mace|polarizing mace]]_ within the last round, you deal additional electricity damage to the target equal to the number of _grounding spike's_ damage dice. If you critically hit such a target, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of your next turn.
 **Special** The _grounding spike_ pairs with the _polarizing mace_.
