Sovereign steel armor sickens certain creatures that touch it. A creature with weakness to [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron|cold iron]] that critically fails an unarmed attack against a creature in sovereign steel armor becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]], and such a creature is sickened 1 as long as it wears sovereign steel armor. The [[DATABASE/equipment/Noqual|noqual]] in sovereign steel armor provides protection against magic, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against spell attack rolls. If you Cast a Spell while wearing sovereign steel armor, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the spell fails.
