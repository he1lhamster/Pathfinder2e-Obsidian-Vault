Made from a special mixture of honey and alchemical reagents, poison fizz is a zesty, sweet rock candy that pops and crackles in your mouth. For 1 hour, you have an item bonus to saving throws against poison and being [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]].
 **Secondary Effect** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (poison) **Effect** You bite the poison fizz to release its poisonous liquid center and spray green mist in a 15-foot cone. This deals poison damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails is also [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] until the end of your next turn and is then temporarily immune to being blinded by poison fizz for 1 hour.
