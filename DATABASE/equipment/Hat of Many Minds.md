This pointy, brimmed hat made up of a rainbow patchwork of various materials seems to sit just a little lopsided on your head, no matter how you adjust it. You gain a +2 item bonus to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Earn Income|Earn Income]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You tear off a patch of cloth to manifest it into a copy of yourself, dressed in the color and fabric of the patch. The copy follows your specific instructions and performs a single, straightforward task for up to 30 minutes. It takes the copy three times as long to complete the task as it would you, meaning it can perform a task that would take you a maximum of 10 minutes. It doesn't react quickly enough to be of any use during an encounter, and it can't use your spells or other special abilities—just basic actions and skill actions.
 The copy disappears and returns to the hat as a piece of cloth when the given task has been completed, or when you Dismiss the activation.
