Elegant jewelry such as the _master magus ring_ adorns experienced [[Magus]]. Each ring has a significant metal and symbol to represent a particular hybrid study, such as a heavy iron ring with an icon of a mountain for [[Inexorable Iron]], or glittering silver with a shield-like emblem for [[Sparkling Targe]]. You gain a +2 item bonus to [[Arcana]] checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast a magus conflux spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The ring transports you and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to an unoccupied space you can see within a range equal to your Speed. If this would bring another creature with you—even if you're carrying it in an extradimensional container—the activation fails and is used.
**Craft Requirements** You are a magus.
