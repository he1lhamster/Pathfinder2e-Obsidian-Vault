These boots act as [[DATABASE/equipment/Boots of Elvenkind|greater boots of elvenkind]], but they react wildly to strong physical exertion. While you wear the boots, the curse activates whenever you attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check or Stride more than once in a single round during an encounter. The boots cast an 8th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Uncontrollable Dance|uncontrollable dance]] spell on you, and you automatically fail your save. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.
