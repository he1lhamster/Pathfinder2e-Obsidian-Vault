These boots act as [[Boots of Elvenkind]], but they react wildly to strong physical exertion. While you wear the boots, the curse activates whenever you attempt an [[Athletics]] check or Stride more than once in a single round during an encounter. The boots cast an 8th-level [[Uncontrollable Dance]] spell on you, and you automatically fail your save. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.
