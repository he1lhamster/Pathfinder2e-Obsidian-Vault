This magical book has its official title, _The Grimoire of Lady Jayne Cutter_, written on an inside page in illuminated letters. Among occultists and other scholars, it's known by its colloquial name: the _Hunter's Hagbook_. The book is a grimoire created and used by a legendary Varisian monster hunter. The _Hunter's Hagbook_ can hold 100 spells but the following spells are always present in the book, can't be removed from it, and count against the total: [[DATABASE/spell/Blind Eye|blind eye]], [[DATABASE/spell/Blood Duplicate|blood duplicate]], [[DATABASE/spell/Caster's Imposition|caster's imposition]], [[DATABASE/spell/Hag's Fruit|hag's fruit]], [[DATABASE/spell/Ritual Obstruction|ritual obstruction]], [[DATABASE/spell/Web of Influence|web of influence]]
 When you attempt a saving throw against a [[DATABASE/monsterability/Coven|coven]] spell, you can immediately end the duration of a spell affecting you that you prepared from this book. If you do, the result of your saving throw is one degree of success better than your roll (for example, a critical failure becomes a failure).
