Rather than passing on when they feel their death approaching, a rare few elderly [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Arboreal|arboreals]] undergo a ritual of preservation. This rite fuses the arboreal's consciousness into a branch, allowing their spirit to live on within the object. The branch functions as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Verdant Staff|greater verdant staff]], though the arboreal spirit allows only partners willing to safeguard nature to use the staff's spells. An arboreal who decides to become an _arboreal staff_ is more connected to shorter-lived species than others of their kind. Most choose to endure to share their knowledge with future generations, but they take a long view in ways that can be frustrating to their wielders.
 In addition to the activation and spells of a _greater verdant staff_, an _arboreal staff_ can cast the spells it holds as if it were the staff's wielder, though it usually does so only to benefit a partner. The staff also has [[DATABASE/spell/Earthbind|earthbind]] available as a 3rd-level spell.
