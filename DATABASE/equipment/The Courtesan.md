_The Courtesan_ represents political intrigue and social niceties. As long as _The Courtesan_ is invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You pass the card over your face and become exactly who you need to be; you cast [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Disguise|illusory disguise]]. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level). You can change your appearance again at any time during the duration by using a three-action activity, which has the concentrate trait. While under these effects, your [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] are one degree of success greater when you use them against a creature that is a lower level than yourself.
