This talisman is the magically treated corpse of a tiny bat bound in papyrus. When you activate the bat, the affixed weapon detects vibrations around you and guides your perception. You gain the benefits of the fighter [[Blind-Fight]] class feat for 1 minute.
 If you have the Blind-Fight feat, you gain imprecise echolocation with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. This makes creatures that would be undetected by you because you can’t see them hidden instead.
