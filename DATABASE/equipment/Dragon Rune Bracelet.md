A _dragon rune bracelet_ is a gold bangle formed around the scale of a famous dragon. The bracelet is etched with esoteric symbols or words in [[DATABASE/language/Draconic|Draconic]] that indicate kinship with dragons. As many types of _dragon rune bracelet_ exist as there are types of dragons, though bracelets associated with uncommon or rare dragons have the same rarity as the dragon.
 While wearing a _dragon rune bracelet_, you gain a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks while interacting with dragons of the same type as the bracelet's scale (such as [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Red|red dragons]] or [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Cloud|cloud dragons]]). You also gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects from any kind of dragon.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can spend only to cast a [[DATABASE/class_/Sorcerer|sorcerer]] [[DATABASE/sorcererbloodline/Draconic|draconic bloodline]] spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.
**Craft Requirements** You are a sorcerer of a draconic bloodline.
