---
This _+2 [[Striking]] [[Fearsome]] [[Arquebus]]_ is composed of warped and twisted wood engraved with eerie runes. When the weapon fires, the blast sometimes sounds like the cackling of a diabolical witch.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You afflict a creature you can see with a hex of _impending doom_. The hex lasts for 1 minute. As long as the creature is hexed, when you hit it with a round from the hex blaster, the creature must attempt a DC 28 Will save at the end of your turn; the creature attempts a single Will save regardless of the number of times you hit it.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[Frightened]]. It also takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]].
**Failure** The creature is frightened 2. It also takes 2d6 persistent mental damage.
**Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 2 and [[Slowed]] for 1 minute. It also takes 4d6 persistent mental damage and is cursed with a hex of _impending doom_. If the target falls [[Unconscious]] from damage dealt by this Strike or the persistent mental damage, it remains unconscious for 1 day or until this curse is removed. After 1 day, if the creature is still unconscious, it must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or die; this effect has the death and incapacitation traits.
