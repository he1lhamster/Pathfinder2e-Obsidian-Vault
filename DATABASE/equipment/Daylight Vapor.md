This heavier-than-air mist emits a soft glow. While this poison lasts, it causes its victims to shine from within with agonizing, brilliant radiance. This effect has the light trait (although the poison itself doesn't, so only the light effect can be counteracted by darkness effects). The [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] condition from _daylight vapor_ can't be removed while the poison lasts, and when the victim enters an area of magical darkness, the poison attempts to counteract the darkness with a counteract modifier of +21. If the poison fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same darkness again. 
**Saving Throw** DC 31 Fortitude; **Onset** 1 round; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 4d6 poison damage and sickened 1 (1 round); **Stage 2** 6d6 poison damage and sickened 2 (1 round); **Stage 3** 10d6 damage and sickened 3 (1 round)
**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of [[DATABASE/spell/Sunburst|sunburst]].
