A famed detective once owned the long, curved _sleuth's pipe_, taking it with them on investigations, keeping it in hand or mouth while cogitating. The pipe might have passed down through generations. Or, when an owner dies without heirs, it could go up for auction, be given to family friends, or remain at the scene of a crime to be found later. The _sleuth's pipe_ has sapience that eventually awakens, allowing the relic to act as a helpful assistant in investigations. Even while this sapience sleeps within the pipe, it grants you a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]], and if you're an [[DATABASE/class_/Investigator|investigator]], any checks you make to [[DATABASE/action/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]].
