Originally formulated as a means of dissolving sovereign glue, this powerful solvent can break almost any adhesive's grip. As universal solvent is particularly effective against [[DATABASE/equipment/Sovereign Glue|sovereign glue]], it automatically dissolves sovereign glue. It attempts to counteract any other adhesives, such as [[DATABASE/spell/Tanglefoot|tanglefoot bags]], with a counteract modifier depending on the type.
