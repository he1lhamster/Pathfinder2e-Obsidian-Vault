This heavy, 12-foot-tall _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Composite Longbow|composite longbow]]_ is fashioned from mammoth tusks lashed together. Due to its great size, you can attack with the _Mammoth Bow_ only if you're Large or larger. The _Mammoth Bow_ deals 2d6 additional piercing damage because of its incredible, magically enhanced draw power. Additionally, the Mammoth Bow has a 180-foot range increment instead of a 100-foot range increment, but its volley range increases from 30 feet to 50 feet.
