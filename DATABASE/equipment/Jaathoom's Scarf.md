This scarf is made of fine silk that's the same shade of blue as a clear, cloudless sky. The short ends are edged with a fine gold fringe that seems to sway even in still weather as though touched by invisible winds. The long edges have exquisite embroidery in threads that vary from a blue identical to the silk to the deep gray of storm clouds during winter. Wearing this scarf grants a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks to dance and to [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]].
**Activate****—Vanish** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The scarf casts 4th-rank [[DATABASE/spell/Invisibility|invisibility]] on you.
**Activate****—Jaathoom's Rebuke** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate); **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You let the winds around you catch the edges of the _jaathoom's scarf_, and a jaathoom shuyookh appears with a sudden updraft. The winds force your enemies back, granting you some breathing room in battle. Each enemy in a 10-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or be pushed 10 feet. A creature that critically fails is also knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] after being moved. Creatures with the air trait are immune to all these effects.
