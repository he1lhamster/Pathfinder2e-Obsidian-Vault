An _energizing treat_ is a treat made from meat or grains. When you feed your animal companion or familiar an energizing treat, it's [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] for 1 minute. It can use the extra action each round only for Strike, Stride, and [[DATABASE/action/Support|Support]] actions, and it can do so only if it normally has those actions available and you take the proper action to command it.
