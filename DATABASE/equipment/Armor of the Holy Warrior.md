Based on the armors used by the holy warriors who served under General Arnisant in the Shining Crusade, this well-polished _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Resilient|greater resilient]] [[DATABASE/armor/Half Plate|half plate]]_ is decorated with religious motifs and carved with sacred scripture. While wearing _armor of the holy warrior_, your item bonus from the _greater resilient_ rune increases from +2 to +3; if you upgrade to a _major resilient_ rune, the item bonus instead increases from +3 to +4. An undead that critically fails an unarmed attack against you while you wear this armor takes 1d6 positive damage.
 If you are evil, you're [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] while wearing the armor. If you're undead, you also take 2d6 positive damage each round that you wear the armor.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The armor casts the three-action version of a 6th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] spell.
