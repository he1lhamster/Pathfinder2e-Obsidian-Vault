This piece of bronzite is shaped like an oval with points at both ends. It has a carved flame at its center and is traditionally worn over the heart. You can activate only one _flame navette_ per day. When you activate the navette, you gain the benefit of the fighter’s [[DATABASE/feat/Determination|Determination]] class feat, with a counteract modifier of +22. If you have the Determination feat, you can use your own modifier if it’s better.
