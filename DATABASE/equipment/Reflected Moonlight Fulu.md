An acolyte accidentally left fulu paper outdoors overnight during a divine ceremony to [[DATABASE/deity/Tsukiyo|Tsukiyo]] conducted only during a supermoon, creating the first _reflected moonlight fulu_. When you Activate this fulu, you reroll your saving throw against the triggering effect and take the better result. If this new roll is a critical success, the effect is reflected on its creator, who's treated as the effect's target, with any negative damage converted to positive. A reflected effect or spell affects only the original creator, even if it was an area spell or one that affects more than one creature.
