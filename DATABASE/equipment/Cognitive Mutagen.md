Your mind becomes clear and cognition flows freely, but physical matters seem ephemeral. 
**Benefit** You gain an item bonus to Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, and Society checks and all checks to Recall Knowledge. Your critical failures on Recall Knowledge checks become failures instead. 
**Drawback** You take a –2 penalty to weapon and unarmed attack rolls, Athletics checks, and Acrobatics checks. You can carry 2 less Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered, and the maximum Bulk you can carry is reduced by 4.
