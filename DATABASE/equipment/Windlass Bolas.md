Clockwork mechanisms tick away inside the weights of these _+1 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Bola]]_, spooling out more cord in midair.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The cord of the bola snakes out as you throw it, allowing the weapon to wrap around a group of enemies. You use the bolas to attempt a ranged [[Trip]] against all creatures in a 5-foot radius burst within the weapon's first range increment. Roll a separate [[Athletics]] check for each target. Each attempt counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all the attempts.
