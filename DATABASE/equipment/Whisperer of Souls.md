This _+4 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|major striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Brilliant|greater brilliant]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Keen|keen]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Glaive|glaive]]_ binds the souls of powerful creatures it slays. The soul can't be returned to life by any means while imprisoned within the glaive and can be freed only by a deed of great benevolence or selflessness. While using the glaive as a weapon, whenever you reduce a sapient creature of 18th level or higher to 0 Hit Points or roll a critical success with a Strike against such a target, the creature must attempt a DC 50 Fortitude save.
 
**Critical Success** No additional effect.
**Success** The glaive siphons the creature's essence, rendering it [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]]. If the creature dies from the Strike or while drained in this way, the creature's soul is bound in the glaive.
**Failure** As success, but the creature is drained 2.
**Critical Failure** As success, but the creature is drained 4.
 The glaive also has the following activations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Trigger** You Strike with the _Whisperer of Souls_; **Effect** You choose whether the Strike deals lethal or nonlethal damage. If the glaive has a reason for doing so, such as slaying a creature whose soul the glaive can absorb, it can defy your choice if you fail a DC 50 Will save.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Trigger** You attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Decipher Writing|Decipher Writing]], [[DATABASE/action/Identify Magic|Identify Magic]], [[DATABASE/action/Learn a Spell|Learn a Spell]], or [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]; **Effect** You listen to eldritch secrets the weapon whispers, gaining a +4 item bonus to the triggering check.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command, envision, Interact **Frequency** once per week; **Effect** Attempt an Occultism check as if you cast the [[DATABASE/ritual/Legend Lore|legend lore]] ritual about a subject. If you roll a success or critical success, you can repeat what the _Whisperer of Souls_ relates to you about the subject. On a critical failure, you and the glaive are drawn into a murmuring void of cold, where your mind is assaulted by strange visions for an entire week. At the end of this time, you reappear and must attempt a DC 50 Will save.
**Success** When you return, you can retrain one of your skills into a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill about evil creatures or places, as if you had spent 1 week retraining.
**Failure** As success, but you are [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]] for 1 week.
**Critical Failure** As success, but your alignment moves one step toward evil and you must retrain one of your skills into a Lore about evil creatures or places. You become obsessed with increasing your forbidden knowledge, turning to wicked forces that offer such secrets and compromising your morals further if you must.
**Destruction** If the _Whisperer of Souls_ is used to slay [[DATABASE/deity/Shelyn|Shelyn's]] herald, it disintegrates, bringing about great evil in its wake.
