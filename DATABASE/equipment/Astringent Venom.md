This oily, dark-purple powder gives off the distinct odor of boiled leather. When delivered, the poison acts quickly to constrict the victim's blood flow to their extremities and turn their lungs into a soft jelly. A victim of astringent venom is recognizable by the frostbite-like hue of their hands as they lose circulation to their extremities, making it difficult for them to hold things. Each round at the beginning of their turn, a creature affected by astringent venom must succeed at a flat DC 5 check or drop one random item they're holding.
 **Saving Throw** DC 32 Fortitude; **Onset** 1 round; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 6d6 poison damage (1 round); **Stage 2** 8d6 poison damage (1 round); **Stage 3** 10d6 poison damage and [[Confused]] (1 round)
