These heavy boots are made of blackened metal and always feel warm to the touch, with streams of glowing embers cascading off their heels. While wearing _hellfire boots_, you gain resistance 10 to fire damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** Stride. Each square you move through during your Stride is scorched with hellish flames, becoming hazardous terrain for 1 minute. A creature that moves through one of these spaces takes 3d6 fire damage.
