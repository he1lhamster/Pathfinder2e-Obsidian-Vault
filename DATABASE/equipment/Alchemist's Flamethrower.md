This long cylinder is topped by a pair of brass sockets and a collection of polished pipes and tubes. A total of two vials of [[DATABASE/equipment/Alchemist's Fire|alchemist's fire]] must be loaded into the sockets at the base of the weapon and the tubes cleaned and primed. Properly loading the flamethrower in this way takes 1 minute. When the trigger on a loaded flamethrower is pulled, the alchemist's fire is siphoned into the rifle and shot out of the muzzle in a line of fire. The damage dealt by a flamethrower is determined by the strength of the weakest alchemist's fire loaded into the flamethrower.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact (fire) **Requirements** The flamethrower is loaded; **Effect** You pull the trigger, expending both loaded alchemist's fires to shoot a line of fire. Creatures in the area take fire damage based on the weakest alchemist's fire loaded into the flamethrower, as noted below. Creatures that critically fail the basic Reflex save additionally take the listed persistent fire damage.

* **Lesser Alchemist's Fire**: The flamethrower deals 1d8 fire damage (DC 15 basic Reflex save) in a 30-foot line. 1 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]].
* **Moderate Alchemist's Fire**: The flamethrower deals 2d8 fire damage (DC 17 basic Reflex save) in a 60-foot line. 2 persistent fire damage.
* **Greater Alchemist's Fire**: The flamethrower deals 6d8 fire damage (DC 28 basic Reflex save) in a 90-foot line. 3 persistent fire damage.
* **Major Alchemist's Fire**: The flamethrower deals 10d8 fire damage (DC 37 basic Reflex save) in a 120-foot line. 4 persistent fire damage.
