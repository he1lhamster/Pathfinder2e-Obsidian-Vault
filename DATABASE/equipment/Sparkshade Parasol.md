This large magical parasol shields you from the heat in hot environments, no matter whether the heat comes from above, like the beating sun, or below, like roiling lava. While holding the _sparkshade parasol_, you gain resistance 10 to fire and are protected from mild, severe, and extreme environmental heat.
**Activate****—Parasol's Protection** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (manipulate); **Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Trigger** You're targeted by or inside the area of an effect that deals fire damage; **Effect** You hold your parasol between yourself and the incoming flames, gaining fire resistance 20 against the triggering effect. (This applies only to any damage the effect deals.) For the next 1 minute, flames dance harmlessly along the parasol's brim, letting you use Parasol's Pyrotechnics.
**Activate****—Parasol's Pyrotechnics** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate); **Requirements** Flames are dancing on the sparkshade parasol due to you using Parasol's Protection; **Effect** You release captured flames out from your parasol, shooting fire in a 30-foot line. Each creature in the line takes 10d6 fire damage (DC 28 basic Reflex save). This activation loses its charge.
