This triangular prism showing swirling black patterns inside constantly moves around on your armor, no matter where you affix it. As part of the process of Affixing this Talisman, you attune it to a single item of 1 Bulk or less. When you activate this talisman, the attuned item immediately teleports into your hand.
 The _retrieval prism_ can't retrieve an item that's not on your plane, including one that's in an extradimensional space like a [[DATABASE/equipment/Bag of Holding|bag of holding]]. If you haven't expended the talisman, you can attune it to a different item by Affixing the Talisman again.
