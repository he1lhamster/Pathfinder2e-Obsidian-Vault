Heavenly radiance shines from an active _celestial staff,_ a golden staff capped with a pair of sculpted [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Angel|angel's]] wings. Used as a weapon, the staff is a _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy|holy]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Staff|staff]]_. While wielding a _celestial staff_, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that have the evil trait and effects created by evil creatures. When you prepare this staff, if you're evil, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] until your next daily preparations. 
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
