Activating this black powder–infused alchemical bandage cauterizes wounds. You can apply a searing suture to yourself or an adjacent willing creature as you activate it. The target creature takes 1d6 fire damage and can immediately attempt a flat check to remove the [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]—the DC of this flat check depends on the type of searing suture applied. When applied against a bleed effect that is lower level than the searing suture, the flat check is automatically successful.
