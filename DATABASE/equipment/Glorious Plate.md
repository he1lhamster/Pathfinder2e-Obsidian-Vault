This elegant [[DATABASE/armor/Full Plate|full plate]] is embossed with heraldic imagery and never tarnishes or loses its shine. _Glorious plate_ is _+2 resilient full plate_. In battle, _glorious plate_ sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, which enemies see as a blinding halo that obscures creatures other than the wearer. When an enemy looks at the wearer, it must attempt a DC 33 Will saving throw. The enemy is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Success** The enemy is unaffected.
**Failure** For 1 minute, the wearer’s allies within the glorious plate’s 10-foot radius of light are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] to the enemy. Allies are concealed only while they remain within the light; if allies enter the light later, they are concealed as well.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the wearer’s allies are [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to the enemy instead of concealed.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact ; **Effect** The armor casts [[DATABASE/spell/Sanctuary|sanctuary]] on you.
