A fury cocktail is a fortifying ginger beer spiked with rum and a mixer. It's rumored to have originated from a barbarian-themed festival in a popular mead hall specializing in alchemical beverages.
 **Benefit** You gain an item bonus to melee attack rolls and an additional effect depending on the additive chosen when the brew is created.

* **Animalistic** Lemon juice and powdered claws or talons are added to the cocktail. You gain an unarmed attack in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] group of your choice between a jaws attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage or a claw attack that has the agile trait and deals 1d4 slashing damage.
* **Double** This cocktail is just stronger, with more ginger and more rum. You gain resistance 1 to physical damage. The resistance increases to 2 for a moderate fury cocktail or 5 for a greater fury cocktail.
* **Mournful** A few flower petals add a powerful aroma to the drink. You gain resistance 1 to negative damage, or resistance 1 to positive damage if you have negative healing. The resistance increases to 5 for a moderate fury cocktail or 10 for a greater fury cocktail.
* **Skeptical** A splash of bitters gives the drink a more complex flavor. You gain a +1 item bonus to saves against magic. This bonus is +2 for a moderate fury cocktail or +3 for a greater fury cocktail.
* **Titanic** Yuzu juice and powdered giant hair are added to this cocktail. If you're Medium or smaller, you gain the following effects: you become Large, are [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]], and increase your reach by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny).
* **Wyrmhide** Pomegranate juice and elemental reagents are added to the cocktail. You gain resistance 1 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and poison damage. The resistance increases to 5 for a moderate fury cocktail or 10 for a greater fury cocktail.

**Drawback** You take a –1 penalty to AC and a –2 penalty to Reflex saves.
