This _+2 resilient [[DATABASE/armor/Padded Armor|padded armor]]_ is woven from many strands of gut cord strung with dried organs and preserved [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Xulgath|xulgath]] scent glands. When worn, it infuses your body with a ghastly and nauseating flavor.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Trigger** You are grabbed or are hit by an unarmed attack; **Effect** Your attacker must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude saving throw. Creatures with a stench aura, such as [[DATABASE/monster/Otyugh|otyughs]] and xulgaths, are immune to this effect.
**Success** The creature is unaffected and is immune to the effects of the noxious jerkin for 1 minute.
**Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1.]]
**Critical Failure** The creature is sickened 1 and is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round.
