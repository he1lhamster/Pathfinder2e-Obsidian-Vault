This _+2 [[Striking]] [[Shifting]] [[Shortsword]]_ is formed of rapidly vibrating air and magical energy, though it uses the same statistics as iron. The wooden hilt is adorned with four gems, representing the energies of acid, cold, fire, and electricity, that sparkle in sequence at random intervals.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> Interact **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You draw magical energy from one of the gems. Roll 1d4. Until the start of your next turn, the weapon gains the corresponding rune: 1—[[Corrosive]], 2—[[Flaming]], 3—[[Frost]], or 4—[[Shock]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** The blade has an energy rune from the first activation; **Effect** You call upon the energy stored in the blade to explode outward. The blade of four energies casts a 5th-level spell that depends on the active rune: [[Acid Arrow]] for _corrosive_, [[Fireball]] for _flaming_, [[Cone of Cold]] for _frost_, or [[Lightning Bolt]] for _shock_.
