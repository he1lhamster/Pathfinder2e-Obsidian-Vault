Creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter with a [[DATABASE/monster/Horned Archon|horned archon]] scout who sought to peacefully restrain their foes. When an activated _antler arrow_ hits a target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Bow|bow]].
 If the hit with the _antler arrow_ is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check increases to 15.
