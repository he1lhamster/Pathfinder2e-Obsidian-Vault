The thin, glittering strands of rope that comprise this thick belt appear to be spun gold. Strung along the front of the belt are a collection of four multicolored, perfectly spherical beads: jade, turquoise, quartz, and amethyst. While wearing the lash, you gain a +3 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]]. When you invest the belt, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact ; **Effect** You touch one of the jewels affixed to the sage's lash and speak a command word. Depending on the jewel, a different effect is produced that affects you and all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation. After the effect occurs, all four jewels disappear from the lash, reappearing at the next dawn.

* **Jade** (healing, positive) Speak “purity” to produce a wave of green light that ends any [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] condition and any [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|ongoing poison damage]] affecting creatures in the emanation.
* **Turquoise** Speak “clarity” to grant all affected a +2 status bonus to their next Will save for 1 minute.
* **Quartz** (healing, positive) Speak “lenity” to have each creature regain 30 Hit Points.
* **Amethyst** (divination, light, revelation) Speak “verity” to emit a magical trail of light from the lash that reveals the location of each creature in the emanation. For 1 round, if they would be [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], they become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] instead, and if they would be [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Unnoticed|unnoticed]] by a creature, they're [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] instead. A creature can attempt a DC 43 [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check to avoid the lash's detection.
