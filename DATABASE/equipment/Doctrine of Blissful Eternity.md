The bones of small animals decorate the cover of this tome, creating a pattern that resembles a gross perversion of [[Pharasma]] holy symbol.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** An undead minion you summoned or created using a spell prepared from this grimoire takes damage that would bring it to 0 Hit Points; **Effect** You call out and demand the undead to remain, reaching out with tendrils of negative energy that preserves your minion so it might continue to serve you. Expend a spell slot in which you've prepared a [[Harm]] spell to restore 1d8 Hit Points to your undead minion per level of the expended spell slot, before applying the damage. If this prevents the minion from being reduced to 0 Hit Points, it isn't destroyed.
