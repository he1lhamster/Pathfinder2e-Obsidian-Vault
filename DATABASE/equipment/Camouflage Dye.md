Camouflage dye uses a variety of alchemically treated paints and crushed crystals to make the user particularly hard to distinguish from their surroundings. When you Activate the dye by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach, the target and its clothing change colors, blending into their surroundings until the target makes a sudden movement. The target can [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]] without cover or [[Concealed]] for 10 minutes. If the target uses a hostile action or moves at more than half its Speed, after that action is completed, the effects of camouflage powder end and the creature ceases to be [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]].
