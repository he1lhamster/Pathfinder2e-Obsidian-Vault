A _floating shield_ is usually carved with wing motifs. This [[DATABASE/shield/Buckler|buckler]] (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12) can protect you on its own.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The shield magically releases itself and floats off your arm into the air next to you, granting you its bonus automatically, as if you had [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raised the Shield]]. Because you’re not wielding the shield, you can’t use reactions such as [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] with the shield, but you gain its benefits even when using both of your hands. After 1 minute, the shield drops to the ground, ending its floating effect. While the shield is adjacent to you, you can Interact to grasp it, ending its floating effect early.
