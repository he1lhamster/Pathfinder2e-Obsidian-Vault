An encounter with a [[DATABASE/monster/Toshigami|toshigami]], the enigmatic [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Kami|kami]] who protect cherry trees, is rare, though often sought after and treasured by those who achieve such an encounter. Only a handful of mortals can truthfully claim to have seen a toshigami, let alone met one, though many popular fireside tales tell of virtuous souls receiving a toshigami's blessing to fight for a worthy cause. Such stories have a basis in fact; every so often, a toshigami gives a worthy mortal a flower from their ward, time-locked in perfect bloom and granted sapience. Such _toshigami blossoms_ are more sociable than their creators. Like toshigami, a blossom has a strong curiosity about the mortal world. If you wear a _toshigami blossom_, it can intercede for you, helping you make a good impression.
 A _toshigami blossom_ has the following activations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The blossom casts [[DATABASE/spell/Tree Stride|tree stride]] on you to your specifications. If you target only cherry trees, the spell is cast at 6th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The blossom casts [[DATABASE/spell/Soothing Blossoms|soothing blossoms]] to your specifications.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** The blossom sends a flurry of cherry blossoms outward in a 20-foot burst that lasts 1 round. You and your allies can see through these blossoms. To all other creatures, creatures within the cloud of blossoms become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. When you or an ally succeeds with a Strike against a creature in the blossoms, the Strike deals an additional 1d6 mental damage and an additional 1d6 negative damage to living creatures, or an additional 1d6 positive damage to undead.
