Originally created as a means of slaying the legendary jabberwock, _vorpal_ weapons prove equally effective against nearly any foe with a head.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision (death, incapacitation) **Trigger** You roll a natural 20 on a Strike with the weapon, critically succeed, and deal slashing damage. The target must have a head; **Effect** The target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude save or be decapitated. This kills any creature except ones that don’t require a head to live. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head.
