An _exploration lens_ is a magical glass lens designed for a [[Lantern]]. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern. You can find more information about exploration activities related to these lenses on page 496 of the Core Rulebook. Alternatively, an _exploration lens_ can be installed in a [[Wayfinder]] like an [[Aeon Stone]]. In this case, light (such as that from a lantern, [[Torch]], or [[Light]] spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the _wayfinder_ in your hand for it to function.
 There are several different types of exploration lens, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.

## Exploration Lens (Detecting)<span class="item-type">Item 10</span>

**Source** [[Pathfinder 171. Hurricane's Howl]]
**Price** 1,000 gp
When held up to light, this lens sparkles as though infused with glitter. While [[Detect Magic]] in exploration mode, when the lantern's light falls upon something you detect as magical, it pulsates faintly. This makes it easier to triangulate the magic, since you can use the cone of the bull's-eye lantern instead of the circular pulse of [[Detect Magic]]. You also gain a +2 item bonus to checks to [[Identify Magic]] within the light.

## Exploration Lens (Investigating)<span class="item-type">Item 12</span>

**Source** [[Pathfinder 171. Hurricane's Howl]]
**Price** 1,750 gp
The outer rim of this lens glows faintly when held up to the light. While activated, the lens grants you a +1 item bonus to skill checks to [[Recall Knowledge]] while [[Investigate]] by outlining potential clues in a way that triggers your memory. If you're Investigating something while using the lens, you can always roll a Recall Knowledge skill check appropriate to the investigation for initiative.

## Exploration Lens (Searching)<span class="item-type">Item 14</span>

**Source** [[Pathfinder 171. Hurricane's Howl]]
**Price** 4,000 gp
This lens has an opalescent sheen when held up to light. The lens subtly outlines hidden doors and concealed hazards, granting you a +2 item bonus to Perception checks to spot such features while [[Search]]. Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search.
