An etching of some aquatic beast dragging a figure beneath the waves adorns the ivory of a _whelming scrimshaw_. When you Activate this item, you break it and choose one creature within 30 feet. The target must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save; amphibious and aquatic creatures are immune.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The target becomes [[Sickened]] and unable to breathe until this sickened condition ends.
**Failure** As success, but sickened 2.
**Critical Failure** As success, but sickened 3.
