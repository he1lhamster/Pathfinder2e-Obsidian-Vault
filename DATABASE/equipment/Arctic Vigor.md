This tattoo takes the shape of the face of a roaring polar bear with piercing, ice-blue eyes. You don't take damage from extreme cold or severe cold.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You call forth a blast of polar wind in a 10-foot burst within a range of 30 feet that deals 7d6 cold damage. All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 27 basic Fortitude save.

**Price** 6,000 gp
The damage of your polar wind increases to 12d6, the range increases to 60 feet, and you can choose to increase the radius to 15 or 20 feet. While exposed to incredible cold, you only take minor cold damage every hour, instead of moderate cold damage every minute. You ignore the uneven ground and difficult terrain caused by ice and the difficult terrain caused by snow (reducing greater difficult terrain from ice or snow to normal difficult terrain).
