Orichalcum weapons can have four magic property runes instead of three. Due to orichalcum’s temporal properties, etching the [[DATABASE/equipment/Speed|speed]] weapon property rune onto an orichalcum weapon costs half the normal Price (though transferring the rune to a weapon made of another material requires you to first pay the remaining Price and then pay the cost to transfer).
