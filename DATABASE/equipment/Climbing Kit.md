# Climbing Kit<span class="item-type">Item 0+</span>

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Price** 5 sp
**Hands** 2; **Bulk** 1

This satchel includes 50 feet of rope, pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you're [[Climb]], moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a DC 5 flat check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit. If you wear your climbing kit, you can access it as part of a Climb action.
