The pages of this part-spellbook, part-bestiary are illustrated with all manner of creatures, magical and mundane. The illustrations shift and move around the page when examined.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision (metamagic) ; **Effect** If your next action is to cast a conjuration spell prepared from this grimoire that summons one or more creatures, you summon creatures from the _illuminated folio_ rather than their usual source. These summoned creatures appear as living illustrations, granting them resistance to physical damage equal to half their level and weakness 5 to fire and to any ability with the water trait. They can also fold themselves up to pass through spaces only an inch or so wide as part of their movement.
