Your features become thin and angular. You become swifter and nimbler, but your body also becomes fragile.
 **Benefit** You gain an item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] checks, [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks, [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] checks, Reflex saves, and Dexterity-based attack rolls, and you gain the listed status bonus to your Speed.
 **Drawback** You take damage equal to twice your level; you can't recover Hit Points lost in this way by any means while the mutagen lasts. You take a –2 penalty to Fortitude saves
