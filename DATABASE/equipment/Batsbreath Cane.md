A specialized _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Thundering|thundering]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Probing Cane|probing cane]]_ made from strengthened spruce wood, a _batsbreath cane_ is distinctive for its brass tip. The tip covers a small hollow in the wood that houses quartz crystals infused with latent storm magic.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You strike the cane firmly against the ground, causing a pin within the brass tip to tap the crystals and emit a sonic pulse. The pulse reverberates in a 60-foot radius for the next minute, with the cane acting as an antenna to receive the echoes. For 1 minute, as long as you remain in the area and are holding the cane, you gain hearing as a precise sense.
