This intricately carved quartz wand changes color, cycling through the colors of the rainbow.
**Activate** Cast a Spell **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge; **Effect** You cast [[Chromatic Armor]] of the indicated level. Additionally, the target can use the Chromatic Armor Burst action.
 **Chromatic Armor Burst** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, evocation, light, magical); **Requirements** You're affected by _chromatic armor_ created by the _wand of chromatic burst_; **Effect** Choose one color of the _chromatic armor_ the wand created for you. The spell ends and light of that color flashes brightly in a 20-foot emanation. Creatures in the area take damage of the type associated with the color you chose, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC; the amount of damage depends on the wand's type. This action has the trait corresponding to the damage type you chose.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _chromatic armor_ of the appropriate level.
