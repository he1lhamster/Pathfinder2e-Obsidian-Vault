_Briar_ was formed ages ago by the Eldest when they tore from Nyrissa's mind and spirit her capability to love, then solidified this emotional energy into a sword. They entrusted _Briar's_ safe keeping to [[DATABASE/deity/The Lantern King|the Lantern King]], who mischievously kept moving the sword from world to world, always near to the regions Nyrissa was focused on but always hidden from her so that he could privately enjoy the delicious irony that the thing she sought so ardently was always kept just out of reach.
 When first recovered by the PCs, _Briar_ is a _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Bastard Sword|bastard sword]]_, but its additional powers remain dormant. These powers can be awakened as the PCs progress through Chapter 10. The process of awakening _Briar_ requires that the weapon be present when [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]] blooms are defeated or when powerful creatures from the First World are slain—_Briar_ need not be the weapon that defeats a bloom or slays a monster, but it must be in the immediate area (within 500 feet). Defeating a bloom or slaying a 17th-level or greater monster from the First World— including all creatures closely associated with a bloom—gives _Briar_ a Sharpness Point. As it accumulates these points, it gains additional powers, as detailed below.
 Once _Briar_ gains the capability to speak, it can relate to its partner the sad tale of its creation, including the fact that it was created by the Lantern King using Nyrissa's capacity to love. _Briar_ knows that without love, Nyrissa is as good as dead, and it suspects that only by being used to slay Nyrissa can it be returned to her soul. It doesn't know about the Lantern King's additional machinations, the nature of the _Apology_, or Nyrissa's reasons for attacking the Stolen Lands, and as such doesn't realize there is another method to be reunited with the nymph queen—see the end of Chapter 10.
 The first time _Briar_ is brought within 30 feet of Nyrissa, it automatically gains enough Sharpness Points to reach 20 points.

**20 Sharpness Points** _Briar_ becomes a _+4 major striking shifting cold iron vorpal bastard sword_. Its statistics improve as follows. 
**Perception** +36, normal vision, darkvision, and hearing within 60 feet 
**Communication** speech and telepathy (Aklo, Common, and Sylvan) 
**Skills** First World Lore +36, Nature +34 
**Int** +6, **Wis** +6, **Cha** +9

**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** _Briar_ casts an 8th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Barkskin|barkskin]] on its partner.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** _Briar_ damages a plant creature; **Effect** _Briar_ draws moisture out of the plant creature's body, dealing 14d10 negative damage (DC 43 basic Fortitude save)
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Frequency** once per month; **Trigger** _Briar's_ partner would die; **Effect** _Briar_ resurrects its partner. The partner returns to life with full Hit Points and the same spells prepared and points in their pools they had when they died, but still suffering from any long-term debilitations of the old body. The target is also permanently changed in some way that shifts their appearance slightly toward that of Nyrissa's, such as a green streak in the hair, a few thorny growths on the body, or a slight greenish cast to their skin.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** _Briar's_ partner Strikes Nyrissa with _Briar_ for the first time in a round; **Effect** Nyrissa must make a successful DC 50 Fortitude save to resist being [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] (stunned 3 on a critical failure). _Briar's_ partner gains a +4 item bonus to all saving throws against Nyrissa's spells for 1 minute.
**Destruction** The Lantern King can will _Briar's_ destruction if he chooses. Alternately, defeating the Lantern King's aspect (see page 600) causes the sword's destruction. Once _Briar_ is destroyed, Nyrissa regains the capability to love once again, but what she does next will depend on how the PCs treated her—assuming she survives.
 If Nyrissa is slain, _Briar_ immediately loses 1d6 Sharpness points. It can never again gain Sharpness points, and it continues to lose more at the rate of 1d6 every 24 hours. Once _Briar's_ Sharpness points drop to 0 in this way, the sword is destroyed.
