_The Survivor_ represents rebirth through ordeal. When you have _The Survivor_ invested, you gain [[DATABASE/feat/Diehard|Diehard]] as a bonus feat. If you already possess this feat, you gain a +2 item bonus to all recovery checks. This item bonus increases to +3 if you are at least 17th-level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** you are reduced to 0 Hit Points; **Effect** You somehow manage to survive what could have been a fatal blow. Instead of being reduced to 0 Hit Points, you drop to 1 Hit Point instead and immediately restore an additional 4d8+16 Hit Points. The amount of Hit Point restored increases to 5d8+20 if you are at least 15th level, 6d8+24 if you're at least 17th level, and 7d8+28 if you're at least 19th level.
