This long, gnarled staff looks like several bones fused together, then wrapped tightly with strips of desiccated, gray skin. At the top of the staff, a clump of sinew clasps a small stone orb resembling a large human eye. When the staff is activated, this eye twitches and glances around randomly. When wielding this staff, you gain a +1 item bonus to visual Perception checks.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.

* **3rd** [[Organsight]], [[Web of Eyes]]
* **4th** [[Clairvoyance]], [[Countless Eyes]], [[Detect Scrying]]
