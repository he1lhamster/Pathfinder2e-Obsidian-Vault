A _drake rifle_ is a firearm made from the saliva glands of a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Drake|drake]]. The firearm launches small bursts of empowered spittle instead of typical rounds of ammunition. A drake rifle is a _+1 weapon_. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d10 damage with a range increment of 150 feet and reload 1. It deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the drake from which it was made. On a critical hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]] of the same type as the weapon equal to 1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice. A drake rifle does not add critical specialization effects.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact (evocation, magical) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You fire a large, specialized burst designed to hamper your foes. Make a ranged Strike with the drake rifle. As long as the Strike isn't a critical failure, the drake rifle deals 1 splash damage per weapon damage die to the target and creatures within 5 feet of the target. This splash damage is of the same type as its normal damage.
 On a hit, the drake rifle provides one of the following additional effects based on its damage type:

* **Acid** Clinging acid makes it painful and sickening to move. The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]].
* **Cold** Frozen spittle clings to the target. The target takes a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute.
* **Electricity** Small bursts of electricity continue to spark and jolt the target. The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] for 1d4 rounds.
* **Fire** A massive explosion knocks the target back. The target is pushed 10 feet away from you, and if it's on the ground, it falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
* **Poison** Noxious vapors fill the target's lungs. The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] for 1 minute.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the saliva glands of a ritually hunted drake with a breath weapon that deals the appropriate damage type for the _drake rifle_.
