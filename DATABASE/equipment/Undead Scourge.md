An undead scourge is a _+1 [[Striking]] [[Disrupting]] [[Dagger]]_ with a bluish-white metal blade that emits a faint glow. These used to be weapons of [[Pharasma]] undead slayers only, but the slayers have since shared these daggers with the Knights of Lastwall.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You damage an undead creature with the _undead scourge_; **Effect** You disrupt the undead's connection to negative energy. For 1 minute, the undead damaged with the dagger can't be healed by negative energy unless the effect attempting to heal the undead first counteracts the _undead scourge's_ effect, with a counteract level of 4 and DC of 25. Positive energy still has the usual effects on the undead.
