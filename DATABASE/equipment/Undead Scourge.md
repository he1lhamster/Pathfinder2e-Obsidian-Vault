An undead scourge is a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|disrupting]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_ with a bluish-white metal blade that emits a faint glow. These used to be weapons of [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasmin]] undead slayers only, but the slayers have since shared these daggers with the Knights of Lastwall.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You damage an undead creature with the _undead scourge_; **Effect** You disrupt the undead's connection to negative energy. For 1 minute, the undead damaged with the dagger can't be healed by negative energy unless the effect attempting to heal the undead first counteracts the _undead scourge's_ effect, with a counteract level of 4 and DC of 25. Positive energy still has the usual effects on the undead.
