The effigy of a Gargantuan tyrannosaurus forms when you open the bottle, causing devastation as it rampages. The tyrannosaurus Strides up to 40 feet. It can move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures and can attempt to [[DATABASE/monsterability/Trample|Trample]] each creature whose space it enters, dealing 2d10+12 bludgeoning damage with a DC 27 basic Reflex save. It can attempt to Trample each creature only once.
