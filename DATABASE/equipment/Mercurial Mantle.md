This deep red cloak fits lightly about your shoulders, and the edges perpetually twitch slightly, as though caught in a breeze. The cloth feels smoother than silk, rippling and swaying like liquid when in motion. You feel a lively energy infusing your arms and legs. You gain a +3 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]], and a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks from reactions triggered by your movement.
 When you invest the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** An enemy misses you with a melee Strike; **Effect** You slip around the attacking creature with ease. You Step, without moving away from the triggering enemy, and then make a melee Strike against the triggering enemy if it's within reach. If you do make a Strike, the target attempts a DC 38 Perception check before you roll.
**Failure** This creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against the Strike.
**Critical Failure** This creature is flat-footed against all your attacks until the end of their next turn.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision (conjuration, teleportation) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The cloak hums with power as your whirl it around yourself, disappearing amid a brief flash of light. Teleport up to double your Speed to a location you can see. At the end of the teleportation, you can make a melee Strike against a creature within reach, if there is one.
