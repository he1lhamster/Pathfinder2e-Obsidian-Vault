Complex and symmetrical, an _axiomatic_ rune imbues a weapon with lawful energy. A weapon with this rune deals an additional 1d6 lawful damage against chaotic targets. If you are chaotic, you are enfeebled 2 while carrying or wielding this weapon. 
When you critically succeed at an attack roll with this weapon against a chaotic creature, instead of rolling, count each weapon damage die as average damage rounded up (3 for d4, 4 for d6, 5 for d8, 6 for d10, 7 for d12).
**Craft Requirements** You are lawful.
