This item looks like a normal javelin carved with lightning-bolt motifs. If thrown without being activated, it wobbles in the air and fails to strike true. When you Activate the javelin, your command makes the carvings crackle with electricity. You then hurl the javelin. It shatters immediately after leaving your hand and unleashes its magic as a 4th-level [[Lightning Bolt]] originating from your space. The bolt deals 5d12 electricity damage and has a Reflex save DC of 25.
