This bullet is crafted entirely from obsidian and engraved with hair-thin runes. When an activated _corpsecaller round_ hits a target, the struck creature is called to the grave. It takes 4d10 negative damage with a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw.
**Critical Success** The foe is unaffected.
**Success** The foe takes half damage.
**Failure** The foe takes full damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]]. If the foe dies within the next 24 hours, its corpse is tethered to the [[DATABASE/plane/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], making it easier to raise as an undead. Creatures using the [[DATABASE/ritual/Create Undead|create undead]] ritual on the foe's corpse receive a +2 circumstance bonus to their primary and secondary skill checks for the ritual.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the foe takes double damage and is doomed 2.
