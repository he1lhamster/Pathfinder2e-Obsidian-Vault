Small scars or marks around your eye improve your distant vision. These scars are especially common among [[DATABASE/ancestry/Orc|orc]] scouts, who favor scars shaped like eagle talons. You can see four times farther than normal. If you have darkvision, you can see blood in color. Higher-level versions of an _eye slash_ are larger and more elaborate scars or marks, radiating out around the eye.
