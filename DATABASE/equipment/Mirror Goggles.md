These goggles feature highly reflective lenses. While wearing the goggles, you gain a +1 item bonus to visual Perception checks and to saving throws against visual effects.

The creature must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save as it becomes disoriented by this reflection. On a failure, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (sickened 2 on a critical failure). The creature is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
