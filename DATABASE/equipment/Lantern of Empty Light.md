It's said that the pale blue light of this eldritch lantern shines from another dimension or even is linked, somehow, to the glow of a ghost when it is consumed by the Outer Goddess [[DATABASE/deity/Nhimbaloth|Nhimbaloth]]. A lantern of empty light is not intrinsically an evil item, though it remains a favored tool of those who would manipulate the minds of others for sinister reasons. It can be used as a normal [[DATABASE/equipment/Lantern|bull's-eye lantern]], but prolonged use tends to instill in the user a vague sense of being watched by unseen eyes.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact (emotion, visual) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You direct the lantern's light upon a single living creature within 60 feet. That creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save to resist the light's effects.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and realizes that you attempted to mentally influence them with the light.
**Success** The creature is unaffected but thinks the light was harmless, unless it knows the true nature of the lantern already.
**Failure** The creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] by the lantern's light, and remains fascinated as long as you Sustain the Activation, up to 10 minutes.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but you can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 hour. When the effect ends, the fascinated creature remembers any events that took place while fascinated only as indistinct, dream-like memories.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You direct the lantern's light upon a single incorporeal undead creature within 60 feet to siphon away some of the creature's essence, dealing 4d8 positive damage to the creature (DC 20 basic Will save).
