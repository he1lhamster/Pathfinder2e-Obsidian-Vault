Stupor poison is a more potent distillation of [[DATABASE/equipment/Lethargy Poison|lethargy poison]]. Further exposure to stupor poison doesn't require the target to attempt additional saving throws; only failing a saving throw against an ongoing exposure can progress its stage.
 **Saving Throw** DC 20 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 hours; **Stage 1** [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] (1 round); **Stage 2** slowed 2 and flat-footed (1 round); **Stage 3** [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] with no Perception check to wake up (1 round); **Stage 4** unconscious with no Perception check to wake up (1d6 hours)
