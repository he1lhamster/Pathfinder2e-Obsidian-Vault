This finely wrought sextant is made from silver with several onyx mirrors and shades made from thin sets of crystal glass. A [[DATABASE/equipment/Spyglass|fine spyglass]] made of silver is affixed to the frame; removing the spyglass destroys the sextant. By all appearances, the sextant shouldn't function, as the shades and mirrors are swapped, but when you look through the spyglass, you see a night sky during the day and the sun during the night, as if day and night were inverted.
 When you use the sextant, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] checks, which increases to a +2 item bonus when you [[DATABASE/action/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]].
