Magical reagents slosh inside this rime-frosted pottery jar the size of a human head. Despite appearing to be rimed in hoarfrost, the jar is warm to the touch. Ilverani wizards create _rime jars_ to sustain themselves during the coldest winter nights.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact ; **Effect** The jar draws off the cold and warms your body. If you have the [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] condition caused by exposure to environmental cold, it removes the condition. For 8 hours after applying the rime, you treat extreme cold as severe cold.
