_Holy_ weapons command powerful celestial energy. A weapon with this rune deals an extra 1d6 good damage against evil targets. If you are evil, you are enfeebled 2 while carrying or wielding this weapon.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You critically succeed at an attack roll against an evil creature with the weapon; **Effect** You regain HP equal to double the evil creature’s level. This is a good, positive, healing effect.
**Craft Requirements** You are good.
