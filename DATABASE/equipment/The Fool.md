_The Fool_ represents grave foolishness, grand naivete, and exceptional greed. As long as you have _The Fool_ invested, anytime you gain the stupefied condition, reduce its value by 1. You also gain a +2 item bonus to all saving throws against effects that cause the [[Stupefied]] condition. This bonus increases to +3 if you're at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact (mental) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You display _The Fool_ to your foes in a clumsy, awkward, and embarrassing way. Choose up to four creatures within 60 feet. These four creatures must attempt a Will save against your class DC.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is distracted by your antics and is stupefied 1 until the start of your next turn.
**Failure** The creature is stupefied 2.
**Critical Failure** The creature is stupefied 3. In addition, for 1 minute, the creature is [[Confused]].
