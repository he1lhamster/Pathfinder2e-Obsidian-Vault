This piece of silver or gold jewelry is adorned with miniature images of kite shields and can be used to fasten a cloak or cape. The brooch automatically absorbs [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Missile|magic missile]] spells targeting you. A _brooch of shielding_ can absorb 30 individual _magic missiles_ before it melts and becomes useless. Sometimes when found, a _brooch of shielding_ has already absorbed a number of missiles.
