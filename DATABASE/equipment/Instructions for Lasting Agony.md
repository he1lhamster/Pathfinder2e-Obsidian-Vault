This worn and stained manual emits a chill when opened.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision (metamagic) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** If your next action is to cast a harmful necromancy spell that you prepared from this grimoire and that allows a saving throw, you warp and twist negative energy into the spell to cause intense pain. If the target fails its saving throw against the spell, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] by the pain.
