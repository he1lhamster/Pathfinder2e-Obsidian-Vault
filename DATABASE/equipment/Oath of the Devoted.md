You gain fire and mental resistance 5. When you die, you rise as an undead creature with the zombie trait on the next round; if you are a PC, you become an NPC under [[Walkena]] control. Your stats remain the same, except that your alignment changes to evil. If you reach 0 Hit Points as a zombie, you are destroyed and do not rise again.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves. Choose a weapon or an unarmed Strike; your chosen attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage for the next 1 minute. 
**Special** If you are a zombie at a time when Mzali is entirely purged of foreigners, your duty is fulfilled and you are immediately destroyed.
