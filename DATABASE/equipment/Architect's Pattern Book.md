Typically created by [[DATABASE/class_/Wizard|wizards]] who are hobbyists or professional architects, an _architect's pattern book_ allows the caster to customize certain spells that create magical structures or domiciles, adding recreational areas such as an indoor bathhouse, gaming room, swimming pool, or similar luxury.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision (metamagic) **Frequency** once per week; **Effect** If your next action is to cast a [[DATABASE/spell/Cozy Cabin|cozy cabin]], [[DATABASE/spell/Magnificent Mansion|magnificent mansion]], or [[DATABASE/spell/Resplendent Mansion|resplendent mansion]] spell, you add a room to the structure that is up to 10 feet per side per level of the spell. This room is outfitted with all the accoutrements for a particular type of recreation, determined by you when you cast the spell. Any character who spends at least 1 hour using this recreational facility and then sleeps a full 8 hours inside the location created by the spell is exceptionally well-rested. They regain double the amount of Hit Points they would normally receive for an 8-hour rest, and when they make the next day's preparations, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks and Will saves for the next 12 hours.
