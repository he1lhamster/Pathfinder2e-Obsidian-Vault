This [[DATABASE/equipment/Astrolabe|astrolabe]] is fashioned of magically attuned platinum plates and rings and is inset with carefully measured ruby gems. The astrolabe's back is engraved with helpful charts, a calendar, and a maker's mark. An _astrolabe of falling stars_ can be used as a mariner's astrolabe. In addition, it can produce the following magical effect.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** With a flick of your finger, you set the astrolabe's rule spinning, causing the inset rubies to become a blur. Choose a point within 100 feet. The _astrolabe of falling stars_ calls down a brief rain of meteorites in a 10-foot burst centered on that point, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning and 1d8 fire damage to creatures in the area (DC 19 basic Reflex save).
