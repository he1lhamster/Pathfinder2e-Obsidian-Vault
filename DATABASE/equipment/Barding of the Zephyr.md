 When your companion falls, wind picks it up from below; it gains the effects of [[Feather Fall]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You trace a finger along the wind motifs on the barding, granting your companion wearing the barding a fly Speed of 30 feet for 10 minutes. Even if the companion doesn’t have the mount special ability, it can still Fly while being ridden.
