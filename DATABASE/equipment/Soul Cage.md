As you [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]] your _soul cage_, you trap your soul within it, an integral part of the complicated process of becoming a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Lich|lich]]. When you're destroyed, your soul flees to the _soul cage_, which rebuilds your undead body over the course of 1d10 days.
 Afterward, you manifest next to the _soul cage_, fully healed and in a new body (lacking any equipment you had on your old body). Only destroying your _soul cage_ can prevent you from returning. You choose the form of your _soul cage_ when you Craft it. A few options include a miniature cage, a ring, an amulet, or a crown. Work with your GM to adjust the usage and Bulk as needed, though a _soul cage_ is rarely more than light Bulk. The _soul cage_ has Hardness 9 and 36 HP.
 If your _soul cage_ is destroyed but you aren't, you can attempt to find your soul and trap it again, building a new _soul cage_. This is no trivial feat and often takes an entire adventure to accomplish. If you don't cage your soul again, you suffer a long decline as described on page 119.
