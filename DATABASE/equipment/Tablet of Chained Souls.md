Half-formed, unreadable runes drift across this weathered stone tablet, which resembles a tombstone too eroded to be legible. Created by a long-dead order of scholars dedicated to [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]], the _tablet of chained souls_ can be a powerful tool in laying uneasy spirits to rest, but its magic exacts a heavy cost.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact ; **Effect** You present the tablet to a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghost|ghost]], or lay it on a haunted site. The tablet's words resolve into a cryptic but accurate clue about the unfinished business that keeps this spirit from rest. Upon reading the tablet's words, you are subject to a [[DATABASE/ritual/Geas|geas]] that requires you to right that wrong and lay the ghost to rest. If you die without completing the task, you become a ghost, cursed to remain until another recovers the tablet and discharges your duty.
