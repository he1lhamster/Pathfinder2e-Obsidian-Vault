This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, embroidered with gold trim and symbols significant in elven culture. The cloak allows you to cast the _[[DATABASE/spell/Ghost Sound|ghost sound]]_ cantrip as an arcane innate spell. When you adjust the cloak’s clasp (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You draw the hood up and gain the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Invisibility|invisibility]], with the spell's normal duration or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first. If you're also wearing _[[DATABASE/equipment/Boots of Elvenkind|boots of elvenkind]]_, you can activate this ability twice per day.
