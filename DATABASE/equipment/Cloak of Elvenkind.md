# Cloak of Elvenkind<span class="item-type">Item 7+</span>

<span class="item-trait">Illusion</span><span class="item-trait">Invested</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Usage** worn cloak; **Bulk** L

---
This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, embroidered with gold trim and symbols significant in elven culture. The cloak allows you to cast the _[[Ghost Sound]]_ cantrip as an arcane innate spell. When you adjust the cloak’s clasp (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You draw the hood up and gain the effects of [[Invisibility]], with the spell's normal duration or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first. If you're also wearing _[[Boots of Elvenkind]]_, you can activate this ability twice per day.
