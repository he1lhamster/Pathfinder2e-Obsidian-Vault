This grimoire fancifully illustrates the spells you inscribe within it with illuminated drawings of creatures that have never existed, the pictures changing to depict new ones from time to time.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision (polymorph, transmutation) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** You're under the effect of a polymorph spell you prepared from this grimoire that offers a choice of multiple forms; **Effect** You transform into a different form allowed by the polymorph by bending and molding the spell's energy. This reduces the spell's remaining duration by half.
