This _+1 [[Striking]] [[Arquebus]]_ is used by caravan guards to nonlethally—though powerfully—deter large game and bandits. When fired, the spark gun deals mental damage and adds the nonlethal trait to the attack. Each _mindlance_ also includes a [[Reinforced Stock]] that benefits from any fundamental runes on the firearm. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a _mindlance_, the target becomes [[Frightened]] unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Will save.
