This _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Arquebus|arquebus]]_ is used by caravan guards to nonlethally—though powerfully—deter large game and bandits. When fired, the spark gun deals mental damage and adds the nonlethal trait to the attack. Each _mindlance_ also includes a [[DATABASE/weapon/Reinforced Stock|reinforced stock]] that benefits from any fundamental runes on the firearm. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a _mindlance_, the target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 2]] unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Will save.
