_Cayden's brew_ is like rich beer or ale, with a golden-brown color and foamy head. For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +1 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 15-foot cone of intoxicating vapor with a burp that can be heard for 100 feet. Any creature in the vapor must attempt a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw. After you use this breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature is clumsy 1 and stupefied 1 for 1d4 rounds.
**Critical Failure** The creature becomes clumsy 2, stupefied 2, and [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. The clumsy and stupefied conditions last until 1d4 rounds after the sickened condition ends.
