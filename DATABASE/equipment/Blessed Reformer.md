The [[Celestial]] word for “repent” is etched in golden lettering on the shaft of this _+2 [[Striking]] [[Merciful]] [[Mithral Weapon]] [[Warhammer]]_. An evil-aligned creature is [[Enfeebled]] when carrying or wielding this weapon.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You hold your weapon aloft, calling on righteousness to steel your resolve. You cast [[Protection]] on yourself and you must select evil as the chosen alignment.
 **Redeemer Wielder** If you're a [[Champion]] of the [[Redeemer]] cause, you also gain the following two benefits.

* When you critically hit an evil creature with the _blessed reformer_, until the end of your next turn, the target takes a –10-foot penalty to its Speeds and can't Step.
* You can Activate the weapon in the following way.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** You hit a creature using the _blessed reformer_ as your last action; **Effect** You cast [[Calm Emotions]] at the same level as your champion focus spells. It must target the creature you hit, and the creature takes a status penalty on its save against the spell equal to the _blessed reformer's_ number of weapon damage dice.
**Craft Requirements** You're a champion with the redeemer cause. The initial materials must include 140 gp of [[Mithral]].
