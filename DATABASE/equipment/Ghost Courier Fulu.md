The inscription on a _ghost courier fulu_ leaves space for a message, and a prominent red stamp indicates which [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Delivery Fulu|ghost delivery fulu]] this fulu homes in on. When you Activate this fulu, you dictate a message up to 25 words long that then magically appears on the paper in the language you spoke. The fulu then disappears into the [[DATABASE/plane/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]], arriving at the assigned _ghost delivery fulu_ in 2d10 hours, provided that fulu is within 500 miles. There, the fulu's magic dissipates, but the message remains. If the fulu takes any damage in transit, it has a 50% chance to drop back into the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], intact but bereft of magic.
