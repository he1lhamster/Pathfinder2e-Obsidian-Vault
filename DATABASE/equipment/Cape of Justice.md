While [[Yaezhing]] is feared and seldom worshipped in the open, some regions of Tian Xia see him as a god of necessary evil and their only hope for justice. This garment is often worn by bounty hunters or priests of Yaezhing, yet non-worshippers of the god of harsh justice sometimes wear this item without fear of religious persecution. The red cape appears almost black while in the shadows, with a lighter red mandala pattern on it that resembles a shuriken.
 When you invest a _cape of justice_, you must designate a single creature as your offender. You must have met the creature before, or the creature should have a persona well known to the public (for instance, a bandit's epithet, if not their face as shown on a wanted poster).
 You gain a +1 item bonus to [[Demoralize]] this creature. If you don't designate a creature as your offender when you invest the _cape of justice_, or if 24 hours pass without you either slaying or capturing your offender, your thoughts become worried and distracted and you take a –1 item penalty to Perception checks for the next 24 hours.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact (force) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** By using a free hand to grab the edge of your cape and give it a quick flourish, you cause a red, shuriken-shaped bolt of force to fire at a target within 60 feet that you can see. The shuriken hits automatically and deals 1d4+1 force damage, or 2d4+2 force damage if the target is your designated offender. If the target is within 30 feet, you can attempt to Demoralize the target as a free action after the shuriken strikes them.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact (incapacitation) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You produce [[Manacles]] from the cape and then fling them at a Medium or Small bipedal target within 30 feet. The target must attempt a DC 18 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected, and the manacles vanish.
**Success** The manacles strike the target's legs but fail to latch properly. The target is [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of your next turn, at which point the manacles vanish.
**Failure** The manacles lock on the target's legs, causing the target to take a –15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute, or until it [[Escape]] or is freed by someone using [[Pick a Lock]] (DC 18), after which the manacles vanish.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [[Immobilized]] for as long as the manacles remain in place.
