Spellcasting services, listed on Table 6–15, are uncommon. Having a spell cast for you requires finding a spellcaster who knows and is willing to cast it. It’s hard to find someone who can cast higher-level spells, and uncommon spells typically cost at least 100% more, if you can find someone who knows them at all. Spells that take a long time to cast (over 1 minute) usually cost 25% more. You must pay any cost listed in the spell in addition to the Price on the table.
