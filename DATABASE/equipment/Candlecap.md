The crown of a _candlecap_ is stitched leather sewn in the shape of a small bowl. Fixed inside the bowl is a melted nub of wax with a small black wick.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You shake your head, and the candle wick ignites. The _candlecap_ sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. The candle doesn't require oxygen and can't be smothered or quenched. Activating the _candlecap_ again douses the light.
