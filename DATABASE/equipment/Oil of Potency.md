When you apply this thick, viscous oil to a weapon or suit of armor, that item immediately becomes magically potent. If the item is a weapon, it temporarily becomes a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] weapon_, or, if it's armor, it temporarily becomes _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Resilient|resilient]] armor_. This lasts for 1 minute.
