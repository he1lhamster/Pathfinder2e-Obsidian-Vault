This charred and blackened _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/feat/Clan Pistol|clan pistol]]_ is coated in a thick layer of soot and grease and its retort sounds uncomfortably like a scream. Clearly at dangerous risk of misfire, this weapon claimed the life of its dwarven crafter shortly after completion and is haunted by that pained spirit. This ever-burning spirit keeps the firearm warm to the touch, regardless of surrounding environment.
 No matter how much you clean and maintain it, an _immolation clan pistol_ is always at risk of a misfire, and the flat check to avoid a misfire is DC 7 rather than DC 5. On a misfire, an _immolation hand cannon_ releases a blast of concentrated fire, dealing you 2d6 fire damage and 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]].
 An _immolation clan pistol_ fuses with you when you first fire it. While you're fused with the _immolation clan pistol_, the pained spirit haunts your dreams, forcing you to relive its death each night. If you fired the _immolation clan pistol_ that day, you are unharmed by these dreams. If you didn't fire the _immolation clan pistol_ that day, but still possess it, you awaken fatigued. If you no longer possess the _immolation clan pistol_, the spirit of its dwarven smith is enraged by your neglect; you awaken fatigued and aflame, taking 2d6 persistent fire damage.
 Regardless, these nightmares possess clues to the spirit's life. If you take the _immolation hand cannon_ to the site of its creation and repair it with tools belonging to the tormented spirit, you might be able to break the curse. If the spirit is set free, this weapon becomes a _+2 greater striking [[DATABASE/equipment/Flaming|flaming]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Hand Cannon|hand cannon]]_ with no other abilities or curses.
**Activate** command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You allow yourself to become partially possessed by the immolated spirit bound to the hand cannon. For 1 minute, you look like a flaming corpse. During this time, you gain a +2 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks and the immolation hand cannon becomes a _+2 striking flaming hand cannon_.
