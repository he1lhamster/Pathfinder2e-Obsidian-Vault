Made of shiny brown leather, this _+1 striking [[Sling]]_ has a single white thread interwoven into its cord.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact (sonic) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You pull the white thread free, then whirl the sling in circles at high speed. It lets out an ear-piercing wave of sound. Each creature in a 30-foot cone takes 4d6 sonic damage (DC 21 basic Fortitude save). Any creature that fails is [[Deafened]] for 1 round, or 1 hour on a critical failure.
