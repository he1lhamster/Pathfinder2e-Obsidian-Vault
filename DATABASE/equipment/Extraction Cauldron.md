This large magical stew pot can boil objects down to their valuable components, greatly assisting anyone who wants to harvest raw materials without visiting a settlement. The cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact **Requirements** The cauldron must be filled with boiling water for at least 1 hour; **Effect** As you stir the cauldron, one object that has been in it for at least an hour transforms into raw materials with a value of one half the object's Price; art objects are instead transformed into raw materials with a value equal to their Price. The cauldron produces raw materials associated with the object but unaffected by immersion in boiling water. For example, a magical broom might be rendered into a block of dense, valuable wood, while a gilt-edged portrait might be transformed into a lump of gold. Objects removed from the cauldron before an hour passes can't be transformed and they might be damaged or ruined by water and heat.
