This sandy-textured robe comes with sleeves that resemble dorsal fins. It's believed to have been developed by frustrated alchemists from the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Universe]] for trips to the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]]. The sharkskin robe grants you a swim Speed equal to your land Speed and a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks.
