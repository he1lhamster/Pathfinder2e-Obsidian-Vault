A galvanic chew is a processed ball of dried [[DATABASE/monster/Electric Eel|electric eel]], roasted until chewy and coated in spicy, reagent-infused powder that tingles with electricity as you chew. For up to 1 hour, you have resistance 5 to electricity.
 **Secondary Effect** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (electricity) **Trigger** You're hit by a melee attack or touched by a creature; **Effect** You channel electricity into the triggering creature, which must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] (or stunned 2 on a critical failure). The chew becomes inert. You're then temporarily immune to galvanic chews for 24 hours or until the next time you make your daily preparations.
