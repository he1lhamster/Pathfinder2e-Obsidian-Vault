This supple, light wooden wand drifts to the ground like a feather or leaf when dropped, landing unharmed. A thin coil of metal wraps around the wand's handle.
**Activate** Cast a Spell **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Jump|jump]], but can jump up to 60 feet. When you land you shatter the ground, making each creature in a 5-foot emanation [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of its next turn. In addition, the space you land in and all squares in the emanation become difficult terrain for 1 minute.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of 1st-level _jump_.
