This golden ring has three diamonds set into its face.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** You are targeted by a spell; **Effect** The ring replicates the effects of an 8th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Spell Turning|spell turning]] with a counteract modifier of +35, possibly causing the triggering spell to reflect back on its caster. The ring can reflect no more than 9 total levels of spells per day. If you activate the ring to reflect a spell that would exceed this limit, the attempt fails, but the attempted usage of the ring does not count toward the daily limit.
