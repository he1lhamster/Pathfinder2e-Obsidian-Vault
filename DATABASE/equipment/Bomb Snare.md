You create a snare that catalyzes three 3rd-level moderate alchemical bombs of the same type to explode when a creature enters the snare’s square. The target and all creatures in adjacent squares must attempt a DC 26 Reflex save, as the snare deals damage equal to three times the direct hit damage from one of the component bombs (for example, 6d6 electricity damage from [[DATABASE/equipment/Bottled Lightning|bottled lightning]]) with no splash damage or other effects. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage and no other effects.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage. It also takes all other effects of a direct hit from one of the component bombs (such as flat-footed from bottled lightning or persistent damage from an [[DATABASE/equipment/Acid Flask|acid flask]]).
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, plus all other effects of a direct hit (as failure).
**Craft Requirements** Supply three of the same damaging 3rd-level moderate alchemical bomb.
