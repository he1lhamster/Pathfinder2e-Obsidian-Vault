This gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws.
Each _heartstone_ is powered by the spirit of a specific night hag. If it’s separated from her for 24 hours (or she’s been dead for 24 hours), it becomes a nonmagical gemstone. A _heartstone_ allows the hag to use additional occult innate spells: _[[Ethereal Jaunt]]_ (9th level) and _[[Bind Soul]]_ at will, and _[[Shadow Blast]]_ twice per day.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Requirements** You must be touching the _heartstone_.; **Effect** The _heartstone_ attempts to counteract one disease affecting you (counteract level 5, counteract modifier +18).
**Craft Requirements** You must be a night hag.

**Price** 2,500 gp ((1,000 gp when nonmagical))
This pale gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws and the ability to discern a target's alignment (as [[Detect Alignment]], but can detect chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras simultaneously) at will by peering through the gemstone.
 Like all hag _heartstones_, this gemstone is powered by [[Skarja]] spirit. Skarja does not need to wear her _heartstone_ to benefit from its powers, but she cannot use them if she hasn't touched her _heartstone_ in the past 7 days. If Skarja's _heartstone_ is separated from her for more than 7 days (or if she's been dead for 7 days), it becomes a non-magical gemstone. Skarja's _heartstone_ allows her to use additional occult innate spells: [[Ethereal Jaunt]] (9th level) and [[Bind Soul]] at will, [[Shadow Blast]] (6th level) twice per day, and [[Spirit Blast]] once per day.
