This gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws.
Each _heartstone_ is powered by the spirit of a specific night hag. If it’s separated from her for 24 hours (or she’s been dead for 24 hours), it becomes a nonmagical gemstone. A _heartstone_ allows the hag to use additional occult innate spells: _[[DATABASE/spell/Ethereal Jaunt|ethereal jaunt]]_ (9th level) and _[[DATABASE/spell/Bind Soul|bind soul]]_ at will, and _[[DATABASE/spell/Shadow Blast|shadow blast]]_ twice per day.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command **Requirements** You must be touching the _heartstone_.; **Effect** The _heartstone_ attempts to counteract one disease affecting you (counteract level 5, counteract modifier +18).
**Craft Requirements** You must be a night hag.

This pale gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws and the ability to discern a target's alignment (as [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Alignment|detect alignment]], but can detect chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras simultaneously) at will by peering through the gemstone.
 Like all hag _heartstones_, this gemstone is powered by [[DATABASE/monster/Skarja|Skarja's]] spirit. Skarja does not need to wear her _heartstone_ to benefit from its powers, but she cannot use them if she hasn't touched her _heartstone_ in the past 7 days. If Skarja's _heartstone_ is separated from her for more than 7 days (or if she's been dead for 7 days), it becomes a non-magical gemstone. Skarja's _heartstone_ allows her to use additional occult innate spells: [[DATABASE/spell/Ethereal Jaunt|ethereal jaunt]] (9th level) and [[DATABASE/spell/Bind Soul|bind soul]] at will, [[DATABASE/spell/Shadow Blast|shadow blast]] (6th level) twice per day, and [[DATABASE/spell/Spirit Blast|spirit blast]] once per day.
