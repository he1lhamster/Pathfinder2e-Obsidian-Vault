This kit can be used to clean and polish armor. Creatures wearing armor that has been maintained by this kit gain a +1 circumstance bonus on [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on soldiers, guards, [[DATABASE/deity/Gorum|Gorumites]], and other martially minded characters. This bonus expires after 24 hours, or if the armor is soiled in some way, such as by walking through a sewer or falling in a mud pit.
