This ammunition bears a rune with three lines radiating out, each ending in a circle. When an activated bola shot hits a target, it deals nonlethal bludgeoning damage. Compare the attack roll to the target's Reflex DC to determine the shot's other effects.
**Critical Success** The target falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
**Success** The target falls prone.
**Failure** No additional effect.
