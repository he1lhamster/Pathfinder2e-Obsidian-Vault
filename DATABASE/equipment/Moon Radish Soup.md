In addition to its slightly spicy-sweet flavor, Svetlana Leveton's creamy moon radish soup is amazingly comforting, clearing the mind of anyone who has a bowl of it. After you eat the soup, it attempts to counteract (counteract +6) [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] conditions affecting you; if successful, it reduces the value of your stupefied condition by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success). After eating a serving of moon radish soup, you gain temporary immunity to its effects for 24 hours.
