This staff of magically hardened wood is topped with a silver sculpture depicting magical runic symbols. When used as a weapon, a staff of power is a +2 greater striking staff.
 Voluntarily destroying a staff of power unleashes an incredible blast of energy. When wielding the staff, you can Interact to break it. This releases a 30-foot-burst magical explosion centered on the staff. This deals 2d8 force damage per charge remaining in the staff (DC 40 basic Reflex save). You automatically critically fail your save. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly; this is a death effect.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
