If fried, a [[DATABASE/monster/Bulette|bulette's]] thick forefoot scales render into crunchy snacks. Alchemists add reagents to the frying oil to enhance the scales' properties and flavor. For 1 minute after eating a delve scale, you gain a burrow Speed of 15 feet and a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[DATABASE/action/Long Jump|Long Jump]].
