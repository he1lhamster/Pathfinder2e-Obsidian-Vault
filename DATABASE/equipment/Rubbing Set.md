By using a rubbing set, you can quickly make a copy of carvings or etchings you find during your explorations, making them easier to accurately reproduce. This kit consists of a roll of thin onion-skin paper in a waterproof leather case, several thick wax crayons, and a bar of sealing wax that can be melted and used to temporarily hold the paper in place while you take the rubbing. Using the kit consumes the materials and provides a +1 item bonus on checks to document or reproduce artwork or writing that has been carved, etched, or otherwise physically added to a surface.
