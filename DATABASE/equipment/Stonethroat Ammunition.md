Each piece of _stonethroat ammunition_ is tipped with an unusual yellow stone. When an activated piece of _stonethroat ammunition_ hits a target, the target must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The ammunition lodges itself loosely into the target's throat. For 1 round, the target takes a –2 status penalty to attack rolls with its jaws or fangs, and to [[Athletics]] checks.
**Failure** The ammunition embeds itself deep in the target's throat. The target can't use its jaws or fangs Strike (if it has one) or the [[Swallow Whole]] ability until the end of its next turn.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is [[Enfeebled]] for 1 round.
