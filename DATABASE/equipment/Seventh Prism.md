Beloved by the church of the [[DATABASE/deity/Sivanah|Seventh Veil]], a _seventh prism_ is a crystal that disperses its internal light, casting an aurora of color. If you use a _seventh prism_ to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Color Spray|color spray]], targets are [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for twice as long as their saving throw indicates. On a critical failure, the target is dazzled for 1 minute after its [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] condition ends. Motes of shifting rainbow hues cloud the eyes, making it difficult to see details.
