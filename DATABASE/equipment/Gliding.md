The armor allows you to make a controlled descent.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command ; **Effect** You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. Provided you spend at least 1 action gliding on your turn and haven't yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn. Otherwise, you fall.
