This _+2 [[Holy]] greater striking [[Glaive]]_ has a long, multi-tailed rainbow-colored banner affixed to the butt of the pole in the style of [[Shelyn]] religious symbol. While wielding the glaive, you gain a +2 item bonus on [[Crafting]] and [[Performance]] checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You furl one of the colored tails around the pole, causing the glaive to gain the effects of your choice of the [[Corrosive]], [[Flaming]], [[Frost]], [[Shock]], or [[Thundering]] property runes for 1 round, depending on the tail you chose.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You thrust the blade of the glaive into the ground, activating the power of the banner. (The blade can penetrate any non-metallic surface when used in this way, and does not leave a mark when withdrawn.) As long as the glaive is thrust into the ground and standing upright, all allies within 60 feet who can see the glaive’s banner gain a +2 item bonus to Performance checks.
