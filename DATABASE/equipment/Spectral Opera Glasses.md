These bulky opera glasses are attached to a rod for ease of use. When held up to the eyes, which requires a free hand, you can see up to four times further than normal, and the glasses provide you a +2 item bonus to Perception checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** For 1 hour, anyone who looks through the glasses can see [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] creatures and objects, and sees creatures with the spirit trait as solid and substantial (rather than ghostly).
