While this sinister-looking weapon isn't inherently evil, its unsettling appearance and powers particularly appeal to those who revel in causing pain. A _grisly scythe_ has a twisted thorny haft and a blade that appears to be rusted, but it functions as a _+1 [[Striking]] [[Wounding]] [[Scythe]]_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** Your attack roll with the _grisly scythe_ is a critical success; **Effect** Instead of inflicting slashing damage with the grisly scythe, you inflict negative damage. You regain a number of hit points equal to half the negative damage inflicted, and the creature struck becomes [[Sickened]] from the agony.
