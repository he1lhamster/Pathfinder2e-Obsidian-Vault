A _ghast stiletto_ is a _+1 [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]]_ wrapped in the still-undead skin of a [[DATABASE/monster/Ghast|ghast]]. While you wield the dagger, you gain a +1 status bonus to all saves against [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralysis]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command, Interact (divine, necromancy, olfactory) **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The _ghast stiletto_ afflicts the next living target struck by the dagger with a terrible wound that emits the foul stench of the grave. For the next minute, the target creature, as well as any creatures within a 10-foot emanation, must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (plus [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the emanation, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include skin from a ghast.
