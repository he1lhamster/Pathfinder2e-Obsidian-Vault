This black cooking pot can produce a feast fit for undead.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Interact **Trigger** once per day; **Requirements** The cauldron must be filled with water, herbs, bones, and raw meat, and kept at a boil for 1 hour; **Effect** As you stir the cauldron, its contents transform into 10 meals suitable for undead consumption. Each meal must be ladled from the cauldron individually as a 3-action activity and must be eaten within 1 hour of removal. An undead creature that consumes a meal from the cauldron regains 5d8 Hit Points and gains the benefits of 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Restoration|restoration]] that you choose; living creatures who consume a meal from the cauldron take 5d8 negative damage (DC 27 basic Fortitude save) instead. Any meals remaining in the cauldron 24 hours after activation become inedible slurry.
