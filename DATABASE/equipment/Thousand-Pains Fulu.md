Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a thousand-pains fulu blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a basic Fortitude save against damage determined by the fulu's type. Failure or critical failure primes the target for [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]] triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.

## Thousand-Pains Fulu (Burl)<span class="item-type">Item 17</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 2,700 gp
Though this green fulu looks inviting, it has a foreboding aura. The DC is 35, and the fulu deals 10d8 poison damage, causing the target's body to respond adversely to their ki. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes fire damage, it takes 2d8 persistent poison damage as well. These effects have the poison trait.

## Thousand-Pains Fulu (Blade)<span class="item-type">Item 8</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 90 gp
This red fulu feels rigid, its edges sharp, and looking at it makes you feel feverish. The DC is 23, and the fulu deals 5d6 slashing damage as meridians burst and cut through flesh. On a failure or critical failure, if the target fails to take an action with the manipulate or move trait on each of its turns, it takes 1d6 persistent slashing damage.

## Thousand-Pains Fulu (Icicle)<span class="item-type">Item 14</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 630 gp
Looking at this black fulu leaves you queasy and cold. The DC is 30, and the fulu deals 10d6 cold damage as the target's ki warps and drains. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes damage from a poison or disease effect or becomes sickened, it takes 2d6 persistent cold damage. These effects have the cold trait.

## Thousand-Pains Fulu (Needle)<span class="item-type">Item 11</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 270 gp
Picking up this white fulu feels like you've stabbed your hand with a pin. The DC is 27, and the fulu deals 7d6 piercing damage as hair, nails, and connective tissues stab inward. On a failure or critical failure, if the target then takes an action with the move trait, it takes 2d6 persistent piercing damage.

## Thousand-Pains Fulu (Stone)<span class="item-type">Item 5</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 30 gp
This fulu's yellow parchment feels dusty and stiff. The DC is 19, and the fulu deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage as muscles swell to crush joints and bones. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes electricity damage, it takes 1d6 persistent bludgeoning damage as well.

## Thousand-Pains Fulu (Void)<span class="item-type">Item 20</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 8,100 gp
The black dot at the center of this purple fulu draws in energy like a bottomless hole. The DC is 38, and the fulu deals 12d10 negative damage by dissipating the target's ki. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes any other damage within 1 minute, it takes 2d10 persistent negative damage as well. These effects have the death and negative traits. Each time the target takes this persistent damage, any creature within 30 feet of it can use a reaction to gain temporary Hit Points equal to the persistent damage taken, distributing the available temporary Hit Points among those that take the reaction. If the creature that affixed the fulu is within 30 feet, it instead gains all the available temporary Hit Points, if it wishes. These temporary Hit Points disappear after 1 minute.
