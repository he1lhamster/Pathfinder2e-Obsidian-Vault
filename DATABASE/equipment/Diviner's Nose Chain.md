The diviner's nose chain is worn by attaching piercings to the ear and nose, creating a connection between the senses of hearing and smell. The diviner's nose chain grants you scent out to 30 feet as an imprecise sense, and a +1 item bonus to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] or [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]].
