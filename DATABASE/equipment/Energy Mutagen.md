When created, this mutagen is attuned to your choice of one of four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. When consumed, the mutagen suffuses your body with energy that spills out of you whenever you attack. At higher levels, it can even grant you the ability to unleash the energy in controlled bursts. 
**Benefit** You gain resistance to the attuned energy type. Whenever you score a hit with a melee weapon, add the listed amount of damage of the attuned energy type. 
**Drawback** You gain weakness 5 to the other three energy types.
