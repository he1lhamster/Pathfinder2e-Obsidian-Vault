Small flecks of mica, sand, and ground glass are packed into a spring-loaded canister that can be rigged to a trip wire or hidden in a container. The first creature to enter the square or open the container must attempt a DC 20 Reflex save as the area is showered with bright, glittering dust that sticks to skin, fur, and clothing.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes a –1 status penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks for 1 minute or until it uses an Interact action to remove the glitter.
**Failure** The creature takes a –2 status penalty to Stealth checks for 2 minutes or until it spends a 2-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove the glitter. If the creature was [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], the glitter outlines it for 1 round, making it [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] rather than [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] to visual senses.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty is –4. The glitter sticks for 5 minutes or until the creature spends a 3-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove it. The glitter continues to fall around the creature until completely removed, leaving a trail behind it as it moves and revealing its rough location; the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]], rather than undetected, to any creature that can see the glitter whenever it would otherwise have been undetected.
