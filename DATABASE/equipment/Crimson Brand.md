These ominous swords are decorated with crimson lacquer and serve as perfect conduits for the Crimson Oath’s power. The first was granted to Clarethe Iomedar by a mysterious patron who many Reclaimers believe to be an emissary of [[DATABASE/deity/Ragathiel|Ragathiel]]. A _crimson brand_ is a _+1 striking [[DATABASE/equipment/Wounding|wounding]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Bastard Sword|bastard sword]]_. When the wielder uses the crimson brand to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Invoke the Crimson Oath|invoke the Crimson Oath]], they can generate a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone instead of the normal 20-foot cone. Whenever the wielder would inflict [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] on an undead creature with the _crimson brand_, they can instead wreathe the creature in ruby energy, inflicting the same amount of persistent positive damage instead of persistent bleed damage.
