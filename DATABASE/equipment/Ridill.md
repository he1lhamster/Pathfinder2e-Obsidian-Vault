This 12-foot sword was made by a [[Cyclops]] in the ancient past. It might be the greatest dragon-killing weapon ever made, and [[Fafnheir]] justly fears it, which is why he keeps it hidden in his hoard. Runes of dragon slaying are written down its blade. _Ridill_ is a _+3 [[Striking]] [[Bane]] [[Speed]] [[Adamantine Weapon]] [[Greatsword]]_. While wielding _Ridill_, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against [[Fear]]. This increases to +4 if the effect is from a dragon. If you have an ability that depends on Large weapons (such as [[Giant Instinct]]), it works with _Ridill_.
 _Ridill_ is always considered to have the appropriate material or damage type necessary to deactivate a dragon's [[Regeneration]] or cause the dragon's weakness to apply. For example, _Ridill_ is considered to be [[Cold Iron Weapon]] when attacking a [[Linnorm]], while it would be treated as having dealt cold damage when attacking a [[Dragon, Red]]. If the dragon has more than one weakness, only the highest value applies.
**Destruction** If you boil _Ridill_ in the blood of 10 different types of dragon ([[Dragon, Blue]] dragon, red dragon, etc.) and drop the eye of a cyclops seer into the brew, _Ridill_ melts away into nothingness.
