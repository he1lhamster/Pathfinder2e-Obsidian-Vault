This 12-foot sword was made by a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Cyclops|cyclops]] in the ancient past. It might be the greatest dragon-killing weapon ever made, and [[DATABASE/monster/Fafnheir|Fafnheir]] justly fears it, which is why he keeps it hidden in his hoard. Runes of dragon slaying are written down its blade. _Ridill_ is a _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|major striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Bane|dragon bane]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Speed|speed]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Weapon|adamantine]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Greatsword|greatsword]]_. While wielding _Ridill_, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against [[DATABASE/spell/Fear|fear]]. This increases to +4 if the effect is from a dragon. If you have an ability that depends on Large weapons (such as [[DATABASE/barbarianinstinct/Giant Instinct|barbarian giant instinct]]), it works with _Ridill_.
 _Ridill_ is always considered to have the appropriate material or damage type necessary to deactivate a dragon's [[DATABASE/monsterability/Regeneration|regeneration]] or cause the dragon's weakness to apply. For example, _Ridill_ is considered to be [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]] when attacking a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Linnorm|linnorm]], while it would be treated as having dealt cold damage when attacking a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Red|red dragon]]. If the dragon has more than one weakness, only the highest value applies.
**Destruction** If you boil _Ridill_ in the blood of 10 different types of dragon ([[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Blue|blue dragon]] dragon, red dragon, etc.) and drop the eye of a cyclops seer into the brew, _Ridill_ melts away into nothingness.
