A _Pathfinder's mentor_ is a [[Wayfinder]] that has developed sapience. Most _Pathfinder's mentors_ are eager explorers that object to staying in one location for long, urging their bearers toward ancient ruins to explore, relics to study, and discoveries to make. To this end, the wayfinder acts as a guide, making Survival checks on your behalf during your travels. A _Pathfinder's mentor_ also has the following activations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision ; **Effect** The wayfinder casts [[Know Direction]] on you.
**Activate** 1 minute (command, envision, Interact) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The wayfinder casts [[Wanderer's Guide]] on you.
