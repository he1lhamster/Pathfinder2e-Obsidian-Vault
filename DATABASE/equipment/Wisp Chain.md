This _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Resilient|resilient]] [[DATABASE/armor/Chain Shirt|chain shirt]]_ is made of small, interlocking currents of wind carefully woven together. While the links of air don't jingle against each other like chain links might, the tiny cyclones nevertheless create a blustering howl akin to standing at the center of a storm. A creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. On a failure, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] until it moves away from you.
**Activate****—Slicing Links** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate); **Effect** You unbind the currents that form your armor and release them as cutting whorls of air that slice into creatures in a 60-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 6d6 slashing damage with a DC 25 basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails its save is also pushed 10 feet (or 20 feet on a critical failure). You lose the AC bonus of your armor until the end of your turn, when the air currents reform the wisp chain around you.
