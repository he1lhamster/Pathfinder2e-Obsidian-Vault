This talisman, a bright red coil that's warm to the touch and faintly resembles a serpent, wraps entirely around your weapon. When you activate this talisman's effect, attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] the creature you hit. On a success, rather than the normal Grapple effects, the coil instead wraps itself around the target with one end remaining attached to your weapon. Your opponent must succeed at a DC 20 [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] check to break free. The coil breaks if you move any further away from the bound opponent, but not if you move any closer.
