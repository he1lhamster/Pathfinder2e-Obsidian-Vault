Khismar developed this unique atomizer that allows for the distribution of elixirs, oils, and potions as a fine spray or mist. The atomizer can hold a single elixir, oil, or potion. An atomizer contains enough reagents to use it up to 10 times before the reagents must be replaced. A new batch of reagents costs 5 gp and requires an Interact action to replace.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact ; **Effect** You spray the contents of the atomizer on yourself or an adjacent willing ally or unattended object. The target gains the effects of the applied elixir, oil, or potion. The target must be a valid target for the effect, such as food or drink for a [[DATABASE/equipment/Nectar of Purification|nectar of purification]], or the consumable is lost.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact ; **Effect** You cause the atomizer to mix its reagents and fire its held consumable at a square within 30 feet. The consumable forms a cloud that fills the space. The first willing valid target to enter the space automatically gains the effect of the consumable. If there are multiple valid targets, such as with multiple weapons for [[DATABASE/equipment/Aligned Oil|aligned oil]], the creature entering the space determines how the effect is applied. The cloud is consumed upon contact with a willing valid target or at the start of your next turn, whichever comes first.
