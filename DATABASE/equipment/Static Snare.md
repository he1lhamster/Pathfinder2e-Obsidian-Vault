You hide insulating crystals or other material that releases a strong static charge when the first creature enters the snare's square. That creature must attempt a DC 18 Reflex saving throw.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The target takes 1 [[Persistent Damage]] and takes a –1 circumstance penalty to saving throws against electricity effects for as long as the persistent electricity damage lasts.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target attracts nearby dirt and dust. If the target is or becomes [[Invisible]], it's merely [[Hidden]] to creatures that have sight as a precise sense. This effect lasts as long as the persistent electricity damage does.
