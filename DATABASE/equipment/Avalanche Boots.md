While the insides of these boots are comfortable, fur-lined leather, the outsides are a jumble of slate plates, giving the impression of a rockslide. You gain a +3 item bonus to [[Athletics]] checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Force Open]] and [[Shove]]. When you invest the boots, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You succeed or critically succeed with a Shove; **Effect** If the Shove was a success, you push your opponent up to 10 feet instead of 5 feet. If the Shove was a critical success, you push your opponent up to 20 feet, and you can then choose to knock them [[Prone]].
