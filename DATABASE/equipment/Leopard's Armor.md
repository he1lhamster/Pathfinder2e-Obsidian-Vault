Made of cobalt-colored steel rings that flow down the entire length of the garment, this _+1 [[Resilient]] [[Chain Mail]]_ includes an armored face covering. The armor is said to be based on the same armor once worn by Azure Leopard, one of Old-Mage Jatembe's magic warriors.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You call upon the ferocity and grace of the leopard. The armor's rings flatten out to become a solid piece of flexible armor. You gain a +2 item bonus to [[Stealth]] checks and [[Intimidation]] checks to [[Demoralize]], but take a –2 penalty to [[Diplomacy]] and [[Society]] checks. This lasts for 1 hour, but you can Activate the armor again to revert it back to its original form.
