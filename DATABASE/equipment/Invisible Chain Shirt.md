This _+2 [[Resilient]] [[Invisibility]] [[Chain Shirt]]_ is itself invisible. Other creatures can't see it at all, allowing you to wear it surreptitiously. Additionally, the armor's invisible composition is quieter and more comfortable than a normal chain shirt. It loses the noisy trait and gains the comfort trait.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You Stride and turn partially invisible, becoming [[Concealed]] until the end of your next turn or until you use a hostile action, whichever comes first. As normal, you can use the concealment from this activation to [[Hide]].
