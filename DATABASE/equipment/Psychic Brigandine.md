Transparent crystals as hard as steel take the place of metal plates on this suit of _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Invisibility|greater invisibility]] [[DATABASE/armor/Splint Mail|splint mail]]_. Also known as a coat of a thousand thoughts in Vudra and Jalmeray, where it was first developed by psychic warriors, it makes your mind an indomitable fortress. You gain resistance 5 to mental damage.
 Whenever you use the armor to become [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], you also become psychically invisible. Each time you would be affected by an effect with the mental trait while you are invisible, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, it doesn't affect you.
