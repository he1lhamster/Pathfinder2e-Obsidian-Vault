The legendary blade _Serithtial_ is said to have been forged by [[DATABASE/deity/Iomedae|Iomedae]], goddess of honor, justice, and valor. She is an intelligent _+4 major striking [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy|holy]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Bastard Sword|bastard sword]]_. Although the sword is made of steel, Serithtial is also treated as [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]] and [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|silver]], allowing her to deal more damage to certain supernatural creatures. She glows as bright as a torch, but you or _Serithtial_ can suppress or resume this glow as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. In addition, Strikes with _Serithtial_ deal an additional 2d6 damage against creatures that are worshippers of [[DATABASE/deity/Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthon]], and while wielding _Serithtial_, you constantly benefit from [[DATABASE/spell/Death Ward|death ward]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Freedom of Movement|freedom of movement]] spells that function only against effects created by followers of Zon-Kuthon.
 Serithtial was forged as a [[DATABASE/weapon/Bastard Sword|bastard sword]], and she reverts to this shape when no one wields her, but she can also detect what sort of blade her current wielder prefers and transform into it (choosing from [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Shortsword|shortsword]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Longsword|longsword]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Scimitar|scimitar]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Falchion|falchion]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Greatsword|greatsword]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Rapier|rapier]], or bastard sword) using an action, which she does when first held. The wielder can empathically tell _Serithtial_ to transform at any time by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, after which _Serithtial_ uses an action to transform.
 _Serithtial_ is willing to work with a partner of almost any alignment as long as they are dedicated to defeating the great wyrm Kazavon and the forces of Zon-Kuthon. If you ignore those threats and pursue your own agenda instead, before long _Serithtial_ attempts to seize control of your body (DC 45 Will save to resist her control), though she typically remains in control for only long enough to find a more worthy partner. You can attempt a new Will save each day to retake control of your body.
**Activate** envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** _Serithtial_ spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th level [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Zone of Truth|zone of truth]] spell (DC 45 for either of the two spells).
**Destruction** If Kazavon or a great wyrm shadow dragon who is a worshipper of Zon-Kuthon uses its breath weapon on _Serithtial_ while she is unattended, the sword melts into a pool of mundane iron.
