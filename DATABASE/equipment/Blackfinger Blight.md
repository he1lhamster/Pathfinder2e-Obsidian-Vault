This oily, dark purple powder gives off the distinct odor of boiled leather. When delivered, the poison acts quickly to constrict the victim's blood flow to their extremities and turn their lungs into a soft jelly. A victim of blackfinger blight is recognizable by the pores of their fingertips weeping an inky oil that coats their hands and makes it difficult to hold things. Each round, at the beginning of their turn, a creature affected by blackfinger blight must succeed at a flat DC 5 check or drop one random item they're holding.
 **Saving Throw** DC 32 Fortitude; **Onset** 1 round; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 6d6 poison damage (1 round); **Stage 2** 8d6 poison damage (1 round); **Stage 3** 10d6 poison damage and [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] (1 round)
