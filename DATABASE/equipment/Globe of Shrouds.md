The body of this censer is made of transparent crystal banded with dark iron. This globe hangs from a sturdy chain attached to a simple steel rod with a smooth grip.
**Activate****—Light Incense** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (aura, manipulate); **Cost** incense worth at least 5 gp; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** As you light the incense, barely visible smoke issues from the censer in a hazy 20-foot emanation. Creatures that are in the haze or later enter it are wreathed in wisps of smoke; these wisps last while the creature is in the smoke's aura and until the start of its next turn if it leaves the haze. An ally in the aura is [[Concealed]] and gains a +2 status bonus to [[Stealth]] checks. Any enemy in the aura that is or becomes [[Invisible]] appears as a translucent shape to you and your allies—it's no longer [[Hidden]], but it remains concealed.
