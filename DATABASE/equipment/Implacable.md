This substantial rune makes you difficult to hold back. Whenever you are affected by an effect that lasts until you [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] (for instance, from the [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] action or a [[DATABASE/equipment/Tanglefoot Bag|tanglefoot bag]]), you become [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]]. You can use the extra action each round only to Step or Escape.
