_The Rabbit Prince_ represents the unreliability of hand-to-hand combat, and how even cunning foes can lose to lucky novices. As long as you have _The Rabbit Prince_ invested, it grants you a +1 status bonus to attack rolls you make as a readied action.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision (fortune) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You miss a creature with a melee weapon Strike; **Effect** Reroll the triggering Strike with a +1 status bonus. If you hit, attempt a DC 15 flat check; on a failure, your weapon gains the [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]] condition (if your weapon is already broken, it's destroyed). If you're at least 14th level, this flat check is DC 10. If you're at least 17th level, this flat check is DC 5.
