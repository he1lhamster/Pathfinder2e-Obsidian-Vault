This pristine leather belt is made of treated and polished black leather with silver fittings; it features a pair of matching leather holsters that can each fit a one-handed firearm or hand crossbow.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Up to two firearms currently holstered in the _immaculate holsters_ are instantly cleaned and oiled, protecting them from accidental misfires (though not misfires caused as a result of using a feat or ability). The holstered weapons are also reloaded with non-magical 0-level ammunition appropriate to a weapon of their type; if a firearm has multiple chambers, such as a slide pistol, each empty chamber is loaded. _Immaculate holsters_ can't reload the cartridge of a repeating weapon.
