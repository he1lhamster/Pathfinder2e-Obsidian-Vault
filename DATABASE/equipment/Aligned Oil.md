This oil fills a weapon with cosmic power of an alignment. Each _aligned oil_ is crafted to one alignment: chaos, evil, good, or law (such as a _good-aligned oil_). A weapon anointed with this oil gains the effects of the property rune matching its alignment: _anarchic_ (chaos), _axiomatic_ (law), _holy_ (good), or _unholy_ (evil). This lasts for 1 minute.
