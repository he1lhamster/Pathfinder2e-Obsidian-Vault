The _Cube of Nex_ acts as a _[[DATABASE/equipment/Lesser Cube of Nex|Lesser Cube of Nex]]_ except it suppresses all magic within 5 feet of it with the effects of a 10th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Antimagic Field|antimagic field]] spell, instead of just one school. However, spells you cast and magic items you wield ignore the antimagic field from the _Cube of Nex_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** A _cube of force_ or _Lesser Cube of Nex_ within 60 feet of you becomes inert. It can't be Activated, any current activation ends, and any constant abilities it has cease to function.
