When a creature enters the square, spines covered in numerous jagged thorns protrude out to stab it, dealing 8d8 piercing damage and 2d8 persistent bleed damage. The creature must attempt a DC 31 basic Reflex saving throw. After the initial trigger, the spines retract and protrude again repeatedly for 1 minute, forcing any creature that enters the space or ends its turn in the space to attempt a Reflex save against the spines’ damage.
