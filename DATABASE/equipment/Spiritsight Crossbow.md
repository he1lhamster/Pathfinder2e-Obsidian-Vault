This _+1 [[Striking]] [[Ghost Touch]] [[Crossbow]]_ has an array of crystalline lenses and silver fittings along the stock and feels strangely light.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You aim through the crossbow's crystalline lenses, gaining imprecise vision onto the [[Ethereal Plane]] with a range of 60 feet in addition to your normal senses for the rest of your turn. While this effect lasts, your next Strike with the _spiritsight crossbow_ can also affect targets on the Ethereal Plane during the first 60 feet of its flight.
