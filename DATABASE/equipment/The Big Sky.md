_The Big Sky_ represents widespread change or liberation. As long as you have _The Big Sky_ invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to Perception checks made while you are flying outside during the day and to any check made to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]]. The bonus increases to +3 if you are at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** For 10 minutes, you and up to four creatures you touch ignore difficult terrain and effects that would give a circumstance penalty to Speed. If you are at least 17th level, the targets also ignore greater difficult terrain.
