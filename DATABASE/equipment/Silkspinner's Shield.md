This oddly fuzzy [[DATABASE/shield/Buckler|buckler]] (Hardness 10, HP 60, BT 30) resembles the abdomen of a spider. Its defensive side is covered in fine hairs, and two small spinnerets protrude from the bottom of its rim. The spinnerets serve as _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Shield Spikes|shield spikes]]_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You animate the _silkspinner's shield_. Eight spider legs sprout from the shield's rim, granting you a climb Speed of 25 feet until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the spinnerets animate and produce silk for 1 minute. Successful shield bash Strikes made with the _silkspinner's shield_ during this time entangle the target in silk. The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. If your Strike was a critical hit, the target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] for 1 round instead. Regardless, the target can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] (DC 30) to end the effect early.
