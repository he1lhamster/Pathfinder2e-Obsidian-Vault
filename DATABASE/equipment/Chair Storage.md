# Chair Storage<span class="item-type">Item 0</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Price** 1 gp
**Bulk** —

The chair has an efficient allocated space to hold additional items. This reduces the amount of Bulk the items weigh when stored within the chair, much like a [[DATABASE/equipment/Backpack|backpack]]. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your chair don't count against your Bulk limit. If you use both chair storage and a backpack at the same time, only 2 Bulk total isn't counted against your limit, much like if you used multiple backpacks or similar items at the same time.
