_The Fiend_ represents the inevitability of great calamities and pervasive dangers. As long as you have _The Fiend_ invested, when you repeat a non-Strike action you previously took in the same round, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks to perform that action. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You wave the card to create a vision of destruction around you; you cast [[Phantasmal Calamity]], except the area is a 20-foot emanation. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is your class DC. You are immune to the effects of your own _phantasmal calamity_.
