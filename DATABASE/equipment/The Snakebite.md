_The Snakebite_ represents poison, assassination, and disharmony. As long as you have _The Snakebite_ invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks you make for initiative. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you're at least 17th level. The DCs of your poison effects have a +1 item bonus to targets that are [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to you when you afflict the target with the poison (the DC retains this bonus for the target's subsequent saves against the affliction, even if the target is no longer flat-footed to you).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Purple Worm Sting|purple worm sting]] on a creature within your reach, with a DC equal to your class DC.
