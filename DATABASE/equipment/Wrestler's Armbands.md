_Wrestler's armbands_ are a set of _[[Armbands of Athleticism]]_ that have gained their own boisterous sapience. Often, such items aren't created intentionally but rather are the result of a truly charismatic champion whose heart and body are unusually strong wearing the _armbands of athleticism_ on many adventures as their most important item. Eventually, the essence of their earnest and adventurous spirit has so thoroughly inundated the item it gains a matching spirit and will of its own. Such armbands view themselves as a tough, but fair, trainer for whomever inherits them next, inspiring you to new heights of athleticism. They also spoil for contests, telepathically calling out competitors on your behalf; typically the armbands won't challenge a foe you're unprepared to face, but particularly eager wrestler's armbands might have an unfortunate habit of overestimating your abilities and pushing you into a conflict that's beyond your proven capacity. These armbands have the following activation.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per minute; **Trigger** You succeed or critically succeed at an [[Athletics]] check; **Effect** The armbands taunt a creature you're competing with, boasting of your prowess and attempting an Intimidation check to [[Demoralize]] that creature.
