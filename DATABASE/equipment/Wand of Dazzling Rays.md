Solidified radiance comprises this slender, featureless wand. It sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for the next 20 feet. After you Activate the wand, the light fades, so it only sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. The wand returns to its original brightness each dawn.
**Activate** Cast a Spell **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge; **Effect** You cast [[Searing Light]] of the indicated level, dazzling your target with the beam's intensity. A creature that takes damage from the spell is [[Blinded]] for 1 round and [[Dazzled]] for a number of rounds equal to the spell level. On a critical success on the attack roll, the target is also blinded for as long as it's dazzled from the spell. However, it can attempt a Fortitude saving throw against your spell DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the blinded condition on a success (but remaining dazzled).
**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _searing light_ of the appropriate level.
