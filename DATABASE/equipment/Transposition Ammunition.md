_Transposition ammunition_ has a milky-white cast and will sometimes shift position subtly of its own accord. When you activate the ammunition, instead of making your Strike against a foe, you fire _transposition ammunition_ at any unoccupied square you can see within your weapon's first range increment and succeed without making an attack roll. You pull yourself through the [[DATABASE/plane/Astral Plane|Astral Plane]], teleporting along with any items you are holding into the square where you shot the ammunition. If this would carry along any other creature (even one in an extradimensional space), the activation fails.

When you teleport, you can take along up to two willing adjacent creatures. These creatures must each arrive in unoccupied squares adjacent to the _transposition ammunition_; if there's not enough space for both of them, you choose which one is teleported.
