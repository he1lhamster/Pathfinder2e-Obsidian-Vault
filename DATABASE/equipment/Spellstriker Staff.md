A _spellstriker staff_ is wrought iron with gleaming arcane sigils etched into its surface and a sharp point at the bottom. Used as a weapon, the staff is a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Shifting|shifting]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Staff|staff]]_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You use [[DATABASE/action/Spellstrike|Spellstrike]] with a non-cantrip spell and miss with the Strike; **Effect** An explosion of magical energy—stored up for the Spellstrike—explodes out. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation take 1d6 damage per level of the spell, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. This damage is the same type the spell would have dealt, and the activation gains that trait; if the spell would have dealt multiple types of damage, choose one of them. If the damage of the explosion is mental, the save is Will instead of Reflex.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
**Craft Requirements** You have the [[DATABASE/class_/Magus|magus's]] Spellstrike activity. Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
