These bioluminescent jellyfish are as bright as candles, come in a variety of colors, and can act as living lanterns. They dry up and die if removed from the water for more than 1 hour, but as long as they’re allowed access to seawater, they can usually survive for up to 1 year by feeding on micronutrients. Rarely, a well-treated jellyfish lamp might live longer and potentially develop stronger light or additional abilities.
