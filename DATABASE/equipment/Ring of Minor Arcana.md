This rose-gold ring is adorned in the center by a somewhat ominous-looking horned skull. This ring gives you the power to cast the following innate arcane cantrips any number of times each day: [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]], [[DATABASE/spell/Mage Hand|mage hand]], and [[DATABASE/spell/Prestidigitation|prestidigitation]]. Each is cast as a 1st-level spell. If you are an arcane spellcaster, these can instead be heightened to the level of your cantrips.
