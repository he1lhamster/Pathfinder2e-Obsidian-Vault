This luminescent paste is made from the powdered bones of a long-forgotten saint, mixed with herbs and blessed by a priest. It typically comes in a tightly sealed, palm-sized dish etched with holy symbols. Applying _saints’ balm_ to yourself or a creature within reach restores 3d8+10 Hit Points to the creature to which it’s applied.
