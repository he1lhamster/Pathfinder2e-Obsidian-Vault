When you hold this sleek, shiny gray wand, you hear a faint chorus of overlapping whispers.
**Activate** Cast a Spell **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Mind Probe|mind probe]]. The first time the target rolls a success at a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check to mislead your probe, it gets a result one step worse than it rolled. This means you learn the answer if the target's Deception check would have succeeded, and you learn nothing rather than believing a falsehood if the check would have been a critical success.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _mind probe_.
