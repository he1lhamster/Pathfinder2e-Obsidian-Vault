_The Cyclone_ represents tumultuous evil plots. As long as it is invested, _The Cyclone_ bolsters you with helpful winds that grant you a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], [[DATABASE/action/High Jump|High Jump]], [[DATABASE/action/Long Jump|Long Jump]], and [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Whirlwind|whirlwind]]. You do not treat the squares in the _whirlwind_ as difficult terrain, but all other creatures do. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 8th level), and the save DC is your class DC.
