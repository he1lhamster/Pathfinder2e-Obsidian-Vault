These belts are specially designed to allow for writing along the inside surface. You can scribe a spell to a scroll belt, [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Crafting]] the scroll as normal. A scroll belt can only hold a single spell, and you must Cast the Spell before you can scribe another spell to the belt. You can't Cast a Spell from the belt while wearing it; you must remove the belt with an Interact action. A scroll belt acts as a mundane belt, but when a spell is scribed on it, any creature can immediately discern that an unattended belt holds magic. If you're wearing the belt, a creature can notice the belt holds a spell with a successful Perception check against your [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] DC.
