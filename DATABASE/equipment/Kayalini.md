Originally brought to Absalom by [[DATABASE/ancestry/Fetchling|kayals]] fleeing the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]], kayalinis are shy creatures made from shadow. They resemble small [[DATABASE/equipment/Monkey|monkeys]] with reptilian features like claws, short horns, and long, shadowy tongues. When in a new home, they tend to hide under beds or in closets. Around people they trust, they'll sit quietly on a lap for hours.
