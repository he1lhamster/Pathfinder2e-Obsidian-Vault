Threads of iridescent golden silk wrap around the core of this magical [[DATABASE/weapon/Sling Bullets|sling stone]]. When you activate and shoot a _golden chrysalis_, rather than making an attack roll for your Strike, you cause the chrysalis to unwind in midair to reveal a magical butterfly that flies in a 30-foot line, scattering golden scale dust that hangs in the air for 1 minute.
 A creature that enters or begins its turn in the dust must attempt a DC 19 Reflex save or have its invisibility negated, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] instead of [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]]. This effect applies both if the creature was already invisible and if it benefits from any new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from the _golden chrysalis_.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target's invisibility is negated for 2 rounds.
**Failure** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 minute and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.
