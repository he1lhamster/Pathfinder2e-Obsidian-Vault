The opal set in the intricately carved ivory _spiritsight ring_ eventually becomes translucent and tickles your finger whenever an incorporeal creature is nearby. When in the presence of a nearby incorporeal creature, even if it's within a solid object, you eventually detect the creature, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint the location. This acts as a vague sense, like humans' sense of smell. An incorporeal creature trying to hide its presence from this sense attempts a [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check against your Perception DC to hide from your vague sense, as normal for attempting to foil special senses. You gain a +2 item bonus when using the [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] action to find [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] incorporeal creatures within 30 feet of you.
