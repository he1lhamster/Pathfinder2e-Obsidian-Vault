Made of pure gold with platinum strings, the _phistophilus fiddle_ shouldn't be able to play a note—but play it does, so beautifully that it can move almost any audience. The fiddle was stolen from the [[DATABASE/monster/Phistophilus (Contract Devil)|contract devil]] who created it, and the cunning fiend still wants to reclaim the instrument. Fiendish misfortunes often befall its owners, allowing it to switch hands. The fiddle is a handheld [[DATABASE/equipment/Musical Instrument|virtuoso instrument]].
