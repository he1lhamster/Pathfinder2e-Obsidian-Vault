This black-and-gray ammunition is etched with occult symbols and tiny, grinning skulls. When activated _terrifying ammunition_ damages a creature, it fills the creature's mind with visions of their own failures, tragedies, and eventually, their own death. The creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[Frightened]].
**Failure** The creature is frightened 1 and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 until it spends an action, which has the concentrate trait, to calm itself down.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is frightened 2.
