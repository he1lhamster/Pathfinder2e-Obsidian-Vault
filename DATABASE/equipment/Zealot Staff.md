A _zealot staff's_ color, iconography, and materials vary depending on the faith it's dedicated to. An [[DATABASE/deity/Iomedae|Iomedaean]] staff might be forged of gold and shaped like an ornamental sword, while a [[DATABASE/deity/Lamashtu|Lamashtan]] one could instead be made of blackened iron depicting monstrous faces. Used as a weapon, the staff is a _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Staff|staff]]_.
 The staff represents vehement support of the deity to whom the staff is dedicated, punishing defiance. When the staff's effects require choosing alignments, you can choose only that deity's alignments. No such staves exist for deities that are true neutral. When you prepare this staff, if you don't worship its deity, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] until your next daily preparations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Trigger** You hit with a Strike using the staff; **Effect** Choose one of the represented deity's alignments besides neutral. You expend 1 charge from the staff and deal 1d4 damage per damage die of the staff. This damage is of the alignment type you chose.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
