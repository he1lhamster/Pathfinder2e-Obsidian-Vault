From blade to pommel, this sword is carved from a branch of the now-extinct celestial peach tree. The blade of this _+3 [[Striking]] [[Disrupting]] [[Holy]] [[Peachwood Weapon]] [[Shortsword]]_ has ancient runes that can permanently destroy the most powerful undead—if you are willing to pay the price. An undead creature of 12th level or lower that takes damage from a Strike with the sword takes 10d6 positive damage (DC 35 basic Fortitude save). This damage is separate from the Strike itself and isn't included in any effect based on the Strike's damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Trigger** You critically hit an undead creature with the _celestial peachwood sword_; **Requirements** once per day; **Effect** The creature must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be destroyed. If the undead fails its saving throw and is destroyed, you suffer a backlash, taking 1d6 negative damage per level of the destroyed undead.
