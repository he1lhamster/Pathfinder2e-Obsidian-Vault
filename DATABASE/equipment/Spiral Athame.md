The pommel of this +4 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|major striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|disruptive]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|high-grade silver]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|dagger]] is a black glass orb that contains a tiny blue comet that spirals through the orb's interior. Strikes with the dagger deal an additional 1d8 positive damage to worshippers of [[DATABASE/deity/Urgathoa|Urgathoa]] and to anyone who has ever created or summoned an undead creature.
 While the dagger is in your possession, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] checks and to [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Midwifery Lore]] checks. If you're a worshipper of [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]], you gain imprecise [[DATABASE/monsterability/Lifesense|lifesense]] with a range of 60 feet while holding the dagger. If you're undead or a worshipper of Urgathoa, you're [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 4]] while holding the dagger.
 Despite its utility in combat, the _Spiral Athame_ is intended as a ritual implement, meant to bless newborns and protect them from the predations of undead. If you use the _Spiral Athame_ to cut the umbilical cord of a newly born creature, that creature gains resistance to negative damage equal to their level (minimum 1) and gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws against death effects and necromancy. These bonuses are permanent. Additionally, that creature can never become an undead creature.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, interact (divine, necromancy) ; **Effect** You point the _Spiral Athame_ at a corpse within 30 feet, shielding it from corruption. The _Spiral Athame_ casts 5th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Gentle Repose|gentle repose]] on the corpse.
**Destruction** If an undead creature uses the _Spiral Athame_ to slay a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomp]] usher while within the [[DATABASE/plane/Boneyard|Boneyard]], the _Spiral Athame's_ pommel shatters and the _Spiral Athame_ becomes a mundane, high-grade silver dagger with no special abilities.
