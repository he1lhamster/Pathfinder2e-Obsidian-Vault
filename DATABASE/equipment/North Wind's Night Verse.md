This _+1 [[Striking]] [[Frost]] [[Katana]]_ is always cool to the touch, nearly uncomfortably so. Unadorned and with no tsuba, its honed blade is carved from a single tusk of [[Dragon Turtle]] ivory and wrapped in strips of [[Winter Wolf]] hide. Strikes with the katana gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against creatures that have a status penalty to their Speed or are [[Slowed]]. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a _greater striking rune_ and +4 for _major striking_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command (cold, evocation, magical) **Frequency** once per 1 minute; **Trigger** Your spell deals cold damage to a creature; **Effect** Choose one creature dealt cold damage by the spell. It takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
