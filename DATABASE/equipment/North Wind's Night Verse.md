This _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost|frost]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Katana|katana]]_ is always cool to the touch, nearly uncomfortably so. Unadorned and with no tsuba, its honed blade is carved from a single tusk of [[DATABASE/monster/Dragon Turtle|dragon-turtle]] ivory and wrapped in strips of [[DATABASE/monster/Winter Wolf|winter wolf]] hide. Strikes with the katana gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against creatures that have a status penalty to their Speed or are [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]]. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a _greater striking rune_ and +4 for _major striking_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> command (cold, evocation, magical) **Frequency** once per 1 minute; **Trigger** Your spell deals cold damage to a creature; **Effect** Choose one creature dealt cold damage by the spell. It takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
