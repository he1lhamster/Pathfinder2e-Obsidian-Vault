You tap into the fiendish ability to slip through space. When you Stride, you gain a +3 item bonus to Armor Class against reactions triggered by your movement. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can call on a provision in your Thrune contract as a single action, causing you to become [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 hour or until Abrogail releases you, whichever comes first.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You recite a subclause of your contract regarding change in venue. You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dimension Door|dimension door]]. The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with the scent of brimstone, dealing 2d6 evil damage to creatures adjacent to both spaces.
