You tap into the fiendish ability to slip through space. When you Stride, you gain a +3 item bonus to Armor Class against reactions triggered by your movement. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can call on a provision in your Thrune contract as a single action, causing you to become [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 hour or until Abrogail releases you, whichever comes first.
