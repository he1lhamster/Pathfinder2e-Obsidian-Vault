A _bane_ rune causes a weapon to grant you improved understanding of creatures of a particular type, allowing you to deal more damage to those creatures. The crafter chooses aberration, animal, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, monitor, ooze, or both fungus and plant. The weapon deals 1d6 additional damage of the weapon's damage type to creatures with the chosen trait or traits. The benefit doesn't apply against creatures of the chosen type disguised as other creatures. It's up to GM discretion whether the _bane_ rune applies against a creature disguised as a creature of the chosen type.
 The GM might allow _bane_ runes for other creature traits, such as astral, dream, or demon. However, humanoids, undead, and specific types of humanoids (such as [[DATABASE/ancestry/Elf|elves]]) are never a valid option.
