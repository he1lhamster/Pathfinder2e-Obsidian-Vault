A gecko potion is a sticky, tawny brown liquid with flecks of sand suspended in it. For 5 minutes after drinking this potion, your fingertips sprout thousands of microscopic, bristled hairs that cling to objects, granting you a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]] and [[DATABASE/action/Palm an Object|Palm an Object]], and to your Reflex DC against [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] attempts.
