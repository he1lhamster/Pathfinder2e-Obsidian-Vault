While inubrix weapons don't pack the same punch as more durable weapons, they have the unique ability to bypass some of the protections offered by metal armors and shields. A weapon crafted from inubrix reduces the weapon's damage die by 1 size. However, they ignore the resistance to damage from metal armor's armor specialization effects and the circumstance bonus to AC from metal shields. Strikes with inubrix weapons don't trigger the [[Shield Block]] reaction from a metal shield. Weapons that normally deal 1d4 damage can't be crafted from inubrix.
