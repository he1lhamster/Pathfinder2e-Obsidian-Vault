This bottle contains a shrunken bird preserved with its feathers intact. When opened, the contents reconstitute into a Gargantuan effigy of a great [[Roc]], which can appear in the air instead of on the ground. The roc [[Grab]] up to two creatures, then [[Fly]] up to 90 feet and [[Release]] the creatures. The creatures must be within 15 feet of the roc for it to Grab them; if any of them are unwilling to be [[Grabbed]], the roc must [[Grapple]] them with a +17 [[Athletics]] modifier or fail to pick them up.
**Craft Requirements** Supply the corpse of a roc.
