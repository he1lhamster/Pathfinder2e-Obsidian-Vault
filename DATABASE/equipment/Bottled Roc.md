This bottle contains a shrunken bird preserved with its feathers intact. When opened, the contents reconstitute into a Gargantuan effigy of a great [[DATABASE/monster/Roc|roc]], which can appear in the air instead of on the ground. The roc [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grabs]] up to two creatures, then [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Flies]] up to 90 feet and [[DATABASE/action/Release|Releases]] the creatures. The creatures must be within 15 feet of the roc for it to Grab them; if any of them are unwilling to be [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], the roc must [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] them with a +17 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] modifier or fail to pick them up.
**Craft Requirements** Supply the corpse of a roc.
