Concocted from the formulas provided by otherworldly refugees to Irrisen, mustard powder is rumored to be devastating to entire armies with proper dispersal. Recipes have quickly spread across Golarion. Mustard powder's [[Sickened]] condition ends when the poison's other effects do.
 **Saving Throw** DC 22 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 1d6 poison damage and [[Dazzled]] (1 round); **Stage 2** 2d4 poison damage, dazzled, sickened 1, and unable to smell (1 round); **Stage 3** 2d6 poison damage, dazzled, sickened 2, and unable to smell (1 round)
