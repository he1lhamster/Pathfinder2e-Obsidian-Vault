Coiled tentacles make it all but impossible to see anything else inside this ampoule. When opened, a Gargantuan [[DATABASE/monster/Kraken|kraken]] bursts forth, which can appear in water instead of on the ground. Its arms attempt to grasp up to four creatures with a reach of 60 feet. The kraken repositions grabbed creatures to a different space within its reach unless the target succeeds at a DC 38 Fortitude save.
 If the kraken is in water, it then releases a cloud of ink in an 80-foot emanation. This cloud has no effect outside of water. Creatures inside the cloud are [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]], can't use their sense of smell, and are exposed to kraken ink poison. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.
**Kraken Ink** (poison) Krakens are immune to this poison. **Saving Throw** DC 39 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 10 rounds; **Stage 1** 3d6 poison damage and [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (1 round); **Stage 2** 4d6 poison damage and sickened 2 (1 round).
**Craft Requirements** Supply the corpse of a kraken.
