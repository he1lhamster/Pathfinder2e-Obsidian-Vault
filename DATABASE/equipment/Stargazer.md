When you invest this [[DATABASE/equipment/Crystal Ball|clear quartz crystal ball]], it orbits your head like an [[DATABASE/equipment/Aeon Stone|aeon stone]]. As long as you have the _stargazer_ invested, you can use an Interact action to direct it to orbit one of your hands where you can telekinetically smash the orb into foes, wielding it as a _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Returning|returning]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Club|club]]_. While you're directing the _stargazer_, your hand is full, and you can send it back to your head with another Interact action. On a critical hit, the _stargazer_ pulses with hypnotic starlight, [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzling]] the struck creature for 1 round. A stargazer doesn't add critical specialization effects.
