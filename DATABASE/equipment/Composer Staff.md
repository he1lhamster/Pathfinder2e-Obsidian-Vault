A _composer staff_ is short and shaped like an elegant black conductor's baton with a silver tip. When waved through the air, it hums melodically. In this way, you can play it as though it were an instrument, and it grants a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks made with it.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
