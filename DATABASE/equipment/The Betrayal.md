_The Betrayal_ represents selfishness and envy, twisting outcomes toward unfavorable or even devastating results. As long as _The Betrayal_ is invested, you become more adept at hiding who you really are and tricking targets into positions of vulnerability. You gain a +2 item bonus on [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] or [[DATABASE/action/Feint|Feint]]. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You turn the tables on your foes, bringing one of them into your ranks and compelling them to attack their allies. You cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] on a creature, but can only issue commands to attack or otherwise harm, betray, or inconvenience its allies. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is your class DC.
