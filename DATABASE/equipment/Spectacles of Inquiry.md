Anything viewed through these thin spectacles looks crisp and clear, and the earpieces accentuate sounds around you. You gain a +2 item bonus to Perception checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The spectacles key in on someone to show you their social cues in perfect clarity. Choose a creature you can see. You gain a +3 item bonus on Perception checks you make to use [[Sense Motive]] against that creature. This benefit lasts until you Activate the item again in this way.
 If you're an [[Investigator]], you can use this activation as part of the action you take to [[Devise a Stratagem]] or [[Pursue a Lead]], and you can do the latter even though you can't see the creature. You must choose the same creature you chose for Devise a Stratagem or Pursue a Lead.
**Craft Requirements** You are an investigator.
