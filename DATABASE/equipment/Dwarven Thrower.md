This _+2 striking [[DATABASE/weapon/Warhammer|warhammer]]_ is inlaid with precious metals and decorated with geometric patterns in a dwarven style. If you’re a [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarf]], a _dwarven thrower_ functions for you as a _+2 greater striking [[DATABASE/equipment/Returning|returning]] warhammer_ with the thrown 30 feet trait, and your attacks with the hammer deal 1d8 additional damage against giants.
