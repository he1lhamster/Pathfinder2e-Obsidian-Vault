_Sleep arrows_ often have shafts of deep blue or black, and their fletching is exceptionally soft and downy. An activated _sleep arrow_ deals no damage, but a living creature hit by it is subject to the effects of a [[DATABASE/spell/Sleep|sleep]] spell (DC 17).
**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of _sleep_.
