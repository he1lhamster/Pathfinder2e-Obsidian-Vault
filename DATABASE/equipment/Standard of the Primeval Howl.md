These standards are always constructed from uncut wood and a leather banner painted with the visage of a snarling beast—a wolf, boar, bear, lion, dragon, or similarly imposing creature. And while it might become lost on a battlefield scattered with gaudier standards, its effect bolsters those around a competent leader. When carrying this banner, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks and initiative rolls, and creatures in a 20-foot emanation also gain a +1 item bonus to initiative checks.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** An ally within 20 feet of you critically hits with a Strike; **Requirements** You have the [[DATABASE/feat/Battle Cry|Battle Cry]] skill feat; **Effect** You attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the foe the Strike hit.
