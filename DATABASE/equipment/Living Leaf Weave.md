This suit of [[DATABASE/armor/Leaf Weave|leaf weave armor]] is specially modified to metabolize the alchemical accelerants in medicinal compounds. A special receptacle in the armor can hold an [[DATABASE/equipment/Elixir of Life|elixir of life]], which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded suit of living leaf weave can be activated to grow slithering vines from the armor, granting an item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]], to your Fortitude DC to resist Grapple, [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]], or [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] attempts, and to your Reflex DCs to resist [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] attempts. The effects last for 3 rounds, consuming the elixir of life, and once the reaction has begun it can't be deactivated.
