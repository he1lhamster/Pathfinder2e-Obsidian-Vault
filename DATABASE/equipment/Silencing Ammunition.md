_Silencing ammunition_ is particularly dense and seems to dampen sounds around it. On a successful Strike, an activated piece of _silencing ammunition_ creates a 2nd-level [[DATABASE/spell/Silence|silence]] effect on the target. The target can resist the effects of the ammunition with a successful DC 25 Will save, though it takes a –2 circumstance penalty if the Strike was a critical hit. While the effect is active, the target can use an Interact action to try to tug out the arrow or bolt and end the effect early; this requires a successful DC 25 Will save.
