This root is often infused into bandages for life-threatening bleeding. Activating the item is part of the same activity you use to Administer First Aid to stop [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|bleeding]] on a creature who's also [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]]. When you do, you can Administer First Aid to stop bleeding and dying as part of the same activity with only one [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check. However, the DC for the Medicine check is equal to the 5 + the higher of the two DCs to Administer First Aid.
