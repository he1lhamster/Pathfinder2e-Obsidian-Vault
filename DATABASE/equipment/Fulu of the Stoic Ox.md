The ox on this fulu rests vigilantly on the point of the armor right over the bearer's heart, protecting the bearer against diseases and safeguarding their health. When you activate the fulu, you gain a +2 status bonus on the triggering Fortitude save and on all Fortitude saves against the same disease for the next minute.
