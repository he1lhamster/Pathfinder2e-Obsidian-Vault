Initially crafted by a gifted inventor who no longer had the use of their legs, the _inventor's chair_ is a [[DATABASE/equipment/Traveler's Chair|traveler's chair]].

The chair comes equipped with [[DATABASE/equipment/Wheel Blades|wheel blades]], and portions of its frame contain [[DATABASE/equipment/Artisan's Tools|sterling artisan's tools]]. The _inventor's chair_ might be a family heirloom or a gift from someone who inherited it. It could instead sit unused in its inventor's abandoned estate, awaiting another user.
