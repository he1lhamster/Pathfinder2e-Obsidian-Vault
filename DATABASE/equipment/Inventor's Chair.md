Initially crafted by a gifted inventor who no longer had the use of their legs, the _inventor's chair_ is a [[Traveler's Chair]]. It's a marvel of engineering, utilizing clockwork mechanisms to maneuver about. The chair comes equipped with [[Wheel Blades]], and portions of its frame contain [[Artisan's Tools]]. The _inventor's chair_ might be a family heirloom or a gift from someone who inherited it. It could instead sit unused in its inventor's abandoned estate, awaiting another user.
