You negotiate for might and viciousness. 
**Benefit** Your successful Strikes with slashing and piercing melee weapons deal 1 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]. On a critical success, this persistent bleed damage is equal to half your level. 
**Payment** You regain half the normal number of Hit Points from resting (including Hit Points gained from long-term rest) and from any application of the [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] skill. 
**Hidden Condition** The barbazu owns any weapons you find. No more often than once per month, the barbazu can demand a single weapon of its choice (often the best weapon in your possession). You are compelled to hand over the weapon immediately, without question. 
**Termination Clause** The contract guarantees that you will not “be slain by the barbazu or by barbazu action.” This wording is vague; if any barbazu kills you, or if you die from persistent bleed damage from any source, the contract is voided.
