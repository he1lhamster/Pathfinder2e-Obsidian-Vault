Light and strong, noqual also demonstrates a powerful resistance to magic. A side effect of this resistance is that making magical weapons out of noqual requires complex and expensive alchemical treatments. Kevoth-Kul, the Black Sovereign of Numeria, has developed an alloy of noqual and cold iron known as [[DATABASE/equipment/Sovereign Steel|sovereign steel]] to help mitigate this property. The metal's crystalline appearance might suggest that it's fragile, but the pale-green material can be worked similarly to iron. Objects made of noqual have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item attempts and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the [[DATABASE/spell/Rusting Grasp|rusting grasp]] spell).
