This bottle contains a shrunken [[DATABASE/monster/Hippogriff|hippogriff]]. When opened, the contents reconstitute into a Large effigy of a hippogriff. The hippogriff waits up to 1 round and allows two creatures to mount it, then Flies up to 65 feet and waits 1 more round to give the mounted creatures time to dismount. Creatures who are still mounted on the hippogriff when it dissolves fall [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] in the space where the hippogriff corpse ends its movement.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a hippogriff corpse.
