A _stone circle_ appears to be a thumb-sized rectangular gray stone until activated.
**Activate** (1 minute) envision, Interact **Frequency** once per week; **Effect** When the circle is stood on the ground and activated, the stone grows into a massive stone pillar 13 feet high, 7 feet across, and weighing 25 tons. Identical pillars rise up from the ground marking a circle 100 feet across, with capstones connecting the pillars. There must be enough space to deploy the circle or it won't activate. During the activation, you align the _stone circle_ to face a single astronomical feature, such as the sun, the moon, or a constellation. You can revert the _stone circle_ back to its original state by using an Interact action to push over the original stone pillar. Once you do, the rest of the _stone circle_ collapses in a dramatic fashion, the stones falling, cracking, and disintegrating into dust. If you don't begin a ritual inside of the _stone circle_ within 1 day of its activation, it reverts back to its original state.
 When you cast a ritual of 5th level or lower within the _stone circle_, the first failure on a secondary check is improved by one degree of success (a critical failure becomes a failure and a failure becomes a success). Once you complete a ritual within the _stone circle_, regardless of the result, the stones collapse and it reverts back to its original form.

The circle can be activated once per day. It provides its benefit when casting a ritual of any level, and it improves the secondary check with the worst degree of success by one degree of success, even if that secondary check succeeded.
