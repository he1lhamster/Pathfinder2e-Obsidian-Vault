A basic prosthesis replaces a missing or damaged body part. Typical prostheses include artificial feet, eyes, hands, and limbs, though a basic prosthesis can be designed as a replacement for any body part. A prosthesis has a number of belts or cuffs that keep it attached to your body. You can attach or remove a prosthesis as an Interact action.
