_The Bear_ represents brute force applied to solve unusual problems. As long as you have _The Bear_ invested, you can use [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] or [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeeze]].
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per minute; **Requirements** Your last action was a successful melee Strike; **Effect** You attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]], [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]], or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] the creature you hit with the successful Strike, even if you have no hand free. You gain a +2 status bonus to your check. If you Grapple using a weapon, you can Strike with the weapon only if it has the grapple trait and you Strike the [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] target, or if you cease Grabbing with the weapon. After the effect of the initial Grapple ends, you can't keep a target grabbed with a weapon that lacks the grapple trait. The status bonus increases to +3 if you're at least 17th level.
