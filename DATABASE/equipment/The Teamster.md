_The Teamster_ represents the driving force to push on, no matter the circumstance. As long as you have _The Teamster_ invested, all single-target effects that target you and require a saving throw gain the incapacitation trait. If the effect originates from a creature or effect of a level higher than yours, it doesn't gain the incapacitation trait in this way.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** you are affected by an ongoing condition; **Effect** You push through your largest hindrance. Select one of the following conditions currently affecting you: [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]], [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy]], [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]], [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]], [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]], [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]], [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]], grappled, [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]], [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]], [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned]], [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Wounded|wounded]]. If the source of the condition is more than 4 levels lower than your current level, The Teamster automatically counters the condition. Otherwise, The Teamster attempts to counter the condition, with a counteract modifier of +31.
