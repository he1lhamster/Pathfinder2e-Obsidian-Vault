_The Teamster_ represents the driving force to push on, no matter the circumstance. As long as you have _The Teamster_ invested, all single-target effects that target you and require a saving throw gain the incapacitation trait. If the effect originates from a creature or effect of a level higher than yours, it doesn't gain the incapacitation trait in this way.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** you are affected by an ongoing condition; **Effect** You push through your largest hindrance. Select one of the following conditions currently affecting you: [[Blinded]], [[Clumsy]], [[Confused]], [[Controlled]], [[Dazzled]], [[Deafened]], [[Doomed]], [[Drained]], [[Dying]], [[Enfeebled]], [[Fascinated]], [[Fatigued]], [[Frightened]], grappled, [[Immobilized]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Persistent Damage]], [[Petrified]], [[Restrained]], [[Sickened]], [[Slowed]], [[Stunned]], [[Stupefied]], [[Unconscious]], or [[Wounded]]. If the source of the condition is more than 4 levels lower than your current level, The Teamster automatically counters the condition. Otherwise, The Teamster attempts to counter the condition, with a counteract modifier of +31.
