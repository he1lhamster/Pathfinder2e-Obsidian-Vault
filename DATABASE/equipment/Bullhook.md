A _bullhook_ is a stout rod about 4 feet long with a blunt hook on the end. Too dull to be useful as a weapon, a _bullhook_ is instead used to direct animals in training or in performing their tasks. A _bullhook_ grants you an item bonus to [[Nature]] checks to [[Command an Animal]] while you are holding it.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You wave the _bullhook_ to produce the effects of a [[Command]] spell. This spell loses the linguistic trait and can target only animals.
**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _command_ of the appropriate level.
