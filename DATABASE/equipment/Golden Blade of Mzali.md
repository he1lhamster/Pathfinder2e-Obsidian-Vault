Each of these golden spears was forged in the days of old Mzali, when the sun kings ruled the city. The majority of these weapons are lost, most likely buried with warriors in tombs and temples sealed by [[Walkena]] decrees. Walkena retains a single golden blade, which he grants to his Master of Spears.
 This _+2 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Spear]]_ is coated in brilliant gold, and beautiful engravings run along the shaft, depicting the rising and setting of the sun against Mzali's skyline. The spear glows with the effects of 4th-level [[Light]]. You can suppress or resume this light by using an action, which has the concentrate trait. When you hit a creature with the spear, it takes 1d6 additional fire damage. When you critically hit a creature with the spear, the creature takes 1d8 [[Persistent Damage]] and 1d8 persistent bleed damage as its blood boils away. Unlike normal when taking two types of persistent damage, a creature needs only a single successful flat check to remove both the fire and bleed damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You critically hit a creature with the weapon; **Effect** You call upon the spear's light to guide the creature away from violence. The creature must choose one of the following options:

* The creature surrenders, immediately receiving the critical failure effects of [[Calm Emotions]] and [[Paralyze]].
* The weapon casts 7th-level [[Blindness]] on the creature with a DC of 34.

Regardless of the choice, the spear loses its ability to glow with light until your next daily preparations.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The spear casts 7th-level [[Elemental Form]] on you, choosing fire as the form's trait. The spear loses its additional fire damage until your next daily preparations.
