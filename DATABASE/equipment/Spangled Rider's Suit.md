This _+1 resilient [[Studded Leather Armor]]_ is adorned with colorful sequins that sparkle in even the faintest light. While wearing the spangled rider’s suit, you gain a +2 item bonus to [[Command an Animal]] you are riding. Any animal you ride automatically knows the [[Drop Prone]] and [[Step]] basic actions, in addition to any other basic actions it knows (normally only Leap, Seek, Stand, Stride, and Strike).
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (move) **Trigger** You take damage while mounted or your mount Drops Prone; **Effect** You dismount, moving off your mount into a space adjacent to it.
