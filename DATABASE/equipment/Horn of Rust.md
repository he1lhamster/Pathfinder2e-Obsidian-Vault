This rusted, coiled iron horn is sizable, appearing similar in shape to a ram's horn but measuring nearly 2 feet in diameter. Flakes of rust constantly fall from this item, and it leaves hands with a rusty red stain that lingers. While the _Horn of Rust's_ power has diminished over the ages since Xar-Azmak's death, those who carry it are still subject to its palpable chaotic influences. If you aren't chaotic evil, you are [[Enfeebled]] while carrying or using the _Horn of Rust_, and if you're lawful or good, you are instead [[Enfeebled]] and stupefied 1. The longer a non-worshipper of Xar-Azmak carries the _Horn of Rust_, the greater the chances a [[Vloriak (Despoiler Demon)]] or other [[Demon]] (or group of demons) will seek them out to slay them and reclaim the artifact. The frequency of these attacks is left to the GM to determine, but they should occur no less frequently than once a month. These attacks should always be at least moderate encounters; if the PCs don't take them seriously, the attacks could eventually escalate into severe encounters.
 Some of the _Horn of Rust's_ activated powers consume charges, similar to how a magic staff functions. When its charges are reduced to zero, its activations that require charges can still be used normally. It can be prepared with charges in the same method as a staff, and it counts as a staff for the limit of how many staves you can prepare in a day.
**Activate** Cast a Spell ; **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the Horn of Rust to cast a spell from the following list.

* **Cantrip** [[Divine Lance]] (chaotic or evil damage only)
* **1st** [[Noxious Vapors]]
* **2nd** [[Shatter]]
* **3rd** [[Stinking Cloud]]

The following activations do not consume charges from the Horn of Rust, and they can be utilized even when the artifact has no charges available.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You blow on the horn to unleash a swirling aura of jagged, rusty metal shards that orbit you in a 5-foot emanation for 1 minute. The shards grant you a +1 item bonus to AC. Creatures and objects that begin their turn in this area take 6d6 slashing damage from the shards (DC 19 basic Reflex save). A creature damaged by this aura is exposed to a potent form of [[Tetanus]] that has a level equal to the _Horn of Rust's_ level and has a DC 19 Fortitude save. Worshippers of Xar-Azmak are immune to this effect.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You place the horn's bell against a diseased creature and then inhale into the mouthpiece rather than blow into it. The horn attempts to draw out the disease, casting a [[Remove Disease]] spell to your specification with a counteract modifier of +11. If the _Horn of Rust_ succeeds at countering a disease, it gains a number of charges equal to half the disease's level (rounded down, minimum 1). If it critically fails, not only is the disease not countered, but you are exposed to the disease and must attempt a saving throw against it to resist contracting the affliction.

**Xar-Azmak Resurrected** If the demon lord Xar-Azmak is resurrected, the _Horn of Rust_ becomes a 20th-level item. Its swirling aura of rusty metal shards grants a +3 item bonus to AC, deals 20d6 slashing damage (DC 43 basic Reflex save), and the tetanus has a DC 43 Fortitude save. It has a +31 counteract modifier against diseases. You can cast the following additional spells using the artifact's charges.

* **4th** [[Rusting Grasp]]
* **5th** [[Cloudkill]]
* **6th** [[Disintegrate]]
* **7th** [[Divine Decree]] (chaotic or evil only)
* **8th** [[Horrid Wilting]]
* **9th** [[Disjunction]]
* **10th** [[Cataclysm]]
**Destruction** The _Horn of Rust_ must be washed with the juice of a fresh peach plucked from an immortal [[Arboreal]], then dipped into a pool of molten [[Mithral]], and finally cooled with the tears of a remorseful demon. Alternatively, GMs can devise a series of their own quests for the PCs and send them to destroy this ancient artifact. Once the horn is destroyed, Xar-Azmak can never be resurrected.
