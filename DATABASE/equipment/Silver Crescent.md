A piquant tamarind and chili-lime flavor infuses a silver crescent, which was first created to aid those battling the undead. For 1 hour, you shed cool, white light like a [[DATABASE/equipment/Torch|torch]], and you gain an item bonus to saving throws against olfactory effects according to the crescent's type. While shedding this light, you can't be [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] if you're visible, and if you're [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], you're concealed instead rather than being [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]].
 **Secondary Effect** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Effect** A ray of light descends on a 5-foot square of your choice within 120 feet. Any creature in that space takes positive damage with a basic Reflex save and is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the end of its next turn on a failed save. This is treated as [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|silver]] for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. The silver crescent becomes inert.
