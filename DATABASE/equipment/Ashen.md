In his attempts to recreate the initial feeling of the object he encountered ages ago, the Ash Engineer discovered a different effect, one that would confound his enemies. _Ashen_ weapons are typically coated in a thin layer of ash that gradually returns over the span of a day, even after wiping away. A creature hit by an attack from an _ashen_ weapon becomes surrounded by burning ash, which deals 1d4 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]]. This ash clouds the senses, causing the creature to become [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save.
