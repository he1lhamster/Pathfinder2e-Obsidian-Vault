A vaccine grants a creature immunity to a specific strain of disease of a level equal to or less than the vaccine's level, and a +2 item bonus on all saving throws against other strains of the same disease. For example, a vaccine could grant immunity to filth fever inflicted by [[Otyugh]] but would only grant a +2 saving throw bonus against filth fever inflicted by a [[Giant Rat]].
 **Special** A vaccine is the same rarity as the disease it's designed to prevent, or as the creature who inflicts the disease if the disease itself doesn't list a rarity
**Craft Requirements** Creating a vaccine requires a sample of the disease in question.
