A grinning skull tops the bow of this macabre key. This key can be used in place of [[DATABASE/equipment/Thieves' Tools|thieves’ tools]] when attempting to Pick a Lock, and it grants a +1 item bonus to the Thievery check. If the _skeleton key_ becomes broken due to a critical failure on the check, it works as normal thieves’ tools and loses its benefits until repaired.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You attempt to Pick a Lock but haven’t rolled yet; **Effect** The key casts [[DATABASE/spell/Knock|knock]] on the lock you’re trying to pick.
