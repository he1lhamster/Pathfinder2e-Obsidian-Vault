Carved of bone, _luckless dice_ appear to be a set of [[DATABASE/equipment/Games|loaded dice]]. If unsuccessfully identified as cursed, _luckless dice_ seem to hold a minor enchantment that improves your luck. However, they fuse to you when you use them, cursing you with ill fortune. _Luckless dice_ don't grant a bonus on [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Games Lore]] checks. Instead, when you use them to gamble, the GM rolls secretly, granting you the lower result. Once you realize the dice are cursed, the GM can instead allow you to roll twice and take the lower result.
