This _+1 striking [[DATABASE/weapon/Jezail|jezail]]_ is built from white hot metal and has a ruby fused into the palm wood stock. When the _iris of the sky_ misfires, you take 5 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]].
 The first firearm of this type came as the result of a gunslinger who entreated an [[DATABASE/monster/Efreeti|efreeti]], wishing for the might of the desert sun. The weapon constantly glows and burns with a brilliant intensity. The firearm has since belonged to an extensive string of users and been replicated several times, though each wielder of the weapon, whether the original or one of its copies, has eventually ended up as a charred husk, slain by fire in battle or unusual accidents that no one could quite explain except, perhaps, the efreet.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You focus the solar energy housed in the ruby to release a gout of solar flame instead of a bullet. Make a Strike with the _iris of the sky_. All damage from this Strike is fire damage and the target takes an additional 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 persistent fire damage.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, envision (fortune) **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You make a wish into the _iris of the sky_, yearning for it to strike true, and then fire. Strike against a foe with the iris, rolling the attack roll twice and taking the better result. If the attack is a failure, you take 5 persistent fire damage.
