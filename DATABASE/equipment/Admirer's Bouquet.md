An _admirer's bouquet_ appears to be a colorful silken handkerchief that exudes a pleasant floral scent until it's picked up, at which point a dozen vibrantly colored long-stemmed flowers appear in the carrier's hand, the stems wrapped in the silk.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** By taking a deep sniff of the pleasant-smelling flowers, you can speed your recovery from nausea and reduce your [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] value by 1.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** an ally with a free hand ends their turn adjacent to you; **Effect** You hand the _admirer's bouquet_ to the triggering ally. If they accept the bouquet, they gain a +1 item bonus to saves against emotion and mental effects as long as they continue to carry the _admirer's bouquet_. If they're currently suffering from a debilitating emotion or mental effect as the result of a saving throw made during the previous turn, they can immediately attempt a new saving throw against that effect upon being given the bouquet; if they do so, they gain the _admirer's bouquet's_ +1 item bonus to this saving throw. An _admirer's bouquet_ can allow for a new saving throw in this way only once per day.
