Even while affixed, this electric blue feather sways lightly in the air, as if always accompanied by a breeze. When activated, the talisman casts [[DATABASE/spell/Fly|fly]] on you, though the duration is 1 minute. You can Dismiss this activation. If you do, you're affected by [[DATABASE/spell/Feather Fall|feather fall]].
