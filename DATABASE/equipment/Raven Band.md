This armband is woven from overlapping raven feathers, including one large feather from a [[DATABASE/monster/Kadlaka|kadlaka]]. As long as you wear it, you understand what ravens are saying, but you can't speak to ravens unless you activate the _raven band_.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** When you stroke the kadlaka feather, the _raven band_ gives you the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]], except that you can speak with and understand only birds, not other animals.
