This knife is a _+1 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Dagger]]_ with a wide blade and thick wooden handle. A prayer for protection from evil magic is carved into the handle in tiny script, running around the handle in a spiral. The grooves of the carved prayer provide a good grip on the knife and make it easy to catch when it returns to your hand.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You critically hit with the weapon; **Effect** The dagger casts a 4th-level [[Dispel Magic]] targeting the most powerful spell effect affecting the creature you critically hit. The counteract check is +15.
