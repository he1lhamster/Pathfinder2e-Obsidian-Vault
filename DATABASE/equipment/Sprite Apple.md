A sparkling candy coating covers a sprite apple. For 10 minutes after consuming a sprite apple, you shed bright light in a 20-foot emanation (and dim light for the next 20 feet). While shedding this light, you can't be [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] if you're visible, and if you're [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], you're concealed instead rather than being [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]]. The light matches the vibrant color of the apple's candy coating. Creatures in the bright light are subject to another effect, depending on the type of apple.
