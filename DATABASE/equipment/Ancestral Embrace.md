This brightly colored _+4 [[DATABASE/equipment/Resilient|major resilient]] [[DATABASE/armor/Leather Armor|leather armor]]_ is inscribed with a spiral that has no end or beginning. Though it is a symbol of the ancient religion of Holy Xatramba, it also serves as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Religious Symbol|religious symbol]] of [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]]. When you invest the armor, you gain negative resistance 25 and can draw on the power of your ancestors. You gain an ancestry feat from your ancestry; the feat can be any level, but you must meet any other prerequisites of the feat. You lose the feat when the investment ends, and you can select a different feat each time you invest the armor again.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You use an ancestry feat that has a limited number of uses per day; **Effect** You gain an additional use of the ancestry feat. If you do not use it before the next time you make your daily preparations, the use is lost.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">4</span> envision **Trigger** You begin casting a [[DATABASE/ritual/Legend Lore|legend lore]] ritual to learn legends about your ancestry or about someone of your ancestry; **Effect** _Ancestral Embrace_ reduces the casting time of this ritual to 1 hour, and you don't need secondary casters for this ritual.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The armor casts [[DATABASE/spell/Avatar|avatar]], granting these specific additional abilities instead of those associated with a deity: Speed 70 feet, [[DATABASE/spell/Air Walk|air walk]], ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> spear (reach 15 feet, thrown 50 feet), **Damage** 6d6+6 piercing; **Ranged** <span class="action-icon">1</span> blowgun (range 120 feet), **Damage** 1d6+3 piercing plus 5d6 poison.
**Destruction** _Ancestral Embrace_ crumbles if its wearer intentionally and knowingly kills or desecrates the remains of six generations of their family.
