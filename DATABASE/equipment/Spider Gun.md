A _spider gun_ is a _+1 striking weapon_. It's a distinct type of martial firearm made from the fangs and spinneret of a Large spider. It deals 1d10 poison damage with a range increment of 30 feet and reload 1. On a critical hit, the venom clings to the target and they take [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent poison damage]] equal to 1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice. A spider gun does not add critical specialization effects. The gun can be activated to fire webbing that hampers other creatures.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Interact (conjuration, magical) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You fire a mass of webbing at a square within 30 feet. That square becomes covered in webbing for 1 minute. A square covered with the webbing from a _spider gun_ can be cleared by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. The first time each turn a creature in the webbing begins to use a move action or enters the webbing during a move action, it must attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check or Reflex save against DC 20. On a success, it moves normally through the webbing and clears away the webbing from any squares it enters this turn. On a failure, it treats squares of webbing as difficult terrain this turn, and on a critical failure, it's [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] for 1 round or until it [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]] (DC 20) or destroys the webbing.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials for the _spider gun_ must include the fangs and spinneret of a giant spider or other Large spider.
