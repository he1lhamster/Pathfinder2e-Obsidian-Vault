This snare forces air through several high-pitched, whistle-like pipes or reeds. The shrill noise can be heard clearly up to 2 miles away but is most intense near the snare's trigger. The snare deals 4d6 sonic damage (DC 22 basic Fortitude save) to creatures within 10 feet; a creature that fails this save is [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] for 1 round (1 hour on a critical failure). The triggering creature is deafened for 1 minute on a failure, or 1 hour on a critical failure.
