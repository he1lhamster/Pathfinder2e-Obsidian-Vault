This thick, greasy _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Shifting|shifting]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Whip|whip]]_ is made from a slimy pseudopod. You don't take the usual –2 circumstance penalty to your attack rolls when using the slime whip to make a lethal attack. The whip's form can be changed just like any weapon with the _shifting_ rune, but it reverts to its original form as soon as it isn't wielded. When in its whip form, you can use the following action.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> command, Interact **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** For 1 round, the slime whip deals acid damage rather than slashing damage. If the attack deals [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]], the persistent damage is also acid damage instead of its usual type.
