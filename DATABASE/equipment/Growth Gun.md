A _growth gun_ is a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Hand Cannon|hand cannon]]_ made from the regenerative flesh of a [[DATABASE/monster/Hydra|hydra]], [[DATABASE/monster/Troll|troll]], or other similar creature. It has an attached flesh sac that slowly replenishes one shot each round and can be loaded like a normal round of ammunition. It fires regenerating gobbets of flesh, bone, or teeth, determined by the damage type selected for its modular trait. A growth gun can be fired underwater, though it's still limited by the selected damage type as normal.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Interact (magical, transmutation) **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** Make a ranged Strike. On a hit, the creature becomes covered in a mass of flesh that continues to grow on the target for a brief time. The creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round, after which the growth withers and falls off.
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the flesh of a creature with [[DATABASE/monsterability/Regeneration|regeneration]].
