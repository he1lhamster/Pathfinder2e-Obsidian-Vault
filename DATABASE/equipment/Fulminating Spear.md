This _+1 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Spear]]_ is warm to the touch. The head of the spear is crafted from gold with ivory inlay and has a ruby set into the shaft. You can make the spear glow like a [[Torch]] or suppress its light by using an action, which has the concentrate trait.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You touch the ruby and hurl the spear at a square within 40 feet. When the spear lands, it detonates, dealing 6d6 fire damage (DC 23 basic Reflex save) to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation. It then flies back to your hand.
