This timeworn chalice is constructed of dull tin. It has an unassuming appearance save for the gold, silver, and ebony rings that encircle its rim.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">1</span> envision **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** The chalice fills with one of three different wines of your choosing, as described below. The wine looks, tastes, and smells the same regardless of which type you choose, and [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] has no effect on the liquid beyond indicating that it is magical.

* Ordinary wine. 
* Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 2nd-level [[DATABASE/spell/Restoration|restoration]] spell on the drinker. 
* Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Nightmare|nightmare]] spell on the drinker.

If you aren’t chaotic, the first time each day you activate the chalice, there is a one-in-six chance that the liquid you conjure is a different type (the GM should roll 1d6 as a secret roll) instead. The second and third times you activate the chalice in the same day, the odds of this happening increase to two-in-six or three-in-six, respectively. If you are chaotic, the chalice always works as intended.
