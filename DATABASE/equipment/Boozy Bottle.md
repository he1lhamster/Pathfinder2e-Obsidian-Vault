This tattoo depicts a container of alcohol, traditionally a small, uncorked brown bottle. You gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against poison.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> command **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You fail (but don't critically fail) an initial saving throw against a poison, or you gain [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent poison damage]]; **Effect** You pick your poison. Calling out the name of a drink as though ordering at a bar, you negate the triggering poison. Instead, you gain the [[DATABASE/equipment/Alcohol|alcohol]] affliction at stage 2. The DC of this magical alcohol is the DC of the triggering poison save or DC 20 for persistent poison damage.
