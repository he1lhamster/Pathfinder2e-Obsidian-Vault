_The Trader_ represents trades and exchanges of information. As long as you have _The Trader_ invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Gather Information|Gather Information]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> envision, Interact **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** _The Trader_ allows you to make an exchange with yourself. Press the card to your brow, and then select two skills. Your proficiency rank with those two skills swaps for 1 hour. For example, if you were a master in [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] and untrained in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]], you would become untrained in Athletics and a master in Crafting. If making this swap would break prerequisites to feats, you lose access to those feats until your skill proficiencies change back in an hour.
