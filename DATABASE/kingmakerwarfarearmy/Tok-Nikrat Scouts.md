**Scouting** +20 (+1 adjustment)

Capable of striding across water, these [[Bog Strider]] from the settlement of Tok-Nikrat (encounter area **HT12**) fight with nets and spears.
**AC** 31 (+1 adjustment); **Maneuver** +22 (high); **Morale** +18 (low, +2 adjustment)
**HP** 4 (RT 2)
**Melee** spears +23
**Ranged** net +23 (5 shots)
**Darkvision** (unique tactic)
 **Hurl Nets** (unique tactic) If the Tok-Nikrat Scouts hit an army with a net Strike, the army takes no damage. Instead, it increases its [[Mired]] condition value by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success). An army that is mired as a result of hurled nets can attempt to reduce the value of this mired condition (but not that caused by other sources) by attempting a Battle action against the Tok-Nikrat Scout's Maneuver DC. On a success, the army reduces their mired condition by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success), but on a critical failure, they increase the mired condition caused by the hurled nets by 1. Tok-Nikrat Scouts can't hurl nets at a target army that is [[Distant]].
 **Water Retreat** (unique tactic) If the battlefield features water terrain, Tok-Nikrat Scouts gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Maneuver checks made to Disengage.
 **Water Stride** (unique tactic) The Tok-Nikrat Scouts stride over watery surfaces, and they ignore difficult terrain caused by water or swamps. They gain a +4 circumstance bonus on initiative checks in war encounters when the battlefield features either terrain.
