# Nomen Scouts<span class="item-type">Army 8</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Cavalry</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Scouting** +18 (+2 adjustment)
**Recruitment** 26 (+2 adjustment); **Consumption** -1, self-sufficient
This band of Nomen [[Centaur]] (encounter site **NH1**) fight with spears and longbows.
**AC** 27; **Maneuver** +14 (low, +1 adjustment); **Morale** +19 (high)
**HP** 4 (RT 0)
**Melee** spears +20
**Ranged** longbows +20 (5 shots)
**Brave** (unique tactic) Nomen scouts are extraordinarily fearless and do not possess a Rout Threshold, and gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Morale checks made to avoid rout from other sources.
 **Darkvision** (unique tactic)
 **Self-Sufficient** (unique tactic) Nomen scouts are adept at providing for themselves, and never count against the kingdom's consumption. Furthermore, they can provide for other armies, and as long as they are not defeated during a Kingdom turn's Upkeep phase, they reduce the kingdom's consumption value by 1.
 **Trample** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (unique tactic) Nomen Scouts can attempt to trample an [[Engaged]] enemy army by attempting a +20 melee Strike against the army's AC. On a hit, they inflict 1 point of damage (2 points on a critical hit) and automatically move away from the army—they are no longer engaged with that army.
