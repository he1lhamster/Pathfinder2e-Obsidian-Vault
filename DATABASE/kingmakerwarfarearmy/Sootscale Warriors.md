**Accustomed to Panic** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (unique tactic) **Trigger** The Sootscale Warriors' [[DATABASE/condition/Shaken|shaken]] condition increases while they are not [[DATABASE/condition/Routed|routed]]. **Effect** The Sootscales take comfort in their fear and channel the panic into energy. Rather than increase their shaken condition, they reduce their [[DATABASE/condition/Weary|weary]] condition value by 1. Additionally, when the Sootscales use the Disengage action, the result is improved one degree.
 **Darkvision** (unique tactic)
