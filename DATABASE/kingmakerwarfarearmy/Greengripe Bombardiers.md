**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Scouting** +13 (-2 adjustment)
**Recruitment** 28 (+5 adjustment); **Consumption** 2
Greengripe [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblins]] (encounter site **SH5**) have built a mobile platform outfitted with a catapult-like flinging arm that can throw flammable debris.
**AC** 23 (-2 adjusment); **Maneuver** +12 (low); **Morale** +18 (high)
**HP** 6 (RT 3)
**Melee** dogslicers and torches +19 ( +1 adjustment)
**Ranged** burning debris +18 (5 shots)
**Burning Weaponry** (unique tactic) Unlike basic siege engine armies, Greengripe Bombardiers can make melee Strikes while [[DATABASE/condition/Engaged|engaged]]. When a Greengripe Bombardier scores a critical success on a Strike while taking the Battle action against an army (but not against a fortification), the army struck must make a successful Maneuver check against the Greengripe Bombardiers' Maneuver DC or take one additional point of damage from the goblins' burning weaponry.
 **Darkvision** (unique tactic)
 **Explosive Defeat** (unique tactic) When the Greengripe Bombardiers are [[DATABASE/condition/Defeated|defeated]], their alchemical siege engine explodes. Any army [[DATABASE/condition/Engaged|engaged]] with the Greengripe Bombardiers must succeed at a Maneuver check against the Greengripe Bombardier's Maneuver DC or take 1 point of damage (2 points of damage on a critical failure). As long as the Greengripe Bombardiers aren't destroyed, their siege engine gear is rebuilt automatically once the army loses the defeated condition.
