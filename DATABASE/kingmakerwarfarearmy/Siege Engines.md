**Engines of War** Siege engines cannot be outfitted with gear. They cannot attack [[DATABASE/condition/Engaged|engaged]] armies. They are more difficult to destroy due to their higher hit points than other basic armies. A siege engine can attack and damage fortifications with its ranged attacks as part of the Battle or Overwhelming Bombardment actions.
