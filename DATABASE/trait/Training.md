# Training

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
A training weapon is designed to be used when training an animal to participate in combat by identifying the target for the animal to attack. Striking a creature with a training weapon gives your animal companion or your [[DATABASE/feat/Bonded Animal|bonded animal]] a +1 circumstance bonus to its next attack roll against that target.
