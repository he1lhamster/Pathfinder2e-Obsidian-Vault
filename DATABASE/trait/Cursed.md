# Cursed

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gamemastery Guide|Gamemastery Guide]]
 An item with this trait is cursed to cause trouble for its owner. A curse isn’t detected when the item is identified, though a critical success reveals both the presence and exact nature of the curse. Cursed items can’t be discarded once they’ve been triggered or invested the first time. The item can be removed only if the curse is removed.
