# Razing

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
Razing weapons are particularly good at damaging objects, structures, and vehicles. Whenever you deal damage to an object (including shields and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Animated Object|animated objects]]), structure, or vehicle with a razing weapon, the object takes an amount of additional damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.
