# Razing

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
Razing weapons are particularly good at damaging objects, structures, and vehicles. Whenever you deal damage to an object (including shields and [[Animated Object]]), structure, or vehicle with a razing weapon, the object takes an amount of additional damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.

## Weapons

[[Barricade Buster]], [[Bec de Corbin]], [[Breaching Pike]], [[Dwarven Dorn-Dergar]], [[Earthbreaker]], [[Phalanx Piercer]], [[Wrecker]]
