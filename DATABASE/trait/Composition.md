# Composition

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you usually use a type of [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]]. If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an auditory performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a visual one. The spell gains all the traits of the performance you used. You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately.
