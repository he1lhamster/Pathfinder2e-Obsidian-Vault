**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
Settlement events take place in a specific settlement. Skill checks to resolve these events receive item bonuses only from structures that are part of that settlement. Settlement events' effects may be enhanced or diminished if the site has (or lacks) specific features.
