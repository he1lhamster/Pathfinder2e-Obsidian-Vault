# Mutagen

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
An elixir with the mutagen trait temporarily transmogrifies the subject's body and alters its mind. A mutagen always conveys one or more beneficial effects paired with one or more detrimental effects. Mutagens are polymorph effects, meaning you can benefit from only one at a time.
