# Inhaled

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
An inhaled [[DATABASE/monsterability/Poison|poison]] is activated by unleashing it from its container. Once unleashed, the poison creates a cloud filling a 10-foot cube lasting for 1 minute or until a strong wind dissipates the cloud. Every creature entering this cloud is exposed to the poison and must attempt a saving throw against it; a creature aware of the poison before entering the cloud can use a single action to hold its breath and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving throw for 1 round.
