# Unarmed

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarmed]]. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage generally works like a free-hand weapon.
