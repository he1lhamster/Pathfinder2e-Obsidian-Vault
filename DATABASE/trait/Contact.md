# Contact

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
A contact [[DATABASE/monsterability/Poison|poison]] is activated by applying it to an item or directly onto a living creature's skin. The first creature to touch the affected item must attempt a saving throw against the poison; if the poison is applied directly, the creature must attempt a saving throw immediately when the poison touches its skin. Contact poisons are infeasible to apply to a creature via a weapon attack due to the logistics of delivering them without poisoning yourself. Typically, the onset time of a contact poison is 1 minute.
