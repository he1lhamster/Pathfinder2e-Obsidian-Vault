**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
An ingested [[DATABASE/monsterability/Poison|poison]] is activated by applying it to food or drink to be consumed by a living creature, or by placing it directly into a living creature's mouth. A creature attempts a saving throw against such a poison when it consumes the poison or the food or drink treated with the poison. The onset time of ingested poisons typically ranges anywhere from 1 minute to 1 day.
