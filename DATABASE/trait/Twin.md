# Twin

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
These weapons are used as a pair, complementing each other. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don’t need to have the same runes.

## Weapons

[[Butterfly Sword]], [[Buugeng]], [[Dandpatta]], [[Exquisite Sword Cane]], [[Exquisite Sword Cane Sheath]], [[Feng Huo Lun]], [[Fire Poi]], [[Hook Sword]], [[Sawtooth Saber]], [[Tonfa]]
