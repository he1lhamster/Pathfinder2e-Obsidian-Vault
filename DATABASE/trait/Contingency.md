# Contingency

**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
Spells with this trait grant you an action during the spell's effects, typically a reaction with a special trigger. They typically have a long duration, such as 24 hours. You can have only one spell with the contingency trait, or one [[Contingency]] spell, active at a time. If you cast another spell with the contingency trait or _contingency_, the newer casting supersedes the older.

## Spells

[[Instant Armor]], [[Life Connection]], [[Lucky Number]], [[Mind of Menace]], [[Ocular Overload]], [[Summoner's Precaution]]
