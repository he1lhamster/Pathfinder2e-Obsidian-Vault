# Ranged Trip

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
This weapon can be used to [[Trip]] with the [[Athletics]] skill at a distance up to the weapon's first range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn't deal any damage when used to Trip. This trait usually appears only on a thrown weapon.

## Weapons

[[Aklys]], [[Bola]], [[Flying Talon]], [[Wrecker]]
