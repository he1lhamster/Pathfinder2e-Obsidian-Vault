# Inscribed

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
The equipment, typically an armor or shield, has been treated so it can be inscribed with magical symbols using the same methods as [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Crafting]] a [[DATABASE/equipment/Scroll|scroll]]. Inscribed attire can hold one scroll inscribed on it. You need a free hand to Activate the scroll, but you don't need to Interact to draw it. You can also Activate the magic to erase the scroll the equipment currently contains. You can't inscribe a new scroll onto the equipment if a scroll is currently inscribed on it or if the equipment is [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]].
