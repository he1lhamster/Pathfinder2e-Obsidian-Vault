# Aeon

**Source** [[Bestiary]]
These monitors are the self-styled defenders of reality. Traditional aeons have dualistic natures and forms, and they hold a dichotomy of interests, though axiomites and inevitables do not. Aeons other than [[Axiomite]] and inevitables communicate via a strange telepathic hodgepodge of sensory sending called envisioning.
