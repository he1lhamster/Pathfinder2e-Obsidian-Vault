A vehicular weapon is attached to a vehicle or worn by a mount and can typically only be wielded by the driver of the vehicle or the mount's primary rider. The driver or rider can control a vehicular weapon with the same hands they use to steer the vehicle or guide the mount. A vehicular weapon can be [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarmed]] by knocking the controls (typically reins for a mount or a steering device for a vehicle) out of the wielder's hands.
