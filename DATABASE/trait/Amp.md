# Amp

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
An amp is a special thoughtform that modifies the properties of your psi cantrips. Psi cantrips each have their own amp, and feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps.
