# Kingdom

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
