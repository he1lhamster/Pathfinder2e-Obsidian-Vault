# Adjustment

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/The Mwangi Expanse|The Mwangi Expanse]] 
Items with this trait are intended to alter existing pieces of equipment, typically armors, shields, and weapons. The given item will note which type of equipment it modifies. An adjustment that modifies armor can't modify [[DATABASE/armor/Explorer's Clothing|explorer's clothing]]. A piece of equipment can only be affected by a single adjustment at a time. Unless otherwise noted, adding or removing an adjustment requires using a 10-minute activity and a [[DATABASE/equipment/Repair Kit|repair kit]].
