# Tandem

**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
Actions with this trait involve you and your eidolon acting in concert. You can't use a tandem action if either you or your eidolon can't act, if you haven't [[Manifest Eidolon]], or if you've Manifested your Eidolon in a way where it isn't a separate entity (such as with the [[Meld into Eidolon]] feat). Tandem actions often let both you and your eidolon take separate actions, but these must be actions taken separately by you and your eidolon; you can't use a tandem action to take another tandem action.
