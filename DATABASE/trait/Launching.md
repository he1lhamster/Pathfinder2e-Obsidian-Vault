# Launching

**Source** [[Treasure Vault]] 
A mechanism within this shield can shoot projectiles, causing the shield to also function as a ranged weapon. The trait lists the type of weapon, such as “launching dart.” Striking with the launcher requires the same number of hands as normal, except that the hand holding the shield counts toward this total, so a one-handed ranged weapon would require only one hand. Reloading takes the normal number of Interact actions, to a minimum of 1 action, and you can't use the hand holding your shield to reload.
