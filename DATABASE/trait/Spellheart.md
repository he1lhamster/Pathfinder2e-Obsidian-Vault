# Spellheart

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
Spellhearts are permanent items that work similarly to talismans. You affix a spellheart using the Affix a Spellheart activity, which is otherwise identical to [[DATABASE/action/Affix a Talisman|Affix a Talisman]]. The limit of one talisman per item remains—an item can have one spellheart or one talisman, not both. When casting a cantrip from a spellheart, you can use your own spell attack roll or spell DC if it's higher. Crafting a spellheart requires the spells the spellheart can cast. For example, a [[DATABASE/equipment/Five-Feather Wreath|major five-feather wreath]] requires [[DATABASE/spell/Air Walk|air walk]], [[DATABASE/spell/Gale Blast|gale blast]], and [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Wind|wall of wind]].
