# Harnessed

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
This shield features a special brace or opening designed to hold [[DATABASE/weapon/Lance|lances]] or other jousting weapons. Jousters often use these shields as a backup in narrow passages and other places where they're unable to ride a mount. You can Interact to lock a weapon with the jousting trait in place in the shield, enabling you to use two hands to wield the shield and weapon simultaneously. If you're not wielding the combined unit with both hands, you can use neither the weapon nor the shield.
 While you have the shield [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|raised]], you can gain the jousting benefit of a weapon as if you were mounted. Because a significant portion of the weapon needs to be braced behind the shield, the weapon's reach is reduced by 5 feet if it is greater than 5 feet.
