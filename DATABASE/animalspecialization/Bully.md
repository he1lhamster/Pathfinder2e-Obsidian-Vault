# Bully
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Your companion terrorizes foes with dominance displays and pushes them around the battlefield. Its proficiency ranks for [[Athletics]] and [[Intimidation]] increase to expert (or master if it was already expert from its type), its Strength modifier increases by 1, and its Charisma modifier increases by 3.
