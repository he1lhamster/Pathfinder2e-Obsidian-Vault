**Source** [[Legends]]
Your companion ignores natural difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from sediment or stone and can move across quicksand, mud, and similar surfaces as if they were solid. It gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws and DCs to prevent being [[Shove]] or [[Trip]]. Its Strength modifier increases by 1 and its proficiency for barding increases to expert. This specialization can only be selected by shaitan-touched companions.
