# Daredevil
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Your companion joins the fray with graceful leaps and dives. It gains the deny advantage ability, so it isn't [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]], [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]], or flanking creatures unless such a creature's level is greater than yours. Its proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] increases to master, and its Dexterity modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.
