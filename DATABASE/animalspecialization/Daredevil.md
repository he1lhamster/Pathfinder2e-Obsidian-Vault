# Daredevil
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Your companion joins the fray with graceful leaps and dives. It gains the deny advantage ability, so it isn't [[Flat-Footed]] to [[Hidden]], [[Undetected]], or flanking creatures unless such a creature's level is greater than yours. Its proficiency rank in [[Acrobatics]] increases to master, and its Dexterity modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.
