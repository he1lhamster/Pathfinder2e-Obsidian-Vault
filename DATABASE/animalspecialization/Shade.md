# Shade

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
**Access** [[Shadowcaster]]
Your companion's physical form is made, in whole or in part, of shadow. It gains [[Darkvision]], resistance 5 to all damage except force, and in areas of dim light or darkness, it can Step 10 feet instead of 5 feet. Its proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. 
 A [[Shadowcaster]] has access to this specialization.
_Nethys Note: The Shade animal companion specialization was affected by the __ that reduced the nimble animal companion's proficiency with unarmored defense._
