You use fast-talking, flattery, and a silver tongue to avoid danger and escape tricky situations. You might be a grifter or con artist, traveling from place to place with a new story or scheme. Your racket is also ideal for certain reputable professions, like barrister, diplomat, or politician.
 When you successfully [[DATABASE/action/Feint|Feint]], the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against melee attacks you attempt against it until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, the target is flat-footed against all melee attacks until the end of your next turn, not just yours.
 You’re trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]]. You can choose Charisma as your key ability score.
