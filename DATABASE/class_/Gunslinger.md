# Gunslinger

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
_While some fear projectile weapons, you savor the searing flash, wild kick, and cloying smoke that accompanies a gunshot, or snap of the cable and telltale thunk of your crossbow just before your bolt finds purchase. Ready to draw a bead on an enemy at every turn, you rely on your reflexes, steady hand, and knowledge of your weapons to riddle your foes with holes. _
**Key Ability: DEXTERITY**
At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity
**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier**
You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following key terms in a number of gunslinger abilities.
 Flourish: Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
 **Misfire**: Firearms that are improperly maintained or subjected to unusual strain can misfire. If you attempt to fire a firearm that was fired the previous day or earlier and hasn't been cleaned since, roll a DC 5 flat check before making your attack roll. If you fail this misfire check, the weapon misfires and jams. The attack is an automatic critical failure, and you must use an Interact action to clear the jam before the weapon can be reloaded and fired again. Once you've spent at least an hour cleaning a weapon, you don't need to roll for a misfire until the next day unless an effect says otherwise. You can clean multiple firearms during this hour, up to a reasonable limit as determined by the GM (typically no more than five).
 Some abilities cause a weapon to misfire as a part of their effects. If such a misfire happens as a result of an attack (due to an action that causes a misfire on a failed attack, for example), it retroactively makes the attack a critical failure.

## Interacting to Reload

The slinger's reload action from each gunslinger way, as well as many feats, give the ability to Interact to reload a weapon. This is enough to reload a weapon that takes 1 Interact action to reload, but only provides one of the Interact actions needed to reload a weapon with reload 2 or greater. As normal, you can provide the remaining Interact actions separately.

# Roleplaying the Gunslinger

## During Combat Encounters...

You strike from range with your firearms, seeking to defeat your opponents before they can pose a true threat. Depending on your choice of weapon, you might prefer to strike your opponent from a hidden position before they ever realize you're there, dash through a frenzied melee with pistols blazing, or glide effortlessly across the battlefield, waiting for the perfect moment to end the conflict with a single, well-placed shot.

## During Social Encounters...

You have a keen eye and can see things coming from farther than most. You might not be the life of the party, but your companions know to pay attention when your subtle nod or concerned grunt indicates that something's amiss.

## While Exploring...

You scout the group's position for incoming threats and help search for secret doors and hidden passages, keeping a weather eye out for unexpected threats.

## In Downtime...

You might craft ammunition or keep your complex weapons clean and maintained, and you might look for work that matches your unique talents, such as working as a blacksmith, engineer, or part of the local watch. You might wander from town to town, or stay put for a spell to enjoy the silence that lingers between gunfights.

## You Might...

* Seek out areas of great conflict where your unique choice of weaponry can help build your reputation.
* Explore new horizons, trusting your honed senses and deadly weapon to keep you safe.
* Demonstrate extensive knowledge about various types of guns and ammunition, along with curiosity about the latest in gun technology.

## Others Probably...

* Assume that since you know how your gun works, you must also understand how to resolve other mechanical challenges.
* Underestimate you at first glance, thinking you rely on your gun because you lack any other skills.
* Respect your eternal vigilance, unyielding grit, and excellent aim.

## Ancestry and Background

In addition to those from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Gunslinger's Way

All gunslingers have a particular way they follow, a combination of philosophy and combat style that defines both how they fight and the weapons they excel with. At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats.
 Gunslinger ways can be found here.

## Gunslinger Feats

At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a gunslinger class feat.

## Singular Expertise

You have particular expertise with guns and crossbows that grants you greater proficiency with them and the ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls with firearms and crossbows.
 This intense focus on firearms and crossbows prevents you from reaching the same heights with other weapons. Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with weapons other than firearms and crossbows can't be higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have gunslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you have gunslinging legend, the limit is master.

## Skill Feats<span class="item-type">Level 2</span>

At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

## General Feats<span class="item-type">Level 3</span>

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Skill Increases<span class="item-type">Level 3</span>

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.
 At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Stubborn<span class="item-type">Level 3</span>

You don't like being told what to do, and you don't give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Will save against an effect that would give you the [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]] condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save, the controlled condition ends, though any other effects remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn't allow you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.

## Ability Boosts<span class="item-type">Level 5</span>

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.

## Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type">Level 5</span>

In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
