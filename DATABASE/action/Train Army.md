You train an army in the use of a tactic. Choose one of the tactics from those listed starting on page 575, then attempt a [[Scholarship]] or [[Warfare]] check against the tactic's Training DC. If your army has already learned its maximum number of tactics, the newly learned tactic replaces a previously learned tactic of your choice.
**Critical Success** The army learns the tactic and then becomes [[Efficient]].
**Success** The army learns the tactic.
**Failure** The army fails to learn the tactic.
**Critical Failure** The army not only fails to learn the tactic but becomes frustrated and exhausted from the training; increase the army's [[Weary]] condition by 1.
