# Ultrasonic Scream <span class="action-icon">2</span>

**Source** [[Grand Bazaar]]

---
The moth flaps its wings and emits ultrasonic squeaks that scramble the senses of nearby creatures. Choose one creature within 30 feet of the moth. That creature must attempt a Fortitude save. This uses a trained DC using the moth's Constitution modifier or an expert DC if the moth is specialized.
**Success** The target treats all creatures as [[Concealed]] on its next attack before the start of your next turn.
**Failure** The target treats all creatures as concealed until the start of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is also [[Stunned]].
