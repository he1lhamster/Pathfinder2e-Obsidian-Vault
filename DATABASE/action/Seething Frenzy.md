Your eidolon's fury boils over into a reckless, out-of-control frenzy. While frenzied, your eidolon is affected by [[DATABASE/spell/Boost Eidolon|boost eidolon]] and gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level, but it takes a –2 penalty to AC. Your eidolon can't voluntarily end the frenzy or start another frenzy while in the frenzy. The frenzy lasts for 1 minute, after which it's fatigued for 1 minute and can't start another frenzy for 1 minute.
