The pangolin coils into a ball to defend itself. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. Any creature that hits the pangolin with a melee unarmed attack while it's in its Defensive Curl take 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed]] damage. The pangolin can't move, use its unarmed attacks, or take other actions that require it to use its limbs while in its Defensive Curl, but it can unfurl as a single action, ending the effects of Defensive Curl.
