You spend an hour concealing the camp from potential threats by covering tents with branches, ensuring campfire placement minimizes the spread of scent or smoke, reminding others to avoid making too many loud noises, and so on. Attempt a Stealth check against the Zone DC. You can only attempt to Camouflage Campsite once per camping session, regardless of the activity's result.
**Critical Success** Your camouflage attempt exceeds expectation. Increase the Encounter DC for your camp by 2. The first time a flat check would result in an encounter during this camping session, instead treat that result as a failure with no encounter.
**Success** Your work helps hide your camp from detection. Increase the Encounter DC for your camp by 1.
**Critical Failure** You believe you've done well at your camouflage attempt but have actually forgotten something important or accidentally did something to make the campsite more noticeable. Decrease the Encounter DC for your camp by 2, and flat checks made to determine encounters result in a critical success on a roll of 19 or 20.
