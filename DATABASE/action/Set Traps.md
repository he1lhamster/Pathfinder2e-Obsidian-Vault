Nok-Nok sets several annoying and frustrating traps around the camp's perimeter. If the campsite is attacked by enemies during the next 24 hours, the invaders suffer a –1 item penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks on the first round of combat as they navigate the distracting traps. Any enemy whose initiative result is less than Nok-Nok's [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC is also [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] from the traps until the start of their turn on the second round of combat.
