You send your army around an enemy's flank to get a better attacking position and to push your enemy into disorder. Attempt a Maneuver check against the target army.
**Critical Success** The target army becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Outflanked|outflanked]] until the start of your next turn. You can choose to become [[DATABASE/condition/Engaged|engaged]] with that army or not.
**Success** The target army is outflanked until the start of your next turn. You are now engaged with that army.
**Critical Failure** You underestimate the target army's position, and the blunder causes your army to become outflanked until the start of your next turn.
