You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the right way. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can see and have been conversing with. Attempt a [[Diplomacy]] check against the creature's Will DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
**Critical Success** The target must directly answer your question. It doesn't have to answer truthfully, but you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Perception DC if the creature attempts to [[Lie]] to you.
**Success** As critical success, but the circumstance bonus is +2.
**Failure** The target can refuse to answer you as normal.
**Critical Failure** The target can refuse to answer you as normal, and its attitude toward you decreases by one step due to your aggravating attention.
