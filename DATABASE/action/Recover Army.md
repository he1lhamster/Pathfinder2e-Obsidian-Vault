When an army endures ill fortune, it can become afflicted by negative conditions. You can use the Recover Army activity to work at removing an affliction with a basic skill check (this DC increases by 5 if you are attempting to Recover from the defeated condition); the skill required for the check depends on the affliction.

## Recovering Army Conditions

| [[Defeated]]                                   | [[Politics]] (master) or <%%32%%>Warfare (expert)                       |

| [[Mired]] or [[Pinned]] | [[Engineering]] or [[Magic]] (expert)           |
| [[Shaken]]                                       | [[Arts]] or [[Warfare]] (expert)                     |

**Critical Success** You reduce the affliction's value by 2 (or in the case of a damaged army, increase its HP by 2 up to its maximum). If the affliction does not have a value, it is removed.
**Success** As critical success but you reduce the affliction's value by 1 (or in the case of a damaged army, increase its HP by 1 up to its maximum).
**Failure** You fail to remove the affliction.
**Critical Failure** You fail to remove the affliction and your soldier's lowered morale spreads discontent; increase Unrest by 1. If you were attempting to recover a defeated army, the army is destroyed.
