You use legendary Vudran techniques to craft a disharmonic instrument that incorporates pieces of [[DATABASE/monster/Kothogaz, Dance Of Disharmony|Kothogaz's]] heart. This is likely a tanpura, but legends mention other instruments and even voice enhancers. A disharmonic instrument is a [[DATABASE/equipment/Musical Instrument|virtuoso musical instrument]].
 This activity requires seven [[DATABASE/action/Harvest Heartsliver|disharmonic heartslivers]], the formula for a disharmonic instrument, 55,000 gp worth of rare materials, and 7 days of work. At the end of the 7 days, attempt a DC 40 Crafting check to [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]].
**Critical Success** You masterfully complete the disharmonic instrument. Holding the instrument grants immunity to Kothogaz's tympanic heartbeat and many-eyed blight.
**Success** You complete the disharmonic instrument.
**Failure** You don't complete the disharmonic instrument, and you contract [[DATABASE/monster/Kothogaz, Dance Of Disharmony|many-eyed blight]] from the heartslivers.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and whenever you're on the same plane as Kothogaz, it can immediately teleport to you with its Disharmonic Door ability.
