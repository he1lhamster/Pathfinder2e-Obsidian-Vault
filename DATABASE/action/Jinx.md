You can curse another creature with clumsiness. This curse has a range of 30 feet, and you must be able to see your target. The target gets a Will saving throw to resist this jinx, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
**Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Failure** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The target is clumsy 2 for 1 minute.
