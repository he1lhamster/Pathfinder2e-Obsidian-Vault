You free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects [[Grabbed]], [[Restrained]], [[Immobilized]], or [[Paralyzed]] them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to [[Escape]] from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn’t need to escape.
