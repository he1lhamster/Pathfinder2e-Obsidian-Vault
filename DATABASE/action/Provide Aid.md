You take 2 hours to aid another character in their Camping activity. When you Provide Aid, attempt a skill check of a type decided by the GM. The typical DC is 20, but the GM might adjust this DC for particularly hard or easy tasks. You can Provide Aid as many times as you want during a camping session, but remember that the circumstance bonuses granted by Provide Aid do not stack.
**Critical Success** You grant your ally a +2 circumstance bonus to the activity. If you're a master with the check you attempted, the bonus is +3, and if you're legendary, it's +4.
**Success** You grant your ally a +1 circumstance bonus to the activity's check.
**Critical Failure** Your ally takes a –1 circumstance penalty to their activity's check.
