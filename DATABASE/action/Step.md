**Requirements** Your Speed is at least 10 feet.

You carefully move 5 feet. Unlike most types of movement, Stepping doesn't trigger reactions, such as [[Attack of Opportunity]], that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square.
 You can't Step into difficult terrain, and you can't Step using a Speed other than your land Speed.
