_Nethys note: This camping activity requires that Kanerah is camping with the PCs (but see [[Learn from a Companion]])._
Kanerah expertly controls the campfire's exact temperature, making it easier to prepare meals. All cooking activities that take place for the remainder of the camping session gain a +1 circumstance bonus. This bonus increases to +2 if the PCs are at least 11th level.
