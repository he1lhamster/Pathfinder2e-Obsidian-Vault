Several of your thorns break off and hook into your attacker's body. You deal 1d8 piercing damage to the triggering creature. It attempts a basic Reflex save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. On a critical failure, the creature also takes 1d4 [[Persistent Damage]] as your thorns embed in its flesh.
 At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d8, and the persistent piercing damage increases by 1.
