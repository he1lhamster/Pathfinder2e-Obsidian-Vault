Stretching to extend its body to its limits, your eidolon attacks a foe that would normally be beyond its reach. Your eidolon makes a melee unarmed Strike, increasing its reach by 5 feet for that Strike. If the unarmed attack has the [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|disarm]], [[DATABASE/action/Shove|shove]], or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|trip]] trait, the eidolon can use the corresponding action instead of a Strike.
