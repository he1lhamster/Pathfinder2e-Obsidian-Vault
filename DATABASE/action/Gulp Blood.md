**Requirements** The water wraith's last action was a successful jaws attack against a foe.

The water wraith gains 2d8 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 round, and the foe takes 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]. If the water wraith has a specialization, the water wraith instead gains 3d8 temporary Hit Points, and the target takes 3d6 persistent bleed damage. If the targeted creature has absolutely no vital fluids, this ability might not function, at the GM's discretion.
