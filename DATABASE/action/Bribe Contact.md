<span class="item-trait">Downtime</span><span class="item-trait">Secret</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gamemastery Guide|Gamemastery Guide]]
**Cost** A bribe worth at least one-tenth of the Currency per Additional PC listed on Table 10–9: Party Treasure by Level. Doubling this amount grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.
**Requirements** You’ve successfully Gained a Contact (see below).

---
You offer a bribe to your contact to help the heist in some way. Attempt a hard or very hard Deception or Diplomacy check.
**Success** The contact accepts the bribe and you gain 1 EP.
**Failure** You believe you successfully Bribed your Contact and gained 1 EP, but in fact the contact informs the opposition of the attempted bribery, adding 1 AP to the infiltration. The GM can reveal that this Edge Point grants no benefit at any point during the infiltration, as befits the story.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but adding 2 AP to the infiltration.
