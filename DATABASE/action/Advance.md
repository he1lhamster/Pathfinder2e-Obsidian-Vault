Your army attempts to close the distance with a target enemy army it is not engaged with by attempting a Maneuver check.
**Critical Success** The enemy army becomes [[Engaged]] with your army, even if it previously had the [[Distant]] condition (in which case it loses that condition and becomes engaged).
**Success** If the target army is distant, it loses that condition; otherwise, it becomes engaged.
**Failure** Your army's attempt to advance fails.
**Critical Failure** Your army's attempt to advance fails, and it becomes disorganized, becoming mired 1 until the start of its next turn.
