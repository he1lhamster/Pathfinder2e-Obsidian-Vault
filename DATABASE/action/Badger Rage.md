**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Requirements** The badger isn’t [[Fatigued]] or raging.

---
The badger enters a state of pure rage that lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies it can perceive, or until it falls [[Unconscious]], whichever comes first. It can’t voluntarily stop raging. While raging, the badger is affected in the following ways.

* It deals 4 additional damage with its bite attacks and 2 additional damage with its claw attacks. 
* It takes a –1 penalty to AC. 
* It can’t use actions that have the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. The animal companion can [[Seek]] even while raging.

After it has stopped raging, it can’t use Badger Rage again for 1 minute.
