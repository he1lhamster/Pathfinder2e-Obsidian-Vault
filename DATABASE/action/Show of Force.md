Using Regongar's advice, a public show of force is performed in an attempt to curtail criminal activity or subversive activity in the kingdom. Attempt a basic [[DATABASE/skill/Warfare|Warfare]] check to determine how effective the Show of Force is.
**Critical Success** The kingdom's criminals are cowed by the show of force. Reduce Crime by 2 and reduce one other Ruin of your choice by 1.
**Success** The kingdom's criminals take note of the show of force. Reduce Crime by 1.
**Failure** The show of force fails to impress criminals but unsettles the rest of the citizens. Increase Unrest by 1.
**Critical Failure** The criminals are emboldened by the failed show of force. Increase Unrest by 1d4 and Crime by 1.
