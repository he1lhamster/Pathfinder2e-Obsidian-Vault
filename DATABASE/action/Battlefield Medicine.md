Your army attempts to patch up an allied army's wounds during battle. Once you attempt this war action on an army, that army is temporarily immune to Battlefield Medicine for the remainder of the war encounter. Attempt a DC 25 Scouting check to successfully sort the army's wounded and provide swift aid.
**Critical Success** You restore 2 HP to the target army.
**Success** You restore 1 HP to the target army.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt to heal the army fails, and that army's [[Weary]] condition value increases by 1.
