As the party preps the campsite, Jaethal takes an hour to establish contact with the spirits of the dead who linger in the region, be they slain bandits, doomed adventurers, or even just wild animals who succumbed to the laws of nature. If the camp is attacked during the period of rest, these spirits of the dead rise up as undead guardians to defend Jaethal and her allies.
 These undead guardians manifest as shrieking ghostlike spirits. While their exact shape is determined by the GM, their effect in battle remains the same. Each round during combat, one PC can choose to be defended by the undead guardians (and gain a +1 status bonus to AC for 1 round) or to have them aid their attacks (and gain a +1 status bonus to all melee Strikes for 1 round).
