Your army uses trickery, deception, and unfair tactics to attempt a devastating attack against an outflanked army. Attempt a melee Strike or a ranged Strike against the AC of a target outflanked army that is not distant.
**Critical Success** The target army becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Weary|weary 2]] until the start of your next turn.
**Success** The target army becomes weary 1 until the start of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** Your attack deals no damage to the target army, which is emboldened by your failed attempt at dirty fighting. This reduces the target army's weary value by 1.
