The Ulgrem-Lurann bites down hard and unleashes an electrical discharge. It makes a jaws Strike. If the Strike hits, the target creature automatically becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] by the Ulgrem-Lurann and takes 1d4 electricity damage (2d4 for a mature Ulgrem-Lurann or 3d4 for a specialized companion). The grabbed condition lasts until the end of your next turn, though the Ulgrem-Lurann can use [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] to attempt to extend the duration as normal.
