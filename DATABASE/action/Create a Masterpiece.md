You encourage your kingdom's artists to create and display a masterful work of art to bolster your kingdom's reputation. Attempt a basic check; the result affects either Fame or Infamy (depending on the type of kingdom you're running). Create a Masterpiece may be attempted only once per Kingdom turn regardless of the number of leaders pursuing activities.
**Critical Success** Gain 1 Fame or Infamy point immediately, and at the start of your next Kingdom turn, gain 1 additional Fame or Infamy point. Immediately roll 2 Resource Dice. Gain RP equal to the result.
**Success** Gain 1 Fame or Infamy point immediately.
**Failure** Your attempt to create a masterpiece fails.
**Critical Failure** Not only does your attempt to create a masterpiece fail, it does so in a dramatic and humiliating way. Lose 1 Fame or Infamy point; if you have no Fame or Infamy points to lose, instead gain 1d4 Unrest.
