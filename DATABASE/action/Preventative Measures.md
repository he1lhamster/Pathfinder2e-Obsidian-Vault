_Nethys note: this activity requires that Tristian is the Magister and is at least [[Friendly]]_
Tristian helps to organize magical defenses and resources to combat potential upcoming disasters or dangers to the kingdom. Attempt a basic [[Magic]] check to determine how effective the magical preparations are.
**Critical Success** The next time during this Kingdom turn that you attempt a Kingdom skill check to resolve a dangerous event, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check and, unless you roll a critical failure, the result is improved one degree. If you reach the end of this Kingdom turn and haven't had a dangerous event, you may decrease one Ruin of your choice by 1.
**Success** The next time during this Kingdom turn that you attempt a Kingdom skill check to resolve a dangerous event, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.
**Critical Failure** The attempt to put preventative measures in place has resulted in significant waste of resources. You can't use Preventative Measures again on your next Kingdom turn, and when your next Kingdom turn begins, reduce your Resource Dice total by 2.
