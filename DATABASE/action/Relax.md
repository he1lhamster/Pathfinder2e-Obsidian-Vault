You spend 2 hours listening to campfire stories, chatting, reading, meditating, napping, or otherwise simply relaxing. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next check you make in order to resolve a Camping activity, provided that check happens during this camping session.
 A character that's suffering a status penalty from a critical failure on the [[DATABASE/action/Tell Campfire Story|Tell Campfire Story]] activity removes that penalty after spending an hour Relaxing. You can Relax as many times as you want during a camping session.
