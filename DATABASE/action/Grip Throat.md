The hand attempts to [[Grapple]] a Medium or smaller creature by the throat. If the Grapple succeeds, in addition to the normal effects, the creature has difficulty speaking. While it remains [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] by the hand, it must spend an extra action to perform any action that has the verbal trait.
