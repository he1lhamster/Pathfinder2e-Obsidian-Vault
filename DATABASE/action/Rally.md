You spend 1 minute encouraging your ally. Though this action typically has the auditory and linguistic traits, if you’re using the Performance skill, the GM might adjust the traits for this action to match the traits for your type of performance.
 Attempt a DC 15 skill check. The GM might adjust this DC based on the circumstances, such as attempting to Rally an ally who just suffered a humiliating defeat.
**Critical Success** The ally can spend 1 Resolve Point to regain all their Stamina Points.
**Success** You can continue encouraging your ally for a total of 10 minutes. If you do, they can spend 1 Resolve Point to regain all their Stamina Points.
**Critical Failure** The ally takes 1d8 mental damage, but this can reduce only Stamina Points, never Hit Points.
