Your foe hesitates under the weight of sin as visions of redemption play in their mind’s eye. The foe must choose one of the following options:

* The ally is unharmed by the triggering damage. 
* The ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. After the damaging effect is applied, the enemy becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] until the end of its next turn.
