The skeletal constrictor deals 12 piercing damage to the grabbed creature with its sharp ribs; the creature must attempt a basic Fortitude save. If the constrictor is a specialized companion, increase this damage to 20. This uses a trained DC using the constrictor's Constitution modifier, or an expert DC if the constrictor is specialized.
