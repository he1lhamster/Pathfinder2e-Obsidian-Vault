Your flights of imagination spill into the real world, causing you to become indistinct, hazy, or cloaked in figments. You become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] until the start of your next turn. This concealment can't be used to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]], as normal for concealing effects that leave your location obvious.
