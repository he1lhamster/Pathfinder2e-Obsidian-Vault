Your army attempts to frighten and cow an enemy army. Attempt a Morale check against the target army.
**Critical Success** The target army becomes [[Shaken]] until the start of your next turn.
**Success** The target army becomes shaken 1 until the start of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** Your failed attempt bolsters the enemy's spirits. This reduces the target army's shaken value by 1.
