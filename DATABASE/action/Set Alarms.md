Octavia places magical alarms at key places along the campsite's perimeter in order to catch ambushers before they can spring their attack on sleeping PCs. The first time the campsite is attacked by enemies during the next 24 hours, the alarms trigger and alert the PCs. Sleeping characters do not take the normal –4 status penalty when rolling initiative during such an attack, while characters who are awake gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative check.
