The zombie mount Strides twice, spraying putrid spittle as it runs. Once during this movement, choose a creature adjacent to the zombie mount. The spittle splashes on it, and the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. The creature is then temporarily immune to the spittle for 24 hours. This uses a trained DC using the zombie mount's Constitution modifier, or an expert DC if the mount is specialized.
