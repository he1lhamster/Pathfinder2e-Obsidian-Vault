Your eidolon rips off a chunk of elemental matter from their own form and hurls it into a group of foes. Your eidolon loses a number of Hit Points equal to your level. All creatures in a 20-foot burst within 60 feet take 6d6 damage with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. The damage increases by 1d6 for each level you have beyond 7th. The damage's type is either fire damage if your eidolon is a fire elemental, or the same physical damage type as your eidolon's primary unarmed attack if your eidolon isn't a fire elemental. Elemental Burst gains any traits that your eidolon's unarmed attacks gain from elemental core.
