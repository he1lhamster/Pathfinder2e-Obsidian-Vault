Kalikke infuses water in the environment near the campsite with latent magical qualities that bolster the campsite's defenses. If the campsite is attacked by enemies during the next 24 hours, the attackers suffer a –2 circumstance penalty to Initiative checks as they're forced to deal with unexpectedly deep puddles, sudden currents in standing water, or thick patches of muddy earth. This penalty increases to –3 once the party reaches 11th level.
