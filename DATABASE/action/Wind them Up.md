Should foes parry your blade or dodge your bullets? Neither— they should be watching their purse. Make a melee Strike with your combination weapon, and then attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check with a –5 penalty to [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]] from your target; you can't Steal closely guarded objects or objects that would take a long time to pilfer. You don't need a free hand to attempt to Steal something in this manner. If your Thievery check succeeds, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against your ranged attacks until the start of your next turn, and you don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement or a ranged attack. These effects occur even if your target has no objects to Steal.
