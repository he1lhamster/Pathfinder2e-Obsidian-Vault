You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a [[Disguise Kit]], but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.
 In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your deception only if they use the [[Seek]] action to attempt Perception checks against your [[Deception]] DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature’s Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception check even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.
**Success** You trick the creature into thinking you’re the person you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check if your behavior changes.
**Failure** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be.
**Critical Failure** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without a disguise.
