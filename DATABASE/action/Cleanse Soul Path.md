You meditate, pray, or otherwise try to reinforce your soul's connection to your soulforged armament. This takes 10 minutes. Attempt a counteract check against your soulforged corruption. The counteract level is half your level rounded up, and the counteract check modifier is your [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] modifier. If successful, reduce the stage of your _soulforged corruption_ by 1 (to a minimum of Stage 1).
