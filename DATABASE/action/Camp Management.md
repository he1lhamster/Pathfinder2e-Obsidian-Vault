Jubilost helps organize Camping activities to be more efficient, allowing the campers to attempt additional Camping activities during the camping session. Jubilost attempts a [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] check against the Zone DC to determine how helpful his management is.
**Critical Success** Jubilost's advice speeds things along significantly. During the hour immediately following this critical success, each PC may attempt two Camping activities instead of one. This success does not increase the number of activities companions may attempt.
**Success** As critical success, but only one PC may attempt two Camping activities during the next hour.
**Critical Failure** Jubilost's advice backfires, resulting in inefficiencies during the rest of the camping session. All checks made to resolve Camping activities take a –2 circumstance penalty for the remainder of this camping session.
