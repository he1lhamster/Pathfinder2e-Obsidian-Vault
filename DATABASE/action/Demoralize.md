With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting putdown, you can shake an enemy's resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you're aware of. Attempt an [[Intimidation]] check against that target's Will DC. If the target does not understand the language you are speaking, or you're not speaking a language, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10 minutes.
**Critical Success** The target becomes frightened 2.
**Success** The target becomes frightened 1.
