Valerie spends her time in camp maintaining the group's armor and potentially repairing [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]] shields. One PC chooses one suit of armor or a broken shield. If the PC chooses a suit of armor, that suit of armor grants the wearer temporary Hit Points equal to half their level during the next encounter it's worn; these temporary Hit Points expire at the end of the encounter or after 24 hours. If the PC chooses a broken shield, Valerie restores the broken shield to full HP. An additional PC can choose a suit of armor or broken shield once the party is 3rd level, and then again every 2 levels thereafter.
