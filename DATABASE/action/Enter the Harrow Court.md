You concentrate on a card from the _Deck of Destiny_ that you have invested, focusing on it as if you were looking through a window rather than at a piece of artwork. After 1 minute, a stationary portal appears in the air in front of you, its edges resembling the quick riffling of a thick deck of cards. You and any other creatures you designate can pass through this portal to enter [[The Harrow Court]], arriving in a fortress at the center of the demiplane known as the Harrowheart. (As you continue to epitomize more cards within the Harrow Court, you unlock new areas into which you can potentially arrive as well—but in this adventure, that ability won't yet be granted.) Once created, the portal persists for up to 1 minute or until you take an action with the envision trait to close the portal.
 A character in the Harrow Court can use this activity to open a portal out of the demiplane, but this portal always leads to the same point in the multiverse they were at when they previously entered the Harrow Court (unless certain cards have been epitomized to allow more options).
