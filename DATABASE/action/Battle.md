Your army attacks an enemy army with a Strike against the enemy army's AC. You can do so with a melee Strike only if you are [[Engaged]] with the target army. Otherwise, you must use a ranged Strike. An army can attempt a maximum of 5 ranged Strikes per war encounter (unless it has the [[Increased Ammunition]] tactic). As with any attack, multiple Strikes in a single round suffer a multiple attack penalty.
 A siege engine can use the Battle action to attack and damage a fortification.
**Critical Success** You deal 2 points of damage to the army.
**Success** You deal 1 point of damage to the army.
