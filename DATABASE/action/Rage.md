You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging:

* You deal 2 additional damage with melee Strikes. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile. 
* You take a –1 penalty to AC. 
* You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] while raging.

After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute.
