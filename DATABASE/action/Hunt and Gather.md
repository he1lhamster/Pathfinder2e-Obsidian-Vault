You spend 2 hours gathering ingredients. This supplements the food from [[DATABASE/action/Subsist|Subsisting]] with additional ingredients you can use to cook basic or special meals, gaining greater effects than simply eating the rations alone. Attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Hunting Lore]] or Survival check against the Zone DC.
**Critical Success** You find a number of basic ingredients equal to twice the zone's DC, plus 4 special ingredients. If you're Hunting and Gathering in a zone that's at least level 7, increase the number of special ingredients found to 8; if you're doing so in a zone that's at least level 14, increase it to 12.
**Success** You find a number of basic ingredients equal to the zone's DC, plus 1d4 special ingredients. If you're Hunting and Gathering in a zone that's at least level 7, increase the number of special ingredients found to 2d4; if you're doing so in a zone that's at least level 14, increase it to 3d4.
**Failure** You find a number of basic ingredients equal to the zone's DC.
**Critical Failure** You find 1d4 basic ingredients (maximum equal to the zone's DC). In addition, you've attracted attention. Make an additional flat check to determine if a random encounter occurs at your campsite following this activity.
