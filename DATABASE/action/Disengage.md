Your army attempts to disengage from enemy armies to put some distance between itself and the enemy. Attempt a Maneuver check against each army your army is engaged with.
**Critical Success** Your army is no longer [[Engaged]] with the target army. In addition, your army is automatically no longer engaged with any armies you haven't yet rolled a Maneuver check against during this war action.
**Success** Your army breaks free and is no longer engaged with the target army.
**Failure** Your army remains engaged with the target army.
**Critical Failure** Your army remains engaged with the target army and, for the remainder of this turn, your army cannot attempt to disengage from any army with which it is still engaged.
