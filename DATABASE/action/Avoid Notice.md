You attempt a Stealth check to avoid notice while traveling at half speed. If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Swift Sneak|Swift Sneak]] feat, you can move at full Speed rather than half, but you still can’t use another exploration activity while you do so. If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Legendary Sneak|Legendary Sneak]] feat, you can move at full Speed and use a second exploration activity. If you’re Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you (based on their Perception DCs, as normal for Sneak, regardless of their initiative check results).
