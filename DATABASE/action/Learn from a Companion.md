All of the companions in this book are presented with specialized Camping activities. Normally, in order for a PC to be able to attempt one of these specialized activities, that companion must be present in the camp as well, but this activity allows the companion to attempt to teach the party how to perform the activity on their own. You spend 2 hours with the companion when you attempt to learn from them, then attempt a DC 20 Perception check.

**Critical Success** You learn the companion's special activity. Any PC who meets that activity's requirements (see table above) can now perform that activity even when the companion isn't in the camp.
**Success** You make progress in learning the special activity but require at least one more day to master it. If you attempt to Learn from this Companion the next time you camp, the result of that check is improved by one degree of success from the result rolled.
**Failure** You fail to learn anything from the companion.
**Critical Failure** You fail to learn from the companion, who grows frustrated with the party. No further attempts to Learn from this Companion can be attempted during this camping session.
