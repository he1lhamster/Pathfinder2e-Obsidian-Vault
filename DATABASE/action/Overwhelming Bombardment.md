Your siege engines focus all their fire on a fortification. This war action counts as using two ranged Strikes for the purposes of depleting an army's shots. Attempt a ranged Strike against the target fortification's AC.
**Critical Success** You deal 2 points of damage to the fortification. You also deal 1 point of damage to up to two armies of your choice that are within the fortification.
**Success** You deal 1 point of damage to the fortification, and an additional 1 point of damage either to the fortification or to an army within the fortification (your choice of which).
**Failure** You deal 1 damage to the fortification.
**Critical Failure** You deal no damage, and your army becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Outflanked|outflanked]] until the start of its next turn.
