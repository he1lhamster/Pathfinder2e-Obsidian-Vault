Your implement sings out abruptly, disrupting your foe. The piece played depends on whether the trigger was a Strike or Spell, and it applies to the triggering Strike or Spell, except where noted otherwise.

* **Distracting Cacophony** The trigger is a spell. You create a musical crash of sonic energy that assails the target and breaks its concentration. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn (stupefied 2 on a critical failure). The target doesn't have to attempt a flat check to avoid losing the triggering spell, but the discordant ring does lower the spell attack roll or spell DC of the triggering spell from stupefied.
* **Disrupting Harmony** The trigger is a Strike. You create a strangely discordant harmony that sinks into your foe's mind and throws its movements off. The target must succeed at a Will save against your class DC or become your choice of [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] until the end of your next turn (enfeebled 2 or clumsy 2 on a critical failure).
