You quickly brew up a short-lived tincture. You create a single alchemical elixir or tool of your level or lower without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the end of the current turn.
