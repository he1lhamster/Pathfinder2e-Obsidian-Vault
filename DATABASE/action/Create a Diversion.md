With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and linguistic traits. 
Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.
**Success** You become [[Hidden]] to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to [[Sneak]] away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the [[Hide]] or the Sneak action of the [[Stealth]] skill. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains [[Flat-Footed]] against that attack, and you then become [[Observed]]. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.
**Failure** You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.
