You try to make contact with an individual who can aid you in the infiltration. Attempt a normal, hard, or very hard DC Diplomacy or Society check, or a check using a Lore skill appropriate to your prospective contact. 
**Success** You make contact and gain 1 EP.
**Failure** You fail to make contact.
**Critical Failure** You insult or spook the contact in some way. Future attempts take a –2 circumstance penalty. **Special** Multiple critical failures might cause the contact to work against the PCs in some way, likely increasing the party’s Awareness Points.
