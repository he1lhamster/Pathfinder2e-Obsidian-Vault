Your careful shot against an unsuspecting opponent pierces a vital artery or organ. Make a ranged Strike. If the target is [[Flat-Footed]], the Strike deals an extra die of weapon damage, and the foe takes [[Persistent Damage]] equal to the amount of precision damage from your [[One Shot, One Kill]].
