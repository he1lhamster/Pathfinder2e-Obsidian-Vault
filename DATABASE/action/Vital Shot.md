Your careful shot against an unsuspecting opponent pierces a vital artery or organ. Make a ranged Strike. If the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], the Strike deals an extra die of weapon damage, and the foe takes [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] equal to the amount of precision damage from your [[DATABASE/action/One Shot, One Kill|One Shot, One Kill]].
