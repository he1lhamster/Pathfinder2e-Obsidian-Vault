The elephant grabs its foe with its trunk and carries it off. The elephant uses [[Athletics]] to [[Grapple]] a creature up to two sizes smaller than the elephant in its trunk. If its target is [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]], the elephant repositions the target to another space in the elephant's reach.
