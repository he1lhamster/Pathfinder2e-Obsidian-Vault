The elephant grabs its foe with its trunk and carries it off. The elephant uses [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] a creature up to two sizes smaller than the elephant in its trunk. If its target is [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], the elephant repositions the target to another space in the elephant's reach.
