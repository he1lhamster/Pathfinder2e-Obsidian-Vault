[[DATABASE/deity/Urgathoa|Urgathoa]] is more than just the goddess of undeath— she's also the goddess of gluttony. And Jaethal is no fool; she understands the fear her goddess inspires in the living and knows that focusing on other aspects of her worship are more likely to result in positive growth for the nation. In order to distract the populace, she arranges for decadent feasts for the people, simultaneously feeding the hungry while camouflaging some of her faith's more sinister aspects. Spend 1d8 Food commodities and 1 Luxury commodity, then attempt a basic [[DATABASE/skill/Agriculture|Agriculture]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Trade|Trade]] check to determine how effective the feasts are.
**Critical Success** The people rejoice and glut themselves on the repast! Reduce Unrest by 1d6, and the next time this Kingdom turn you suffer an effect that increases Unrest, do not increase your Unrest.
**Success** The people enjoy the meal, but no longer than it takes to gulp it down. Reduce Unrest by 1d3.
**Failure** The meal is appreciated, but the people remain suspicious. Reduce Unrest by 1.
**Critical Failure** The people are too suspicious of the feast to enjoy it. Worse, rumors that Jaethal is trying to distract the citizens from an evil ritual spread. Increase Unrest by 1d4 and increase Corruption by 1.
