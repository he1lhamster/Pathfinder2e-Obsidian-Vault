While the PCs can strike out themselves to deal with ongoing events, it's often more efficient to Hire Adventurers. When you Hire Adventurers to help end an ongoing event, the DC is equal to your Control DC adjusted by the event's level modifier. Roll 1 Resource Die and spend RP equal to the result each time you attempt this activity.
**Critical Success** You end the continuous event.
**Success** The continuous event doesn't end, but you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to resolve the event during the next Event phase.
**Failure** You fail to end the continuous event. If you try to end the continuous event again, the cost in RP increases to 2 Resource Dice.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but word spreads quickly through the region—you can no longer attempt to end this continuous event by Hiring Adventurers.
