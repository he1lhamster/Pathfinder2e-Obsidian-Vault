_Nethys note: This camping activity requires that Tristian is camping with the PCs (but see [[Learn from a Companion]])._
Tristian's prayers to [[Sarenrae]] invoke her healing blessing on the party, imparting feelings of comfort and security to everyone who's part of the campsite. When the party rests during this camp, each character regains twice the normal amount of Hit Points from the rest (an amount equal to double their Constitution modifier—minimum 2—multiplied by their level). The effect isn't cumulative with the critical success effect of a [[Cook Basic Meal]].
