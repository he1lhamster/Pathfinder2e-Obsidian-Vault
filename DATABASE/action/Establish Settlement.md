You draw up plans, gather resources, entice citizens, and establish boundaries to found a brand new settlement in the hex. Attempt a basic Engineering, Industry, Politics, or Scholarship check. If you cannot pay the RP required by the result of this check, treat your result as a critical failure. A settlement always starts as a village. See page 540 for further details about building settlements.
**Critical Success** You establish the settlement largely with the aid of enthusiastic volunteers. Spend 1d6 RP.
**Success** You establish the settlement. Spend 3d6 RP.
**Failure** You establish the settlement, but inefficiently and at great expense. Spend 6d6 RP.
**Critical Failure** You fail to establish the settlement.
