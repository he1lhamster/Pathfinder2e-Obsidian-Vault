Your metal elemental surrounds itself with protective metal spikes, hunkering down defensively. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. Any creature that hits the metal elemental with a melee unarmed attack while it's in its Spiked Bunker takes 2d6 piercing damage (or 3d6 piercing damage if your metal elemental has a specialization). The metal elemental can't move, Strike, or take other actions that require it to use its body while in its Spiked Bunker, but it can retract the bunker as a single action, ending the effects.
