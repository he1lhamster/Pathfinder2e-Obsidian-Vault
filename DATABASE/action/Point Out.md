You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. That creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to your allies, rather than [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]]. This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target. If your allies can't hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature's [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.
