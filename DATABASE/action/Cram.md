Realizing that you're falling behind in your studies, you cram more than you probably should. You [[Study]] twice, each in a branch that satisfies the activity requirements. However, the extra studying comes at a price. Until the next time you take the Study downtime activity, you're particularly tired from all the extra hours cramming; at the start of each day of adventuring, you must succeed at a DC 8 flat check or be [[Fatigued]] for that day.
