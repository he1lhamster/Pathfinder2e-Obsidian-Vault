You attempt to escape from being [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]]. Choose one creature, object, spell effect, hazard, or other impediment imposing any of those conditions on you. Attempt a check using your unarmed attack modifier against the DC of the effect. This is typically the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] DC of a creature grabbing you, the [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC of a creature who tied you up, the spell DC for a spell effect, or the listed Escape DC of an object, hazard, or other impediment. You can attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or Athletics check instead of using your attack modifier if you choose (but this action still has the attack trait).
**Critical Success** You get free and remove the grabbed, immobilized, and restrained conditions imposed by your chosen target. You can then Stride up to 5 feet.
**Success** You get free and remove the grabbed, immobilized, and restrained conditions imposed by your chosen target.
**Critical Failure** You don’t get free, and you can’t attempt to Escape again until your next turn.
