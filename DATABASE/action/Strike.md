**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Frequency** once per day
**Requirements** The _Lady's chalice_ is full of a vial's worth of _holy water_

The chalice splashes a spiral of _holy water_ into an adjacent space. This is a simple thrown weapon with a range of 5 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. If it hits, it deals 2d6 good damage and 2 good splash damage (including to you, if you're evil).
