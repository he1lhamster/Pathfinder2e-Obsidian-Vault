You attempt to grab a creature or object with your free hand. Attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the target's Fortitude DC. You can Grapple a target you already have grabbed or restrained without having a hand free.
**Critical Success** Your target is restrained until the end of your next turn unless you move or your target [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]].
**Success** Your target is grabbed until the end of your next turn unless you move or your target Escapes.
**Failure** You fail to grab your target. If you already had the target grabbed or restrained using a Grapple, those conditions on that creature or object end.
**Critical Failure** If you already had the target grabbed or restrained, it breaks free. Your target can either grab you, as if it succeeded at using the Grapple action against you, or force you to fall and land [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
