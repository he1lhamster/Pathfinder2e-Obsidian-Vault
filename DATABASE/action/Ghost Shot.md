Make a firearm or crossbow Strike. If you're [[Hidden]] from or [[Undetected]] by the target, the Strike adds the additional precision damage from [[One Shot, One Kill]]; if you would already receive that additional damage on the Strike, the effects aren't cumulative. If you were undetected or [[Unnoticed]] by any creatures, you're now hidden from them instead, as the origin of the attack is clear.
