Make a firearm or crossbow Strike. If you're [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from or [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] by the target, the Strike adds the additional precision damage from [[DATABASE/action/One Shot, One Kill|One Shot, One Kill]]; if you would already receive that additional damage on the Strike, the effects aren't cumulative. If you were undetected or [[DATABASE/condition/Unnoticed|unnoticed]] by any creatures, you're now hidden from them instead, as the origin of the attack is clear.
