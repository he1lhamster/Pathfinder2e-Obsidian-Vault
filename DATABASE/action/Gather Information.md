You canvass local markets, taverns, and gathering places in an attempt to learn about a specific individual or topic. The GM determines the DC of the check and the amount of time it takes (typically 2 hours, but sometimes more), along with any benefit you might be able to gain by spending coin on bribes, drinks, or gifts.
**Success** You collect information about the individual or topic. The GM determines the specifics.
**Critical Failure** You collect incorrect information about the individual or topic.
