The scorpion holds its foe in place with its pincers in order to sting it. It makes a pincer Strike. If the Strike hits, the target creature automatically becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] by the scorpion, which then makes a stinger Strike against it. The grabbed condition lasts until the end of your next turn.
