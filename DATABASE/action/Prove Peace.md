You touch the siege shard, establish a mental connection, and relay facts of the conflict's resolution. Attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] about the conflict that created the shard, using the siege shard's Will DC. If you succeed, you prove the conflict's end, and the siege shard reverts to ordinary stone. On a critical failure, images of the past conflict overwhelm you, and you are [[Confused]] until the end of your next turn.
