Your ape makes a loud and frightening display, throwing a foe off balance. The ape attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the target creature; this display gains the visual trait and doesn't require language. While frightened by this ability, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to your ape.
