Amiri spends her time in camp sharpening the group's weapons, bolstering grips and handles, or festooning blunt weapons with temporary stone weights designed to maximize damage. Each PC chooses one melee weapon. That melee weapon gains a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls during the next encounter it's used in; this bonus expires at the end of that encounter or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.
