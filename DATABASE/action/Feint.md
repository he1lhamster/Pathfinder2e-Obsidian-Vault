Your army launches a probing attack meant to trick the enemy into thinking you are attacking from one quarter while your real thrust comes elsewhere.
**Critical Success** The target army's defenses are thrown off; it is [[Outflanked]] until the end of your turn.
**Success** The target army is fooled, but only momentarily. It is outflanked against the next melee Strike your army attempts against it before the end of your current turn.
**Critical Failure** The enemy anticipates your feint and presses the advantage. You are outflanked by the target army until the end of your next turn.
