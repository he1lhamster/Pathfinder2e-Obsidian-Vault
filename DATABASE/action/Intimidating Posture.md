The camp's intimidating nature scares off less powerful encounters. If a Low or Trivial random encounter is rolled at any point during the camp, treat it as no encounter instead. The PCs still earn any XP they would have otherwise earned for defeating the encounter in combat when they wake the next day and notice the telltale signs of flight from the skipped encounter.
