Following Ekundayo's advice, rural-dwelling citizens work to supplement stores of food and resources through hunting and trapping. Attempt a basic [[DATABASE/skill/Wilderness|Wilderness]] check to gather excess livestock from the local wildlife, ranches, and farms to generate food commodities.
**Critical Success** Gain 1d4 Food commodities, 1 Luxury commodity, and 1 bonus Resource Die at the start of your next Kingdom turn.
**Success** Choose only one of the three options from the above result.
**Failure** Your hunters and trappers fail to supplement your stores and must spend time resupplying and setting new traps; you cannot attempt Supplementary Hunting on the next Kingdom turn.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but your hunters and trappers have accidentally attracted the attention of dangerous wildlife. Either gain 1d4 Unrest or increase a Ruin of your choice by 1.
