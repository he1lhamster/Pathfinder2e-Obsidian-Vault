Harrim's prayers to [[DATABASE/deity/Groetus|Groetus]] bring an air of gloom and solitude over the party's campsite. While this causes the PCs to experience morose and somewhat unsettling dreams, it doesn't affect the quality of rest. It does, however, help to make the campsite less attractive to predators or wandering monsters. When checking for wandering encounters during the night (including when made as part of camping), the flat check DC for the encounter is increased by 2.
