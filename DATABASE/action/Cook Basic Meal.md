You spend 2 hours preparing a meal. Expend 2 basic ingredients per serving you wish to prepare, as well as 1 day's rations, or provisions from [[Subsist]], per serving.
 Once the party finishes all Camping activities and the characters have chosen which meals they wish to eat, attempt a DC 22 [[Survival]] check or a DC 18 [[Lore]] check to determine the effectiveness of your basic meal.
**Critical Success** You prepare a delicious meal. A character who eats this meal recovers Hit Points equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) multiplied by twice their level when they rest during this camping session instead of the normal amount, and they gain a +1 status bonus to all saving throws until they complete their daily preparations, or begin adventuring again.
