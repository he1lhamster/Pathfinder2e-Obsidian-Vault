The chalice fills with a single vial's worth of [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy Water|holy water]]. The water loses its potency after 1 day if poured into any container other than a font specifically sanctified by a cleric of Pharasma. It similarly loses its potency 1 day after being removed from such a font.
