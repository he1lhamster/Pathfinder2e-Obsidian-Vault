You press yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle to take better advantage of cover. If you would have standard cover, you instead gain greater cover, which provides a +4 circumstance bonus to AC; to Reflex saves against area effects; and to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]], [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]], or otherwise avoid detection. Otherwise, you gain the benefits of standard cover (a +2 circumstance bonus instead). This lasts until you move from your current space, use an attack action, become [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or end this effect as a free action.
