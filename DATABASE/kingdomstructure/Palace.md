A palace is a grand and splendid seat of government for your leaders and other political functionaries.

**Lots** 4; **Cost** 108 RP, 20 Lumber, 12 Luxuries, 15 Ore, 20 Stone
**Construction** [[DATABASE/skill/Defense|Defense]] (master), [[DATABASE/skill/Industry|Industry]] (master), [[DATABASE/skill/Magic|Magic]] (master), or [[DATABASE/skill/Statecraft|Statecraft]] (master) DC 34
**Upgrade From** [[DATABASE/kingdomstructure/Castle|Castle]]
**Item Bonus** +3 item bonus to New Leadership, [[DATABASE/action/Pledge of Fealty|Pledge of Fealty]], and [[DATABASE/action/Send Diplomatic Envoy|Send Diplomatic Envoy]], and +3 item bonus to Garrison Army, Recover Army, or Recruit Army (see Appendix 3: Warfare)
**Effects** A palace can only be built in your capital. The first time you build a palace, reduce Unrest by 10.
 If you [[DATABASE/equipment/Cat|Relocate your Capital]], a palace left behind in that capital instead functions as a noble villa that takes up 4 lots. (If you represent this by placing two noble villas in these lots, make sure to note that they constitute a single building and aren't two separate structures.) 
A palace in a capital allows PC leaders to take 3 Leadership activities during the Activity phase of a Kingdom turn rather than just 2. In addition, once your kingdom has a palace, a PC in the Ruler leadership role gains a +3 item bonus to checks made to resolve Leadership activities.
