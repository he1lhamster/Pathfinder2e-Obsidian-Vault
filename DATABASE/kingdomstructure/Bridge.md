Bridges give settlements that have water borders a connection to land (but at the GM's option, a border on a lake might not be able to use bridges).

**Effects** A bridge allows an island settlement to provide influence (see Influence), negates the Trade penalty for island settlements (see Land Borders), and allows travel over its associated Water Border with ease (see Navigating an Urban Grid). Bridges can only be built on Water Borders. When you build a bridge, check the “Bridge” box on one of the Water Borders on your Urban Grid to indicate its location.
