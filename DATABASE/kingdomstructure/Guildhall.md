A guildhall serves as the headquarters for a trade guild or similar organization. It includes offices for its leaders and functionaries as well as workshops for its craftspeople and a storefront for customers. Guildhalls always specialize in a certain type of trade or pursuit, but typically, only the largest cities have multiple guildhalls. Smaller settlements tend to focus on one particular trade.
