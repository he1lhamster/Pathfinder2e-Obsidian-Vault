**Effects** Giving the citizens a place to bury and remember their departed loved ones helps to temper Unrest gained from dangerous events. If you have at least one cemetery in a settlement, reduce Unrest gained from any dangerous settlement events in that particular settlement by 1 (to a maximum of 4 for four cemeteries). The presence of a cemetery provides additional effects during certain kingdom events.
