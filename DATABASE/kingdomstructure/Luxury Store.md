**Effects** A luxury store must be built on a block that has either a mansion or a noble villa. Treat the settlement's level as one level higher than its actual level for determining what luxury-themed magic items (subject to GM approval) are readily available for sale in that settlement. This effect stacks up to three times and overlaps with other stores that function in this way for more specific categories of magic items.
