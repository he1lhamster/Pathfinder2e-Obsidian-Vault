# Twisting Tree

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
The staff is perhaps one of the simplest of weapons, but this simplicity belies its elegance and versatility. To you, a staff is casting implement and martial weapon alike—the foundation of a fighting style.
 While you wield a staff in one hand, the staff adjusts in shape and weight, gaining the agile trait and increasing its damage die size to 1d6. While you wield a staff in both hands, it lengthens, twists, and reshapes, gaining the parry, reach, and trip traits. While you're in [[DATABASE/action/Arcane Cascade|Arcane Cascade]] stance, you can Interact or Release to change your grip on the weapon as a free action when you Strike with your staff, including Strikes made in a [[DATABASE/action/Spellstrike|Spellstrike]]. This happens before you roll your attack roll. You can also Interact to change your grip on the staff as a free action triggered at the end of your turn.
