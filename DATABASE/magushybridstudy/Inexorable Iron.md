Once you begin along a path, nothing can stop you from reaching its end. You transform the mass of a greataxe, greatsword, or polearm into an unstoppable force to augment your own striking power or keep you standing on the battlefield.
 When you enter [[DATABASE/action/Arcane Cascade|Arcane Cascade]] stance and at the start of each of your turns while you're in that stance, if you're wielding a melee weapon in two hands, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level (minimum 1 temporary HP).
