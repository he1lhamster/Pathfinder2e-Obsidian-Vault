**Blood Magic** The border between life and death becomes blurred to you. Either you gain a +2 status bonus to Fortitude saving throws for 1 round, or a target takes 1 damage per spell level. The damage is negative if the target is living or positive if the target is undead. If the spell already deals that type of damage, combine it with the spell's initial damage before determining weaknesses and resistances.
