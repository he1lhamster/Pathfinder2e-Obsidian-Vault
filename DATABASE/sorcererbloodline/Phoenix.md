You have been blessed by a phoenix, perhaps via some magical interaction with a similarly blessed individual.

**Spell List** primal
**Bloodline Skills** [[Diplomacy]], [[Nature]]
**Granted Spells** cantrip: [[Detect Magic]], 1st: [[Burning Hands]], 2nd: [[See Invisibility]], 3rd: [[Fireball]], 4th: [[Remove Curse]], 5th: [[Breath of Life]], 6th: [[Disintegrate]], 7th: [[Contingency]], 8th: [[Moment of Renewal]], 9th: [[Meteor Swarm]]

**Blood Magic** The primal fire of life and death flows through you or one target. Choose to have either you or a target of the spell gain temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's level for 1 round, or to have a target of the spell take fire damage equal to the spell's level (if the spell already deals initial fire damage, combine this with the spell's initial damage before determining weaknesses and resistances).
