# Wyrmblessed

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] 
You lay claim to the might of dragons, but your powers are sacred instead of arcane—born from a worship of draconic might so powerful it infused your blood or, perhaps, from a celestial or draconic power blessing one of your ancestors received.
**Spell List** divine
**Bloodline Skills** [[Intimidation]], [[Religion]]
**Granted Spells** cantrip: [[Read Aura]], 1st: [[Mage Armor]], 2nd: [[Resist Energy]], 3rd: [[Haste]], 4th: [[Reflective Scales]], 5th: [[Cloak of Colors]], 6th: [[Repulsion]], 7th: [[Mask of Terror]], 8th: [[Divine Inspiration]], 9th: [[Overwhelming Presence]]
**Bloodline Spells** initial: [[Dragon Claws]], advanced: [[Dragon Breath]], greater: [[Dragon Wings]]
**Blood Magic** Draconic might carries in your voice. Either you gain a +1 status bonus to [[Intimidation]] checks for 1 round, or a target takes a –1 status penalty to Will saves for 1 round.

## Dragon Type

At 1st level, choose the type of dragon that influenced your bloodline. You can't change your dragon type later. This choice affects how some of your bloodline spells function. The good metallic dragons and their damage types are [[Dragon, Brass]] (fire), [[Dragon, Bronze]] (electricity), [[Dragon, Copper]] (acid), [[Dragon, Gold]] (fire), and [[Dragon, Silver]] (cold). The evil chromatic dragons and their damage types are [[Dragon, Black]] (acid), [[Dragon, Blue]] (electricity), [[Dragon, Green]] (poison), [[Dragon, Red]] (fire), and [[Dragon, White]] (cold). The primal dragons of planar origin and their damage types are [[Dragon, Brine]] (acid), [[Dragon, Cloud]] (electricity), [[Dragon, Crystal]] (piercing), [[Dragon, Magma]] (fire), and [[Dragon, Umbral]] (negative). The imperial dragons and their damage types are [[Dragon, Forest]] (piercing), [[Dragon, Sea]] (bludgeoning), [[Dragon, Sky]] (electricity), [[Dragon, Sovereign]] (mental), and [[Dragon, Underworld]] (fire). For the [[Dragon Breath]] focus spell, the area is a 60-foot line for a brine dragon; a 30-foot cone for a cloud, crystal, forest, magma, sovereign, or umbral dragon; and a 10-foot burst within 30 feet for a sea, sky, or underworld dragon.
