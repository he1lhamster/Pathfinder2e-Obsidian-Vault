# Comozant Wyrd

Buzzing, crackling plasma makes up a comozant wyrd, electrically charged waves of greens, blues, and purples cascading in heatless flame. Given a mind and a semblance of a face, comozant wyrds need a surface from which they can crackle and writhe. Once secure, they seek out companionship from anyone nearby. In the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Universe]], they can be found in many places: lashing themselves to sailing ships, dancing across the buildings, or anchoring to the stones of a mountain range. In the vast spans of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], however, comozant wyrds often come to feel extremely lonely. A lucky few become pets for jaathooms living in the plane's cities, but many wait on isolated floating islands for an airship they can attach to or, more tragically, strive vainly to reach a distant shore before sputtering out.

**Plasmatic Form** Unlike other incorporeal creatures, a comozant wyrd can't move into or through solid objects. If a comozant wyrd isn't adjacent to a solid object or surface of its size or larger at the end of its turn, it loses 10 HP. This HP loss cannot be mitigated or avoided in any way.

Heatless flames similar to the wyrd's own surround any creature in the emanation. A visible creature can't become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] while in the emanation, and an [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] creature becomes concealed rather than [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]]. The wyrd can communicate empathically with any non-mindless creature affected by illuminating flames, even if they don't share a language.</span>

###  Comozant Communication

Creatures of emotion and instinct, comozant wyrds use simple images and concepts to convey deep and layered meanings. They're quite insightful, able to leap to solid conclusions as rapidly as they leap across solid surfaces. Most who “converse” with a comozant wyrd find the process enlightening, but have little desire make it a regular experience.
