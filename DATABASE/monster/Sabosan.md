# Sabosan

Sabosans are intelligent, bat-like humanoids who live in warm forests and drink the blood of other creatures, particularly people. They have thin, emaciated torsos and broad, leathery wings that can reach a span of almost 20 feet. Sabosans' heads, necks, shoulders, and upper chests are covered with red or dark-brown fur that obscures their stretched-thin flesh. Though their ears are large and pointed like a bat's and they can echolocate as bats do, their vision is also quite strong, enough so that they can use it to easily track quarry in low light.
 Some naturalist scholars believe that sabosans are distant descendants of humans who were afflicted with [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire|vampirism]] but managed to avoid succumbing to undeath. Others posit they were once a cult of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demon]] worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations among towns and cities south of Golarion's equator. Even mere rumors of sabosans in an area are enough to set off city-wide hunts, and the truly superstitious aren't above setting fires near every grotto, nook, and foxhole they come across in order to smoke out the nocturnal creatures.
 Sabosans hunt during the twilight hours or just after dark, when their echolocation gives them an edge over sleeping prey. They are capable hunters but indiscriminating when it comes to food sources; their rapid metabolisms means sabosans must eat nearly 20 pounds of meat and fruit per day, supplemented, of course, with copious amounts of blood.
 Sabosans' obscure faith reveres two deities: the slain Demon Lord Vyriavaxus, Lord of Shadows, and the nearly forgotten sun god Easivra. Vyriavaxus has an obvious link with the creatures, with his appearance as a giant bat, but their connection to the sun god hints at a complex depth in sabosan beliefs.

###  The Sabosan Kingdom

Sabosans were not always so confined to the edges of the wilderness. Once, many of their kind occupied the stone metropolis of Jaytirian in the heart of the Mwangi Jungle and defended it against the bestial forces of the dread Gorilla King. However, over the last few hundred years, some unknown force drove the sabosans out, and now they roam the Mwangi Expanse in dwindling numbers, searching for a new home.
