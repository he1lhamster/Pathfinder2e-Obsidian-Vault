# Wild Hunt Hound

Wild hunt hounds are intelligent hunters and expert trackers that take the lead against elusive prey. Left to their own devices, they seek out creatures that are notoriously difficult to track. They are always surrounded with green mist composed of fragments of the spirits of the wild hunt's victims, a mystic fog that forms itself into a spectral pack to fight at its side.

Those who meet the gaze of a wild hunt hound come face-to-face with the hunt's fearful power and find it difficult to act in the face of such a legendary legacy. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must succeed at a DC 31 Will save to resist becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] (slowed 2 on a critical failure). The wild hunt hound can deactivate or activate this aura by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Focus Gaze** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual) The wild hunt hound fixes its glare at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a Will save against the wild hunt hound's wild gaze. If the creature was already [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] by the wild gaze before attempting its save, a failed save causes it to be [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to Focus Gaze from any wild hunt until the start of the wild hunt hound's next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Summon Pack** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (aura, conjuration, primal) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** With a howl, the wild hunt hound summons a fog that manifests into several misty hounds. These foggy hounds shift and race and howl in a 20-foot aura as long as the wild hunt hound Sustains the effect. While the hounds seem to be made of fog, their teeth are very real, and any creature that ends its turn in this aura takes 6d6 piercing damage from numerous bites (DC 31 basic Reflex save).</span>
