# Squirrel Swarm

Descending with a shriek, a swarm of squirrels is a menace to foes, crawling in and out of pockets and clothing, biting and scratching as it goes. Though squirrels are usually independent, they might form into swarms when cornered or if a predator creates enough of a recurring threat that the little creatures need to gang up.
