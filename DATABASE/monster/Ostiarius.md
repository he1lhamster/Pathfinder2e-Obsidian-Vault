# Ostiarius

Ostiariuses, as emissaries of the velstracs, tend to the portals between the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] and the Material Plane. They not only escort other velstracs into the world of mortals, but also work to entice mortals into the realms of the velstracs— from which most mortals never leave. Among the most pleasant and persuasive of the velstracs, ostiariuses are prepared to converse for hours upon any topic, and they are skilled at returning, again and again, to the subject of the delights found in their perverse philosophies. Ostiariuses stand over 6 feet tall, and individuals range from skeletally thin to hugely corpulent.

**Painsight** (divination, divine) A velstrac automatically knows whether a creature it sees has any of the [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]], and [[DATABASE/condition/Wounded|wounded]] conditions, as well as the value of those conditions
**Sense Portal** (divination, divine) The ostiarius always knows the direction and distance to the closest portal between the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] and the Material Plane. This sense functions only on these two planes.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Compel Courage** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment, linguistic, mental) The ostiarius inspires their willing allies and themself by whispering words of courage from their wounds. The ostiarius and their allies in a 50-foot emanation gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves against fear effects. The ostiarius can Sustain Compel Courage. Non-velstracs who accept this compelled courage find bleeding wounds opening on their own bodies to whisper in thanks. They take 1 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] and can't attempt a flat check to end this damage as long as they're compelled.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Focus Gaze** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual, incapacitation) The ostiarius stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately attempt a Will save against Whispering Wounds. In addition, if the creature was already [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] and fails its save, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] by the ostiarius and can't use hostile actions. This fascination lasts for 1 round or until the ostiarius takes any hostile action against the creature or the creature's allies. Whether the creature succeeds at or fails the save, it is temporarily immune for 1 hour.</span>
