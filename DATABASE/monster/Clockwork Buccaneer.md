# Clockwork Buccaneer

Clockwork buccaneers are powerful constructs designed for naval combat. Whereas most clockwork creations sink to the ocean floor while at sea, clockwork buccaneers can use their water jets to easily propel themselves through the water or leap aboard enemy ships. In addition to an internal water tank and hydraulic pumps, most clockwork buccaneers are equipped with a cutlass and arm gun loaded with scatter shot.

###  Clockwork Shanties

Some inventors choose to imbue their clockwork buccaneers with automated voice modules instead of water tanks. Buccaneers can use these prerecorded songs or phrases to inspire living crew members or strike fear into enemies.
