# Cairn Linnorm

Cairn linnorms are disturbing, even by linnorm standards. They make their homes in necropolises, burial grounds, and the sites of immense and gory battles. Some point out that cairn linnorms feast on shambling undead and thus provide a service to the living, but these beasts are not choosy and will happily consume any creature, whether or not it draws breath.
 Some tales state that cairn linnorms will not—or cannot—enter a tomb without the permission of a descendant of the deceased (or the permission of the deceased itself, in the instance that it has risen from the dead). Likewise, once a cairn linnorm has entered a tomb, it won't leave until it has secured permission to do so. Whether such legends are true or not is anyone's guess; nevertheless, reports of a cairn linnorm in the vicinity are harrowing enough to dissuade even the most foolhardy grave robber from peeking into too many crypts or mausoleums.
