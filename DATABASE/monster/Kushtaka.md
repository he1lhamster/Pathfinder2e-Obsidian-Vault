# Kushtaka

Kushtaka, or “land otters” as they are sometimes known, are devious shapeshifters. They propagate by luring a humanoid away from the shelter of their home and slowly transforming the kidnapped creature into a new kushtaka. Kushtaka have an easier time transforming willing prey, so they prefer to use their shapeshifting ability and innate magical powers to convince their chosen targets to follow them away to a kushtaka village.
 Once a humanoid has been lured to a kushtaka village, they slowly begin to change, a bit at a time, until their body transforms fully into that of a kushtaka and ejects their mortal soul. These ejected souls often linger before giving rise to ghosts or haunts, though the kushtaka themselves are unaware of the souls' presence, having completely forgotten who they once were due to the magic that transformed them.
 Kushtaka can be a scourge to small human villages, slowly pilfering villagers away one person at a time. This might mean the kushtaka village displaces the human one, or leaves the human village unable to survive with too small a population to hunt, fish, defend against threats, or raise the next generation.

**Canine Vulnerability** Dogs and other canines are natural enemies of kushtaka. Canine animals, including creatures transformed into a canine using [[DATABASE/spell/Animal Form|animal form]] or a similar effect, ignore the kushtaka's resistance to physical attacks. In addition, a canine with imprecise [[DATABASE/monsterability/Scent|scent]] can use it as a precise sense when detecting a kushtaka.
**Null Spirit** Kushtaka exist completely separated from their mortal souls, making them immune to the effects of haunts and most effects from incorporeal spirits and undead, but also unaware of their presence; incorporeal undead are both invisible and inaudible to them. Incorporeal spirits and undead can affect a kushtaka only with effects that manifest in the physical world. For instance, a [[DATABASE/monster/Ghost Mage|ghost mage]] casting a [[DATABASE/spell/Fireball|fireball]] or a [[DATABASE/monster/Poltergeist|poltergeist]] throwing objects could harm the kushtaka, but a [[DATABASE/monster/Ghost Commoner|ghost commoner's]] Frightful Moan and ghostly hand Strike would not.

Every time the kushtaka uses this ability, it takes on the same chosen form, though it can use non-magical disguises to further alter its appearance.

###  The Shaman's Test

Some Varki villages in the far north acknowledge an aspiring shaman only after the acolyte has returned a tribe member transformed into a kushtaka back to their original form. This requires capturing the kushtaka in a net barbed with sharpened dog bones and then forcing the two halves of the soul back together.
