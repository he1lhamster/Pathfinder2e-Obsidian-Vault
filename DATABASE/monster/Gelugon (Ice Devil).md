# Gelugon (Ice Devil)

Insectile ice devils are strategists and masterminds in Hell’s armies, using their superior intellect to strike against their enemies and spread Hell’s influence throughout the planes. An ice devil rarely breaks their solitary contemplation of strategy save to pursue a plan they have devised. They can be enticed otherwise only by an exchange of services to be determined at a later time, adding to the pieces they can play on the board. Occasionally, a mortal strategist of outstanding skill might amuse an ice devil enough for the gelugon to agree to a contest of strategy, typically a strategic board game like chess, to decide a dispute. In the unlikely event the devil loses such a contest, they inevitably go to great lengths to later obtain that mortal’s services for their own infernal ends.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Slowing Frost** (cold, divine, evocation) The ice devil channels the extreme cold of its body through its appendages and weapons. A creature hit by an ice devil’s weapon or unarmed attack in melee must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1d4 rounds. A weapon used by an ice devil gains the effects of a [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost|frost rune]] while the gelugon holds it, and the ice devil can throw any such weapon with a 20-foot range increment, trailing motes of frost.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tactician of Cocytus** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate) An ice devil’s logical mind devises genius tactics from its perfect memory.

###  Fire and Ice

The classic depiction of Hell is of a burning wasteland of magma and volcanoes, a searing landscape rife with the screaming souls of the damned. Yet those who have visited Hell know the awful truth—for its torments do not cease at eternal burning. Some regions of hell are perpetual frozen reaches of razor-sharp ice and flesh-scouring wind, while others are miasmic swamps filled with poison and disease. Hell does not limit its torturous toolbox merely to the fires for which it is so well known!
