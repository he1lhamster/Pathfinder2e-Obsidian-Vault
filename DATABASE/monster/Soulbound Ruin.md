# Soulbound Ruin

Those who tread in ruined places sometimes speak of a sense that a supernatural presence is there alongside them, as if the spirits of the dead were watching intently. Such presences can be very real, often taking the form of ghosts or other shades of undead that cannot let go of their attachment to the Material Plane. But sometimes, instead of manifesting as distinct spirits, the souls of the dead infuse the very stone and mortar around them. When enough souls attach themselves to a single place—be it a home, crypt, or castle—it can take on a life of its own, becoming a soulbound ruin.

###  Soulbound Ruin Origins

Most often, soulbound ruins arise from guardians who died protecting the place, such as soldiers, priests, or patriots who refused to back down from an imminent threat. After death, the tormented spirits no longer recognize friend from foe and attack anyone or anything that trespasses upon their warded ground.
