# Vitalia

Foul occult magic, rare alchemical reagents, and copious amounts of spilled blood are the keys to creating a vitalia—also known as a heart horror— though thankfully the exact means of their creation has been long forgotten.
 Now, most vitalias now come into being by sheer accident. This unusual life-form cannot live without regular contact with blood, much like how fish cannot live long outside of water. Because of this, vitalias are rarely found outside the lairs of mad alchemists or wizards, living in pools of the life-giving substance. Physically, a vitalia somewhat resembles a blood-red [[DATABASE/monster/Giant Jellyfish|giant jellyfish]], though it also bears some semblance to a giant human heart.

All creatures in the area are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] from one another. A creature that benefits from consuming blood (such as [[DATABASE/monster/Bloodseeker|bloodseekers]] or [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire|vampires]]) gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing 10]] while in the area. While in the area, a creature taking [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] cannot end that condition, even if it spends actions to attempt a flat check to do so. The rain lasts for 1 minute.</span>

###  Living Livers

A vitalia's ability to filter and purify even days-old blood makes them highly sought after by certain powerful individuals, especially frail leaders or moguls in pursuit of eternal youth, vampires, or other creatures with sanguinary predilections.
