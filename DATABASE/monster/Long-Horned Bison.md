# Bison, Long-Horned

Much like their smaller [[Bison]] cousins, long-horned bison are bovines with short faces, two horns, a shaggy coat, and a noticeable hump on their back. Despite their relation to more placid bovines, however, long-horned bison are ill-tempered and territorial. Their tread shakes the ground, while the thunder of their stampedes can be mistaken for an earthquake. Long-horned bison weigh upwards of 4,500 pounds and measure up to 9 feet tall and 16 feet long. Their horns, measured tip to tip, can be almost as wide as the bison are tall.
