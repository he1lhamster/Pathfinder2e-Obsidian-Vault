###  Morlock Machines

Morlock engineers are talented at figuring out ancient machinery or damaged constructs, but don't keep notes or record their techniques. As a result, a morlock enclave might well be defended by strange, ancient mechanical hazards or constructs that treat morlocks as allies, even though none of the morlocks can say who built the machines they use.
