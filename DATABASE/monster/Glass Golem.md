# Glass Golem

Crafted of hardened glass and held together by magically treated lead, glass golems are both deadly guardians and works of exquisite art. Glass golems most often protect grand cathedrals or opulent palaces—testaments to the wealth and power of those they serve, or once served. Once spurred into action by the commands of their creators, glass golems are quicker and more agile than most other golems. Their sharp, blade-like limbs can easily sever veins and arteries, creating wounds that bleed profusely.
 Of all the various types of golems, the glass golem is the one most akin to a work of art. Just as powerful aristocrats might use an ice golem for temperature regulation or a wood golem as an ego-boosting statue, a glass golem's colorful glass construction can elevate the beauty of any chamber by its mere presence.

###  Glass Golem Components

The destruction of a glass golem often leaves nothing behind but a pile of tiny shards of crystal and lead. However, if larger pieces survive, the crystal can be sold to glass merchants or skilled crafters who can turn them into glittering works of art.
