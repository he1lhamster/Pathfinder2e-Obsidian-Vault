# Tenebric Giant

Necromancers reaching for the greatest heights of experimentation know that creating a new terror requires exacting, careful work at every stage of the process. In the case of the tenebric giant, this process begins with a [[DATABASE/monster/Tomb Giant|tomb giant]] who dies after consuming a dose of several poisons combined with the [[DATABASE/equipment/Shadow Ash|shadow ash]] reagent. This creates the right circumstances for a necromancer to raise them as a tenebric giant. They're particularly obedient to the will of the necromancer who created them and are charged full of energy from the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]], which grants them new powers and abilities.

###  Shadowy Cousins

[[DATABASE/monster/Shadow Giant|Shadow giants]] look upon tenebric giants with disdain and fear. They view these undead creatures not as giants but as a corruption of the true nature of the Shadow Plane, closer to [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Darvakka|darvakkas]] than kin. They tend to give tenebric giants a wide berth, unwilling to confront the powerful creatures.
