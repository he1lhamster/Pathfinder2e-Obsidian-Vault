###  Forgeheart Five

Stoneriver has fathered numerous children through the years, each clever, brave, and bold. Among these, five have joined together to combat evil as a team. Calling themselves the Forgeheart Five, these overly optimistic and bombastic creatures strive to be as virtuous and heroic as their father. Thus far, their methods have been more flashy than effective.
