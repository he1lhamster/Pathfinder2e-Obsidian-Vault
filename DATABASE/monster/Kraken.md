# Kraken

A kraken is an enormous, squid-like leviathan with a cruel intelligence. It hunts ships, whales, and heroes alike. The hatred and envy krakens hold for their rivals, the alghollthus, has led many krakens to make their lairs in sunken cities, where they can sift through ancient lore for long-lost arcane secrets.

###  Kraken Locations

A kraken dwells in deep ocean trenches, sunken cities, or caves and reefs near hydrothermal vents. It seeks food near the surface, however, where it can prey on seagoing vessels.

###  Kraken Treasure

A kraken’s hoard includes the plunder of ships lost at sea and the wealth of sunken cities. Virtually anything could be found in a kraken lair, but they especially covet scrolls, spell books, and other tomes of ancient lore, as well as gemstones and rarefied raw materials found only in the ocean depths.
