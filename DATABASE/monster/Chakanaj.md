# Chakanaj

Featureless, tiny bat-like flaps of pale skin with retractable, squirming legs, chakanajes prey upon people's shame and fears of disclosing humiliating secrets. Extremely diminutive and stealthy, they can slip into buildings or lurk under eaves with ease, making it easier to spy on others and learn their secrets. Chakanajes enjoy ferreting out secrets and tormenting their victims by leaving incriminating hints of the truth in places others might find them, or even messages threatening the victim that someone “knows the truth.” Fear of exposure can drive victims to commit atrocities, which a chakanaj uses to further exacerbate the victim's shame and fear, to the sahkil's ever-increasing enjoyment.
A chakanaj can disguise themself as an item of roughly the same size, like a piece of clothing, and they especially enjoy forcing their victims to carry or wear them while they whisper hateful suggestions and stoke the victim's anxiety and suffering. 
 While most sahkils don't have much to do with [[Norgorber]], despite their shared alignment, chakanjes' love of secrets has led to more than one alliance over the years between the tiny sahkils and the minions of Norgorber, particularly in Norgorber's aspect of the Reaper of Reputation.

**Ear for Secrets** A chakanaj knows when a creature within 30 feet lies unless that creature critically succeeds on its Perception check to [[Lie]] to the chakanaj. This ability doesn't reveal the truth.
 **Easy to Call** A sahkil's level is considered 2 lower for the purpose of being conjured by the [[Planar Binding]] ritual (and potentially other rituals, at the GM's discretion), but is always free to attack or leave instead of negotiate unless the primary caster's check is a critical success.

### Chakanaj Masks

Chakanajes like to cover a victim’s face and pretend to be a mundane mask. This not only lets them see anything their host does, but it lets them rest their sharp legs against the host’s face, a subtle threat of violence to keep a host in line.
