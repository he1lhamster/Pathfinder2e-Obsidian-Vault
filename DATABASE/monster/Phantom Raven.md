A creature greeting the phantom in this manner must attempt a DC 15 [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Critical Success** The phantom takes 4d8 mental damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Success** The phantom takes 2d8 mental damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Failure** The phantom takes 1d8 mental damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Critical Failure** The phantom is unaffected, and is not affected by this weakness for 1 round.</span>
