# Redcap

Redcaps are sadistic and capricious fey who thrill in bloodletting and murder. While they are most famous for appearing as wizened, bearded men, redcap women are no less fearsome or cruel. Redcaps are ultimately craven bullies, cowed by anything more powerful than themselves, a trait that leads them to fear and despise the symbols of good deities. Many fairy tales explain how the redcaps draw power from dipping the hats for which they are named in fresh blood. Just as iconic to these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging sound of their metal soles clanking on stone floors is both discordant and disconcerting— especially to those who recognize the sound for what it is. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with hunched frames, pointed ears, crooked teeth, and long, white, tangled hair.

**Red Cap** (necromancy, primal) A redcap’s woolen hat is dyed with the blood of its victims. If the redcap loses its cap, it no longer benefits from fast healing and takes a –4 status penalty to its damage rolls. It can create a new cap in 10 minutes, but that cap doesn’t grant its powers until the redcap has turned it red with Blood Soak. A cap has no benefit for creatures other than the redcap who made it.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Divine Revulsion** (emotion, fear, mental) If a redcap sees a creature brandish a religious symbol of a good deity (which requires an interact action by that creature) or use one to cast a divine spell, the redcap must attempt a DC 19 Will save.

###  Redcap Locations

Unlike some fey, redcaps don't embody a particular natural feature or environment, so they can be found almost anywhere. They tend to prefer areas that allow them to hide or at least get behind cover with their quick movement, such as forests, mountains, and underground tunnels and caverns.

###  Redcap Treasure

A redcap's boots and cap are of little value to other creatures, but it carries a scythe and various valuable trophies from its kills.
