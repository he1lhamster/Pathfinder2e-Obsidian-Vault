# Ancient Sky Dragon

Sky dragons live above the clouds near the summits of mountains. They maintain a strong religious tradition, a unique practice among imperial dragons that sets them apart as much as their wings do. Desperate souls risk steep cliffs and loose snow to seek these dragons' counsel, and most sky dragons gladly help those who make the journey, but they expel any express hostilities or badger without hesitation.
 The sky dragon's wings aren't true wings, but long fins fused to their forearms; their scales also form only very slowly. Young dragons coil tightly in their lairs as they absorb minerals that color and harden their scales. Even adults often wrap around pillars out of habit.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Countered by Fire** If the sky dragon takes fire damage, the elemental magic of metal within them is tempered. Until the end of their next turn, they take a –1 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and AC, and their jaws Strikes don't deal electricity damage. This limitation ends if the dragon uses Breath Weapon.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Fed by Earth** (abjuration, divine) When a sky dragon is targeted by an earth spell or effect, they leave a cloud of pulverized dust and gravel that swirls in the eddies of the dragon's flight.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, electricity, evocation) The dragon shoots a ball of electricity that deals 9d12 electricity damage and 2d12 sonic damage in a 30-foot burst within 60 feet (DC 40 basic Reflex save).

See divine lightning below.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Coiling Frenzy** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The dragon makes one claw Strike and one tail Strike in either order, each against the same target.

Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 40 Fortitude save; regardless of the outcome, the creature then becomes temporarily immune for 10 minutes. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** Half damage, and the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]]. 
**Failure** Full damage, and the creature is stunned for 1 round and can't fly for 4 rounds. 
**Critical Failure** Double damage, and the creature is stunned for 2 rounds and can't fly for 1 minute.</span>
