Each creature in the cone must attempt a DC 31 basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save is also [[Immobilized]] and takes 2d6 cold damage at the end of each of its turns until it gets free (Escape DC 31).

He takes a –1 penalty to AC and can't use actions with the concentrate trait (except Seek) unless they also have the rage trait.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Throw Rock]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> </span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wide Swing** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Kargstaad makes a single hatchet Strike and compares the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes within its reach. This counts as two attacks for Kargstaad's multiple attack penalty.</span>
