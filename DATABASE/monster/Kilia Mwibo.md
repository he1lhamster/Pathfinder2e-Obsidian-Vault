# Kilia Mwibo

Beautiful and dangerous, kilia mwibos appear as lush, green trees with brightly colored and appealing fleshy seedpods that remain attached year round. Over time, these seedpods become hollow and create an eerie, forlorn wail that generates feelings of sadness and despair.

**Emotion Sense** A kilia mwibo can sense nearby negative emotions. This is a precise sense against creatures who are under powerful emotion effects like [[DATABASE/action/Rage|rage]], those who are [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]], or, at the GM's discretion, those who are in the grips of hatred, sadness, or other overwhelming negative emotions. Against all other creatures that possess emotions, this is an imprecise sense. A creature that has no emotions is effectively invisible to a kilia mwibo. A creature that knows about emotion sense can take precautions to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] and [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]] from a kilia mwibo, in this case by suppressing feelings of negativity. You can flnd more details on hiding from special senses here.

###  Fear Feeders

Instead of drawing sustenance from light and soil, kilia mwibos gorge themselves on the negative emotions of creatures, eventually draining them of their life force and discarding their carcasses. When creatures recognize the true nature of the kilia mwibos and attempt to flee, the trees send out buried roots to trip and slow them down before grabbing them with their thorny fronds.
