# Catoblepas

The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times. Though it prefers swamps, the catoblepas has been know to forage in plains and forests for short periods, leaving behind hunting grounds tainted by its foul breath and noxious waste that other predators and prey alike avoid for days or even weeks thereafter. The catoblepas bullies those creatures it believes are a match for it, and eats everything weaker.
A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds.

**Stench** (aura, olfactory) 30 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (plus [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

###  Catoblepas Nests

A catoblepas den is an awful place indeed - a filthy nest composed of piles of decaying vegetation, half-finished or half-digested meals of decaying animals, never-quite-dry banks of mud, and tangles of thorny branches. Worse, the catoblepas's stink infuses such a site, imposing the beast's ungodly stench upon those who would explore and search within for treasure. A catoblepas nest can retain its stink in this way for up to a week after it's been abandoned by its foul denizen.
