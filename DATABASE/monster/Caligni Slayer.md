# Caligni Slayer

Caligni slayers possess greater occult talents than others of their kind. In most other calignis, the power bartered from the long-lost demigods known as the Forsaken merely burns within. But in caligni slayers, this power is a deep and terrible hunger. Slayers embrace their evil impulses as a result, and they seek to feed on others with their soul harvest ability to keep this supernatural hunger sated. Slayers denied the opportunity to feed descend into paranoia and, eventually, murderous rage.
Delayed feeding improves but never fully restores their composure and patience. Perhaps the greatest manifestation of a slayer's hunger appears at the moment of their death. Upon its last breath, a slayer collapses into itself in a violent, lightless implosion, rather than the blinding eruption of other calignis' deaths, consuming the body itself in a final attempt at satiation.
Slayers view themselves as the cleverest and most gifted of the calignis. They seethe with ill-concealed envy at the position of power [[DATABASE/monster/Caligni Stalker|caligni stalkers]] occupy, ever scheming to displace them and claim that power for their own. For their part, stalkers tolerate these machinations as an acceptable price for the talents slayers contribute to an enclave. If necessary, any slayer who grows too ambitious can become a brave sacrifice in battle, for the good of the enclave. In physical stature, slayers fall between the willowy [[DATABASE/monster/Caligni Dancer|caligni dancers]] and the diminutive [[DATABASE/monster/Caligni Creeper|creepers]]. Stalkers tower above most slayers—yet another source of slayers' envy and resentment.

###  Caligni Slayer Trinkets

Slayers obsess over magical trinkets, coveting them above all else. They often have a consumable or permanent item of use in combat, such as a scroll, wand, or talisman. Unfortunately, their incessant tinkering and fiddling often leaves their treasures broken or depleted.
