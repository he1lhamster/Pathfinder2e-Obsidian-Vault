description: 'The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species
  of hyenas, leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding
  vocal mimicry to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can first torment
  and then devour them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds,
  and they are perpetually filthy. A leucrotta''s oversized jaws are lined with rows
  of jagged, hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through flesh,

###  Hellforged Construct

Levalochs are strange amalgamations of devil and automaton, never requiring food or rest. The engravings on their iron plates indicate their hellish allegiance to a certain archdevil, infernal duke, malebranche, or Queen of the Night.
