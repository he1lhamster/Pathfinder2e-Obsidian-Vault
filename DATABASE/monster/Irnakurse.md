# Irnakurse

Irnakurse are surface elves who [[Drow]] have subjected to particularly cruel and humiliating fleshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the torment of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose flesh, and bony protrusions—parts that should be internal are often left on full display to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to hate their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all other targets.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected, and is temporarily immune to Soul Scream for 24 hours. 
**Success **The creature is [[Stupefied]] for 1 round. 
**Failure **The creature is stupefied 1. Further failed saves against Soul Scream increase the condition value by 1, to a maximum of stupefied 4. Each time the character gets a full night's rest, the stupefied condition gained from Soul Scream decreases by 1.

###  Irnakurse Mockeries

When drow capture a particularly hated surface elf, or one with a large following, they inflict even greater pain upon them during the fleshwarping process than most other victims. The resulting irnakurse are known as “mockeries,” and always have elite adjustments. Rather than using them, drow keep them close at hand as living “art” akin to a pet or trophy.
