# Nightmarchers

While smooth roads remain a traveler's blessing, walking them after sunset risks nightmarcher attack. The ringing of conch shells and beating of drums herald the coming of these spirits as they walk the royal highways, unfettered by walls or barriers. Nightmarchers react violently to those in their path. If a bystander is fortunate, an ancestor's spirit might call out to spare them. Those who refuse to show proper deference might be reduced to little more than ash on the wind come sunrise.

**Kinsense** (detection, divination, divine) Nightmarchers can detect creatures who are their kin, whether by blood or bond, as an imprecise sense. If they focus their senses on a creature by [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seeking]], they learn whether they are related to that creature, and how.

###  Avoidance and Deference

True to their name, nightmarchers tend to walk royal highways only after nightfall, making daytime travel safer. While they can traverse virtually any barrier, they can't cross ti leaves or similar sacred plants. If one finds themself in nightmarchers' presence, the last recourse is to show proper deference by lying flat on the ground with eyes shut—if one hears a ghostly voice call out to claim them, it means that an ancestor is present among the nightmarchers and has directed the procession to spare the bystander from harm.
