# Virulak Villager

A village of commoners raised to undeath by a mass poisoning might continue to go about the settled routines of life, posing an eerie scene for living creatures who enter their village. Virulak villagers prefer to attack with an advantage of numbers, but even a lone villager can pose a problem for unaware or inexperienced travelers.

###  The Mob's Spoils

Virulak villagers tear apart those who fall prey to their ruse of an ordinary village at work and consume the remains. They don't generally have much use for their victim's valuables and often stash them somewhere, such as in a root cellar or hayloft. A stealthy and canny infiltrator might discover a pile of blood-soaked valuables and escape without alerting the villagers.
