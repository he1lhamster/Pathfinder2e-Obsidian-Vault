# Carnivorous Crystal

Carnivorous crystals are strange ooze creatures native to the Plane of Earth. Unlike most oozes, their bodies are not homogeneously fluid; rather, interspersed within their glassy, viscous resin are thousands of sharp mineral formations that nevertheless possess some of the same flexibility and mobility as the rest of the creature’s gooey body.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Split** Whenever the carnivorous crystal takes a critical hit from an attack that deals bludgeoning or sonic damage, or it critically fails its saving throw against an effect that deals bludgeoning or sonic damage, it might split. If the carnivorous crystal has at least 15 HP remaining after taking the damage, it splits into two identical crystals, each with half the original’s Hit Points. When the carnivorous crystal splits, one crystal remains in the same space and the other appears in an adjacent unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, the crystal automatically pushes creatures out of the way to fill a space.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Subsonic Hum** (auditory, aura, mental) 60 feet.

###  Crystal Copies

Carnivorous crystals reproduce in two ways. Their preferred method is by infecting their victims with magical enzymes that cause living flesh to rapidly petrify and transform into immobile crystal. At the end of this process, the crystallized victim shatters as a newly born carnivorous crystal emerges from its cocoon. Like other oozes, however, they are also capable of reproducing by splitting, though they typically do so only under extreme duress.
