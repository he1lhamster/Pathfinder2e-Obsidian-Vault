<span class="in-box-ability">**Despair** (aura, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental) 30 feet. Living creatures are [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]] while in a mummy's despair aura. They can't naturally recover from this fear while in the area but recover instantly once they leave the area. When a creature first enters the area, it must succeed at a DC 30 Will save (after taking the penalty from being frightened) or be [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** Tentacle only.</span>

This fire does no additional damage to the mummy but does cause its melee Strikes to inflict an additional 1d6 fire damage. At the end of its turn, the mummy attempts a DC 10 flat check; on a success, the fire goes out. The fire also goes out immediately if the mummy submerges in water.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Oil Rot** (curse, disease, divine, necromancy) This disease and any damage from it can't be healed until this curse is removed. As the disease progresses, the creature's flesh grows leathery, while a foul-smelling oily layer spreads from painful splits in the dried skin. A creature killed by oil rot melts into a puddle of foul-smelling oil and can be resurrected only by a 7th-level [[DATABASE/ritual/Resurrect|resurrect]] ritual or similar magic; **Saving Throw** DC 33 Fortitude; **Stage 1** carrier with no ill effect (1 minute); **Stage 2** 10d6 negative damage and [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 2]] (1 day)</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tentacle Stab** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Frequency once per round; Effect The quoppopak makes two tentacle Strikes against the same creature. These Strikes deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning, and the quoppopak can't Grab with them. Its multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Water Glide** The quoppopak can stand and move on the surface of water or other liquids without falling through. It can go underwater if it wishes, but it must [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]] to do so.</span>
