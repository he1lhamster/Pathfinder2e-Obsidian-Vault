# Sceaduinar

Strange creatures born from jagged crystals in the heart of the [[DATABASE/plane/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], sceaduinar are fueled by its negative energy and driven to extinguish all life. Resembling crystalline gargoyles with serrated limbs and sharp, bat-like faces, sceaduinar stand about 7 feet tall and weigh around 100 pounds.
 These malevolent beings sometimes gather in great packs of their own kind. Despite their intelligence, they act like cunning, feral beasts for the most part, though they occasionally build tools to aid them in extinguishing life. Sceaduinar sail through the great voids of their home plane, seeking to destroy any sparks of life that find their way into that deadly realm—even the twisted sparks found in undead creatures.
 When they discover portals to other planes, sceaduinar swarm through in great numbers, slaughtering all they come across. While dwelling outside the Negative Energy plane is uncomfortable for sceaduinar, they can exist for extended periods of time apart from their home. Of course, the feeling of a plane where negative energy isn't the rule doesn't improve these creatures' attitude, and as a result, they tend to be particularly cruel and violent when encountered in such realms.

###  Sceaduinar Crystals

Sceaduinar congregate on the great crystalline knots of negative energy that accrete in the [[DATABASE/plane/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]]. Sceaduinar prod treelike crystal growths to produce dangerous items akin to spheres of annihilation or great structures that echo with eerie chimes. Sceaduinar also stimulate these aggregations of crystals to yield other sceaduinar and similar hateful creatures of unlife.
