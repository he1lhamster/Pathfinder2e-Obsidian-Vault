# Stone Lion Cub

Stone lion cubs are curious, playful, and occasionally accidental mischief makers. Despite their still developing abilities, they eagerly hone their skills with make-believe missions. Many hope that they'll one day become responsible guardians like their parents.
 Smaller in stature and ferocity, stone lion cubs sometimes try to guard places of smaller importance, often including facsimiles of the same kinds of structures their parents attend. They're less than dependable as guardians, as they have the attention span and rambunctious nature of children. Their parents often need to call them to heel, ordering them to stay at the parent's side as parent and child both stay motionless for the rising day.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bonded Vessel** The condition of a stone cub's vessel dictates the cub's maximum Hit Point value. Undamaged, the vessel is an object with 28 Hit Points (BT 14). When the cub is in spirit form, damaging it doesn't hurt the vessel, but damaging the vessel deals an equal amount of damage to the cub. When the cub Inhabits its Vessel, they're a single target, and damage reduces the Hit Points of both the cub and the vessel. If the vessel is [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], the cub can still fight normally while inhabiting it and suffers no ill effect, but if the vessel is ever destroyed, the cub is instantly slain and can't reconstitute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Reconstitution** (divine, necromancy) When the cub reaches 0 Hit Points, its spirit dissipates. If its bonded vessel is intact, the cub re-forms in this vessel after 2d4 days, fully healed. If the vessel is [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], it must first be [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repaired]], after which the cub reforms in 3d4 days.</span>

The cub touches and melds with its bonded vessel, bringing the statue to life. It can cease Inhabiting its Vessel by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait. While Inhabiting the Vessel, it loses its fly Speed and gains **Immunities** healing, nonlethal; **Resistances** physical 3 (except bludgeoning); **Speed** 20 feet; and the following Strike.

###  Bleeding Omen

Legends say that stone lions can predict incoming storms or floods. If a stone lion's eyes, nose, or ears bleed, preparations should be made. Lone survivors of these disasters claim those who disparage such omens as superstition often don't live to see the next dawn.
