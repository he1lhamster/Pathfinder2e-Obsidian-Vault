# Giant Badger

The violent, territorial giant badger is a relentless predator. An obligate carnivore, its prey ranges from rabbits to deer, livestock, and even the occasional traveler or adventurer. A giant badger's claws are sharp and strong enough to carve tunnels from solid rock. They typically stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh 500 pounds.

###  Trained Diggers

[[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Kobold|Kobolds]] and others who dwell in underground warrens know the value of having a few trained giant badgers in their lair, since when their digging habits are supervised and directed, they can excavate new tunnels and chambers with ease. Of course, the fact that giant badgers find kobolds and others who dwell in underground warrens delicious means that relying on such trained diggers can be a risky endeavor. A giant badger trained for use as a digger or a guardian tends to only obey the commands of one master, and even then they can be prone to unpredictable outbursts for no reason other than pique
