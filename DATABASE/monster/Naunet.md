# Naunet

Pugnacious and powerfully muscled, naunets serve as scouts and rank-and-file troops of protean armies. Resembling a thick salamander with a wide head, a powerful tail, and tentacles tipped with snapping jaws in place of rear legs, naunets are the most bestial of the proteans and occupy one of their lowest castes. Naunets are 12 feet long and weigh 900 pounds.
 All proteans are prone to unpredictable fits and unexpected action, but compared to most others, naunets are much more bestial. Always ready for a fight, naunets pride themselves in acting swiftly and striking before unpleasant distractions like diplomacy can blunt a combat’s beginning.

**Entropy Sense** (divination, divine, prediction) A naunet can anticipate the most likely presence of a creature through a supernatural insight into chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants it the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Nondetection|nondetection]] or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Protean Anatomy** (divine, transmutation) A naunet’s vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the naunet takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> The naunet is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If blinded or deafened, the naunet automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.</span>
