# Fossil Golem

Fossil golems are typically made from the fossilized bones of dinosaurs and other ancient megafauna, though some crafters stretch the definition and instead use magically petrified bones of dragons or even giants. Not bound to any specific model, fossil golems are crafted to be as terrifying as possible instead of models of anatomic accuracy. As such, most fossil golems are nightmarish saurian amalgams whose massive arms end with the complete skulls of apex predators like tyrannosauruses, their bite enhanced to petrify flesh.
 The enchantments that animate fossil golems grant them a form of modular flexibility, letting them trade mobility for extended reach through the rapid rearrangement of their limbs. This also lets them appear like a jumbled mass of bones at rest, making them likely to be mistaken for decor rather than guardians.

###  Digging is Optional

Intact fossilized bones are difficult components to scrounge, much less whole skeletons. An alternate way to obtain them is to hire expert hunters or adventurers to seek out live dinosaurs, bring back the bones, and use magic to turn them to stone. Of course, some purists prefer genuine fossilized bones and are willing to pay the price for their acquisition. Either way, opportunities await enterprising souls with the proper tools and several [[DATABASE/equipment/Bag of Holding|bags of holding]].
