description: To some, kashrishi seem to be a quiet, passive people. Those with a deeper
  understanding know that there's plenty more nuance to interacting with kashrishi,
  who possess innate psychic abilities that greatly alter the way they communicate
  with the rest of the world. Unable to turn off their powers, these abilities add
  a complex dynamic to interpreting their surroundings. Without deeper understanding
  of a person, kashrishi are only able to get the most vague, general feelings from
  people around them. This becomes more refined as their relationships evolve; family
  and friends are often the easiest to engage in psychic communication, while strangers
  simply add to the amount of mental noise a kashrishi must process.<br/><br/> Kashrishi
  resemble rhinoceroses, with soft, textured skin that can range from light sandy
  hues to darker obsidian, or rarer jewel tones of deep sapphire or ruby. The size
  and number of their horns vary. Kashrishi communities are generally quite welcoming
  to others, enjoying the conversation and unique auras of every new stranger. However,
  chaotic environments can overwhelm and overstimulate kashrishi not yet adept at
  filtering psychic energies, leaving some with limited tolerance for extensive social
  interaction with strangers and requiring they take periods of time to refocus after
  socializing. In spite of this possible drawback, kashrishi are typically strong
  communicators, excelling at roles that require attention to detail.<div class="viewbox">{{
