# Ichor Slinger

While the typical snake oil salesperson seeks riches, some medical fraudsters become so enamored with the swindler lifestyle they reanimate to keep living the lie. Known as ichor slingers, these cadaverous alchemists disguise themselves to walk among the living. There they gleefully concoct tonics and peddle cure-alls, charismatically convincing bystanders to overlook questionable ingredients and credentials. Ichor slingers feed on others' attention and trust, caring little for clients' health so long as buyers imbibe the offered medicines. Conversely, rejection infuriates ichor slingers. The undead often stalk, subdue, and administer unwanted medicines to those who snub them. When not selling “panaceas,” ichor slingers harvest macabre ingredients to make dubious new medicines.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Mystery Ingredients** (auditory, aura, occult) 60 feet. Creatures in the aura take a –2 status penalty to checks to [[Identify Alchemy]], [[Recall Knowledge]] about alchemical subjects, or examine snake oil effects. When a creature first enters the area, if it hears the ichor slinger talking, it must attempt a secret Will save against the slinger's [[Deception]] DC. On a failure, it treats its next failed check to Identify Alchemy or Recall Knowledge about alchemical subjects in the next 24 hours as though it were a critical failure instead. This is an auditory misfortune effect.</span>

Tomb juice has the effects of snake oil, and maybe more depending on the results of the ichor slinger's DC 20 [[Crafting]] check.
 **Critical Success** The slinger chooses one of the following items and adds its effects to the tomb juice: [[Antidote]], [[Antiplague]], [[Elixir of Life]], [[Giant Scorpion Venom]], or [[Juggernaut Mutagen]]. Poisons created in this way gain an onset of 1 round, gain the ingested trait, and lose any contact, inhaled, or injury traits.
 **Success** As critical success, but the slinger chooses from lesser antidote, lesser antiplague, minor elixir of life, [[Graveroot]], or lesser juggernaut mutagen.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Exhume** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate) **Requirements** The ichor slinger is adjacent to a dead creature that hasn't already been affected by Exhume; **Effect** The ichor slinger harvests portions of the corpse to gain 1 dose of infused reagents, or 2 infused reagents if the creature was undead.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Force Feed** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** The ichor slinger has a creature [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] and is holding tomb juice, an alchemical elixir, or an alchemical poison; **Effect** The ichor slinger forces the target to consume the alchemical item.</span>

###  Unlikely Allies

Rarely, ichor slingers can be non-evil. These variants crave validation and might have once been a physician who failed to detect a plague or a similarly disgraced practitioner of medicine. These alchemists might provide unreliable assistance to heroes and innocents. It's even possible that helping such an ichor slinger cure a disease outbreak could peacefully lay their soul to rest.
