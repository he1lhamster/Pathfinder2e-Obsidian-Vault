# Priest of Kabriri

A great number of powerful entities have vied for the mantle of patron of the undead, but none of these is more venerated among ghouls than the demon lord [[Kabriri]], Him Who Gnaws. Nearly all ghouls who are inclined to worship gods dedicate themselves to Kabriri, who is honored through profane rituals and macabre ceremonies centered on the gluttonous consumption of sentient beings. Presiding over these liturgies are the priests of Kabriri, particularly vile and cunning ghouls who are specifically tasked by their primogenitor with the duty to ensure his numerous progeny need never go hungry.
