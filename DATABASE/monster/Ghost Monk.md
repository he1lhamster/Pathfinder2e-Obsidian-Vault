**HP** 115 ([[DATABASE/monsterability/Negative Healing|negative healing]], rejuvenation); **Immunities** death effects, disease, [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], poison, precision, [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]]; **Resistances** all damage 10 (except force, [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]], or positive; double resistance vs. non-magical)
<span class="in-box-ability">**Rejuvenation** (divine, necromancy) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting. Putting the abbot in A8 to rest brings peace to the ghost monks, allowing them to move on to the Serene Circle in [[DATABASE/plane/Axis|Axis]].</span>
