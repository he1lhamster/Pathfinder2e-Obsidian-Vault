# Thanadaemon (Death Daemon)

Also known as the deacons of death, thanadaemons represent death via old age. They are among the most patient daemons, and prefer to bide their time to enact far-reaching, decades-long plans rather than fight (though they are still deadly foes). Like the Horseman of Death, they ply the waters of the River Styx in search of wayward souls. Rarely are thanadaemons seen without a trademark oar (which they wield as a [[DATABASE/weapon/Bo Staff|bo staff]]), a tool they use to navigate the river's muck-ridden channels and turbulent rapids.

###  Styx Passage Fees

Gliding with eerie ease along the murky River Styx, thanadaemons are only too happy to offer mortals passage aboard their dilapidated skiffs—for a price. Gold is typically an acceptable payment for a thanadaemon's services, though these fiends are well-known for altering the details of arrangements after the fact, and may just as likely demand a favor or some esoteric good, such as a soul gem, instead of coin.
