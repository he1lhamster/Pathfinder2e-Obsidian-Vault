# Scarecophagus

Originally created by Gebbite necromancers during the war against Nex, the scarecophagus is an evil construct that draws power directly from the undead [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Mummy|mummy]] trapped forever within its sealed core. This necromantic energy is channeled throughout the construct's body, allowing it to scuttle about on legs of stone, animate tentacles to strike at foes, and use the mummy's trapped mind for its own sapience and magical powers.

###  What's in a Name

The original name for this frightening construct has been lost to time, with the farcical nickname of “scarecophagus” granted it by a band of particularly infamous adventuring bards. As their comedic tales spread throughout the Impossible Lands, the name quickly stuck. The original creators of the monsters were, no doubt, displeased.
