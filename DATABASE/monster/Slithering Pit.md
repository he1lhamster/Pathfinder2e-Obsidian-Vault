# Slithering Pit

A slithering pit is a strange, nearly invisible ooze with an extradimensional space for its digestive system, which mimics the appearance of an acid-filled stone pit. It slowly dissolves its captives in stomach acid until they can be digested. A slithering pit can go weeks without feeding, affording it patience.
 Thriving in dilapidated areas, slithering pits take up positions among the plentiful potholes where they can easily pass for just another blemish. They crawl across ramshackle cobblestone streets and damp underground complexes, waiting for unwary prey to stumble by and fall in.

**Transparent** A slithering pit is so clear it's difficult to spot. A successful DC 30 Perception check is required to notice a stationary slithering pit, and a creature must be [[Search]] to attempt this check. A creature that walks into the pit's space might fall into any pit currently in effect due to Dimensional Pit.

Any other creature occupying or entering pit spaces must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or fall into the pit, taking damage from the fall (typically 10 bludgeoning damage). Any creature grabbed by the ooze falls in and is no longer [[Grabbed]], even if it was outside the pit squares. While a dimensional pit is open, the slithering pit is [[Immobilized]], can't be forced to move, and can make pseudopod Strikes originating from the walls of the pit. A creature that starts its turn at the bottom of the pit takes 2d6 acid damage. Climbing the walls of the pit requires a DC 22 [[Athletics]] check. When the slithering pit dies, the dimensional pit closes and creatures inside are ejected, with the effects of Out You Go.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Flurry of Pods** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The slithering pit makes a single pseudopod Strike against each target within range it doesn't already have [[Grabbed]].

Each occupant takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save).</span>

###  A Living Pit, Really?

Slithering pit lore is as strange and confusing as the creature itself. Was it created by a wizard in need of a handy garbage disposal? Did it result from some unfortunate accident involving hungry oozes and one [[Bag of Holding]] too many? Why do its insides mimic the appearance of stone, but without the same toughness? Is it some form of camouflage, letting them pass for an oft-ignored hazard? So many questions...
