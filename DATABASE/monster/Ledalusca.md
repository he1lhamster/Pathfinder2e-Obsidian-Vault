# Ledalusca

Ledaluscas are reflective water elementals that can bring forth images previously reflected on their surfaces and wholly freeze themselves in the shapes of what they reflected. They explore and protect the calmest boundaries of the icy regions of the [[Plane of Water]], where ice forms in shiny, flawless sheets.
 Insatiably curious, their eagerness propels some ledaluscas to pickpocket interesting-looking objects to play with. Others travel to different planes to locate, observe, and reflect a wider variety of creatures than those on their home plane. They pretend to be ice sculptures or still pools for this purpose, especially if they can find a spot in a high-traffic area to inhabit. Despite their perfect mimicry, ledaluscas are unable to create an appearance from scratch, nor can they adjust the appearance they take on or combine elements of different reflections. Some of them find this disheartening, like artists vexed by a lack of creativity.
 One of the strangest encounters a ledalusca can experience is with a creature or object that has no reflection. A ledalusca can see a [[Vampire]], for example, but is unable to reproduce its image. For a creature that effectively has an unlimited memory for images, this proves utterly confusing. The vague memory of the encounter sticks in the ledalusca's mind like a splintering a humanoid's finger.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Shell Block <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** The ledalusca takes physical damage from an attack; **Requirements** The ledalusca's shell is frozen (see Freeze Shell); **Effect** The ledalusca angles their shell to absorb the blow, gaining resistance 5 to the triggering damage.

They have an automatic result of 28 on [[Deception]] checks and DCs to pass as what they appear to be.</span>

###  Treasured Reflections

A ledalusca must bring forth an old reflection to closely observe its details, much like a reader would need to reread text. Ledaluscas can't store reflections of reflections, but they enjoy studying interesting reflections from their kin. Some of these elementals accept novel reflections as suitable payment for favors or information.
