# Myrucarx

The slithering, shapeless beings known as myrucarxes occasionally slip into the [[Material Plane]] from their domains deep in the [[Shadow]], seeking to torment those who love light. Myrucarxes weave powerful illusions to draw unsuspecting victims into their squirming embrace, and they favor large cities as hunting grounds. Rather than devastate a community, a myrucarx instead prefers to snatch only a few victims to engender fear and paranoia, then retreat somewhere dark to hibernate for months or years before renewing its terrors. A myrucarx resembles a monstrous, oily slug with tentacles ending in gnashing jaws, but most victims only ever see the illusory personas it projects to lure and torment its prey.

###  Myrucarx Cabals

Myrucarxes rarely defer to any other creature, but they grudgingly acknowledge the authority of cabals of powerful myrucarxes dwelling in deep caverns on the [[Shadow]]. These cabals don't bother with the mundane work of terrorizing [[Material Plane]] cities; instead, they engage in worlds-spanning schemes to extinguish suns and create entire planets of cold, benighted horror.
