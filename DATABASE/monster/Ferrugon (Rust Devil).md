# Ferrugon (Rust Devil)

Ram-headed devils with wings and flesh of rusted metal, ferrugons prefer temptation to fighting. They're forged from the souls of damned mortals who made others suffer through their creative work. They like to collect those of the same ilk, often by dipping the bodies of mortals they've driven to despair into molten metal to make horrifically malformed statues they add to their lairs.

The target must attempt a DC 32 Will save. On a failure, the target gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws against fear effects but also takes a –2 penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks for 1 hour. During this time, the victim can't benefit from [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] reactions, use healing effects on themselves, or use [[DATABASE/action/Take Cover|Take Cover]] or [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]] actions, as these actions seem unnecessary to the creature at this time. Similar defensive actions might not be available to the victim as well, at the GM's discretion. The target is then temporarily immune to Vainglorious Whispers for 24 hours.</span>

###  Makers of Rust

A ferrugon's [[DATABASE/spell/Flesh to Stone|flesh to stone]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Stone|wall of stone]] innate spells result in rusted iron objects instead of stone. Since this iron is rusted and flawed, it shares the same physical statistics as the stone created by the spells themselves and is too low-quality to serve as a source for forging metal objects.
