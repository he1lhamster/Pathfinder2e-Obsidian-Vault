# Grimple

Even more than most gremlins, grimples resent the trappings of civilization: inn common rooms with their rowdy singalongs, livery yards with their whinnying horses, church steeples with their clanging bells. Grimples live to spoil these conventions, dropping tavern signs on patrons, urinating in rain barrels, and opening stable doors. When all else fails, they literally vomit their disdain on passersby.
 Grimples resemble humanoid, mange-ridden opossums, with boar-like tusks that aid them in rooting through garbage heaps for food. They are agile climbers who glide from eave to eave on the loose flaps of skin between their limbs. Savvy gremlin-hunters know to look for the skin flakes and fur grimples shed from their parasite-infested hides.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Gremlin Lice** Whenever a living creature touches or is touched by a grimple (including via a successful unarmed melee Strike), it must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or become infested by gremlin lice. While infested, the targeted creature is distracted by the itching sensation and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]], though it can use an Interact action to scratch at the itching lice to suppress the stupefied condition from the lice for 1d4 rounds. The infestation ends after 24 hours or until the creature is submerged in water or exposed to a severe cold environment, whichever comes first.</span>

###  Grimple Allies

[[DATABASE/monster/Vexgit|Vexgits]] and grimples sometimes team up to cause ruin. Squatting in abandoned clock or bell towers, insectile vexgits use cranky grimples to lure victims into elaborate death traps. Left to their own devices, grimples bully [[DATABASE/monster/Mitflit|mitflits]] or train [[DATABASE/monster/Giant Rat|giant rats]] and [[DATABASE/monster/Spider Swarm|spider swarms]] to do their bidding.
