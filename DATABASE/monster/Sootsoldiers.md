# Sootsoldiers

Powerful deities and warlords strive for dominance over the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] and the rest of the Inner Sphere in order to prove fire's supremacy. Armies of flaming soldiers go to war against each other on battlefields of smoke and smoldering char, all unable to bring their full power to bear. [[DATABASE/deity/Ymeri|Ymeri]], the vicious and victorious Queen of the Inferno, commands legions of sootsoldiers: elementals capable of battling the armies of her foes and, even when destroyed, rising from the ashes of the Eternal Furnace, scorched and triumphant.

The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Troop Defenses|Troop Defenses]]** </span>

At the end of this movement, a wave of flame and heat pours off the sootsoldiers, dealing 4d8 fire damage to other creatures in a 10-foot emanation, with a DC 29 basic Reflex save.

This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any of the sootsoldiers' squares enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop</span>

###  The Radiant Host

Sootsoldiers who serve the other Lord of Fire, the Lambent King [[DATABASE/deity/Atreia|Atreia]], are covered in glowing embers instead of black char. In place of ashen smoke's normal effects, any creature in the area must attempt a DC 29 Reflex save. On a failure, for 1 minute that creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] and its invisibility is negated.
