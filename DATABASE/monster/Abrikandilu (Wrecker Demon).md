description: "Once devout followers whose faith proved false, abandoned zealots return\
  \ from the doorstep of the afterlife after being denied the eternal reward they\
  \ expected. Consumed by self-loathing for the lives they squandered to false faiths\
  \ and empty creeds, these lost souls serve as terrifying and implacable\u2014yet\
  \ ultimately pathetic\u2014foes. A shapeless mass of smoke and shadow coils behind\
  \ their broken masks. As abandoned zealots move, they spit and shriek a hateful\
  \ cacophony of bitter lamentations and anguished weeping.<br/><br/> Abandoned zealots\
  \ are most commonly associated with the church of Razmir, which upholds a mortal\
  \ wizard as a god\u2014a truth unknown to most worshippers. However, abandoned zealots\

  \ tenets or aims. This situation could easily result from the cruel schemes and\

# Abrikandilu (Wrecker Demon)

Wrecker demons, also known as abrikandilus, despise beautiful things and do everything in their power to destroy both people and objects regarded as such. An abrikandilu forms from the souls mortals who were vandals, misanthropes, or defacers of artwork, particularly if their destructive actions stemmed from feelings of powerful envy.
 An abrikandilu loathes only one thing more than beauty: their own visage. The mere sight of their face—reflected in a mirror, a shield, or even a pool of water— can send a wrecker demon into a rage. Many demon slayers leverage tactic to their advantage, venturing into battle with polished steel shields and cold iron blades at the ready.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Hatred of Mirrors** An abrikandilu loathes the sight of their reflection. When a creature Interacts with a mirror within sight of the wrecker demon, the demon takes a –2 penalty to Will saves against [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks. An abrikandilu that ends their turn adjacent to a mirror or that's attacked by a creature holding a mirror takes 1d6 mental damage (this usually leads abrikandilus to focus their efforts on destroying nearby mirrors using Wreck).</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Mutilating Bite** (curse, divine, necromancy) When the abrikandilu hits a creature with a jaws Strike, the creature must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or become physically mutilated. The creature then takes a –1 status penalty to Charisma-based checks. This penalty is cumulative up to –3 and remains even if the wounds are healed. The penalty is reduced by 1 every 24 hours until it reaches 0.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wreck** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The abrikandilu makes two claw Strikes against an unattended object or held mirror. Held mirrors use the holding character's AC. If both Strikes hit, combine their damage for the purpose of overcoming any Hardness or resistance. These Strikes don't count toward the abrikandilu's multiple attack penalty, nor does that penalty apply to these Strikes.</span>

###  Demons of Vandalism

It is a strange irony that abrikandilus despise all works of artistry, yet without the objects of their jealousy they would have nothing to rage at but themselves.
