description: "In the ancient days, before humanity dwelled on Golarion, the Vault\
  \ Builders had need of something smaller in scale than the great vault seeds so\
  \ they could finish their worlds as they liked. They took a small gem and wrote\
  \ a word of power upon it. They gave it eyes so it could see and legs so it could\
  \ walk, and made it wise. These creatures are known as kaseshi by scholars who have\
  \ encountered them, though their true name\u2014the one that brought them into being\u2014\
  is likely considerably more powerful.<br/><br/> Each kasesh bears a single word\
  \ of power on their emerald body, from which they draw their mind and their magic.\
  \ A kasesh with the word \u201CSteel\u201D or \u201CFlame\u201D is a single-minded\
  \ creature, though it encompasses all possible permutations of meaning that the\
  \ word possesses. A kasesh named \u201CHome\u201D or \u201CSorrow\u201D has a far\
  \ more complex psyche, and rumor claims that Elder Architect Oblosk of Nex bears\
  \ the word \u201CMemory.\u201D Unsurprisingly, many scholars are highly interested\
  \ in the words on the kaseshi; unlike Thassilonian rune magic, no one has managed\
  \ to decode or make use of the language of the Vault Builders yet.<br/><br/> The\
  \ kasesh in the stat block bears the word \u201CStone,\u201D but other kaseshi will\
  \ have their own magics. Some alternative examples, \u201CDarkness\u201D and \u201C\

###  Rift Makers

Katpaskirs sense weaknesses in planar fabric. These demons worm their way into spaces between dimensions and break down the barriers. They leave holes aimed at causing chaos and dissolution. In this way, katpaskirs gnaw at reality, hoping to one day unravel it.
