# Dyzallin Shraen

Dyzallin Shraen wants nothing more than bring the city of Shraen under his sole control. Having secured the _aeon orb_ that Aroden left behind, Dyzallin labors to unlock its secrets.
When House Shraen was exiled from Zirnakaynin for vile religious practices deemed unsavory even by other [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Drow|drow]], Dyzallin Shraen sought a new home with the rest of his clan. Many drow perished along the way, including several of Dyzallin's relatives and rivals. Because the survival of the house was at stake and House Shraen didn't balk at the idea of raising their fallen as undead, many of his rivals returned—often more powerful than before. By the time the exiled drow house discovered the ancient [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Xulgath|xulgath]] city that would bear their name, the living among them had become an underprivileged minority.
 While Dyzallin was one of the few who had survived the deadly exodus, in the end, he too chose undeath, deeming life detrimental to his quest for power. Leveraging all his connections within his faction, the Sunscar Oath, Dyzallin acquired a set of scrolls detailing a secret method of attaining immortality through mummification atop a specially prepared mirror.
 More powerful than ever before, the newly undead Dyzallin swiftly accumulated wealth and influence, rivaling even Zyra and Nyrinda Shraen, the city's leaders. He isn't yet ready to challenge the status quo in Shraen, but he believes his time is near at hand.
 Dyzallin has recently focused his attention on the magic orb he learned about in Xul-Khundur. He initially thought the orb was designed to control [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Cave Worm|cave worms]]; this power alone he might have leveraged into a plot to surprise and eliminate his rivals. But he learned the orb's true purpose, and believes that its life-giving energies might allow him to utterly destroy the undead kin who stand in his way. He has acquired the orb's resonant reflection, and as a curious side effect, his rotten skin is beginning to heal, and he feels more energetic than he has in millennia. Convinced of the orb's power, Dyzallin believes it is only a matter of time before he unlocks its magic and gains control of Shraen.

## Campaign Role

As the current keeper of the _aeon orb_ that the heroes seek, Dyzallin has unwittingly become the adventure's main antagonist. Until the heroes arrive in Shraen and start causing trouble, Dyzallin isn't even aware of them; even while they're in Shraen, Dyzallin is too involved in his research to spare them much attention. When the heroes finally assault his tower, he arranges for the most powerful defense he can muster. Dyzallin isn't interested in why the heroes want the orb, and he's prepared to keep it from them at any cost.
 Because of Dyzallin's mirror rejuvenation ability, it's likely he survives the encounter with the heroes. After his defeat, the eternally patient mummy starts anew, determined to find another way to gain control of Shraen. If the heroes angered him enough, he might pursue them to the surface, only to discover the other _aeon orbs_ there for the taking. Dyzallin could become a significant threat to the Starstone Isles and might return as an ongoing threat to the heroes.
