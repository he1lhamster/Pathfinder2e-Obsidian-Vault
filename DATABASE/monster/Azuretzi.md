# Azuretzi

Azuretzis are sinuous, serpentine creatures with dagger-sharp teeth, covered in brilliant blue scales with mottled purple and pink highlights that shimmer in a pareidolic approximation of leering, laughing faces. The [[DATABASE/plane/Maelstrom|Maelstrom's]] chaotic forces spawn these small proteans from a variety of sources: physical mating between older azuretzis, the paradoxical promotion of bestial [[DATABASE/monster/Naunet|naunets]], and possibly from mortal [[DATABASE/monster/Petitioner|petitioners]], though azuretzis may just be confusing putative mortal memories with experiences gained from games of mimicry. Never expect azuretzis to operate by any rational, self-consistent rules.
 Azuretzis represent the humor of chaos, particularly in the form of mockery and parody via exaggerated mimicry, twisting a target's features into a laughingstock.

**Entropy Sense** (divination, divine, prediction) An azuretzi can anticipate the most likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the azuretzi the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Nondetection|nondetection]] or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Protean Anatomy** (divine, transmutation) An azuretzi's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the azuretzi takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> The azuretzi is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]], the azuretzi automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spell Pilfer <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** A creature with an active spell effect within 30 feet of the azuretzi fails to resist another azuretzi's Mocking Touch; **Effect** The azuretzi attempts to counteract one ongoing spell effect on the target creature with a [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check. If it is successful, it transfers the ongoing spell effect to itself. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to Spell Pilfer for 24 hours.</span>

The azuretzi must attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check against the target's Will DC. 
**Critical Success** The azuretzi chooses one spell of up to 3rd level that the target creature has available to cast. The azuretzi gains that spell as a mock divine innate spell, and it can cast that spell once as an innate divine spell using its own DC and spell attack. It must do so before 24 hours pass or the mock spell is lost. The creature touched cannot cast the mock spell until the azuretzi casts it first or the 24 hour period passes, whichever comes first. 
**Success** As critical success, but the azuretzi has 1 hour to cast the mock spell before it is lost, and the creature touched can cast the spell normally. 
**Failure** As critical success, but the azuretzi must cast the mock spell before the end of its next turn or it is lost, and the creature touched can cast the spell normally. 
**Critical Failure** Mocking Touch has no effect.</span>

###  Mock Choruses

Azuretzis form mock choruses in emulation of their more powerful kindred, aping the shifting philosophies of proper choruses. While mischievous or outright malevolent to hostile or lawful creatures, they interact amiably with chaotic creatures, who run the risk of being promptly followed–willingly or not–by a serpentine gaggle of self-appointed understudies.
