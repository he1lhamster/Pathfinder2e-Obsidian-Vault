# Rune Giant

Magically crafted and bred by ancient wizards, rune giants are anathema to and tyrants among their own kind, who were given power to command and magically control other giants. The rune giants themselves served even more powerful masters—potent wizards known as runelords—and in so doing commanded entire armies of giants on behalf of the runelords’ empires. In the eons since these empires collapsed, rune giants have persisted as a people of their own, though to the outside world they’re little more than fabled horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants. Rune giants usually dwell in the most remote and rugged of towering mountain ranges, but they can also be found in immense ruins atop lost islands, glacial valleys, or even more remote or magical regions.
 Rune giants’ striking charcoal flesh is decorated by dozens of runes, which are potent manifestations of their eldritch powers. Rune giants are towering creatures, averaging at 40 feet in height and weighing 25,000 pounds.

 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

 A glowing copy of the invoked rune appears on a single weapon the giant holds, granting the weapon one effect listed below of the giant’s choice. The giant can’t use Invoke Rune again for 1d4 rounds. The effect on the weapon lasts for 1 minute. If the giant places a new rune on a weapon, any previously placed rune immediately vanishes, ending its effect.

* **Rune of Destruction** The weapon gains the deadly trait with three weapon damage dice of the same die size as for the base weapon, and a creature hit with the weapon is drained 1 unless it succeeds at a DC 35 Fortitude save.
* **Rune of Flames** The weapon deals an additional 3d6 fire damage on all attacks.
* **Rune of Smiting** When the weapon hits, the giant can Push the target back 10 feet, or 20 feet on a critical hit.

###  The First Rune Giants

On Golarion, the first rune giants were created by the powerful rulers of the ancient nation of Thassilon, The runelords gifted rune giants their ability to control other giants, using them to command armies of oversized builders and soldiers to create and defend oversized structures.
