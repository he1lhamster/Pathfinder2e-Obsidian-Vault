###  Makers of Rust

A ferrugon's [[Flesh to Stone]] and [[Wall of Stone]] innate spells result in rusted iron objects instead of stone. Since this iron is rusted and flawed, it shares the same physical statistics as the stone created by the spells themselves and is too low-quality to serve as a source for forging metal objects.
