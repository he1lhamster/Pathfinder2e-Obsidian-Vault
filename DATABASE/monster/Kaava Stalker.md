# Kaava Stalker

Kaava hunting parties can number in the dozens, although they blend easily into the forest and cover all traces of their passage. While community elders assign various tasks to hunting parties, such as recovering food or deterring intruders, the parties are expected to accomplish these tasks as they see fit.
