# Blustering Gale

Blustering gales are among the least of air elementals: spirits of the small breezes who sometimes arise in the wake of mightier creatures, like the downdraft of a swallow's wing or the sharp expulsion of a vigorous cough. Unwilling or unable to act effectively alone, they form into “gales,” collections of weak elementals that use their combined power to hurl insults and pummel those who defy them in a misguided attempt to rise above their humble origins.
 Together, they force other creatures to do their bidding, then move on when they grow bored. While most gales claim their abandoned minions were useless, in truth, blustering gales lack the commanding presence and confidence to retain vassals for long.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bullying Bluster** (auditory, aura, emotion, mental, linguistic) 30 feet. The blustering gale constantly unleashes a tirade of insults and aggressive taunts. Each enemy who enters or starts their turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for as long as they remain within the aura (stupefied 2 on a critical failure). The troop's members are collectively able to mimic a few curse words or insults in every language, allowing their Bullying Bluster to affect any creature who understands a language. A creature who succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 hour. The blustering gale can activate or deactivate the aura with a free action, which has the concentrate trait.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Troop Defenses|Troop Defenses]]** </span>

This windstorm is a 10-foot burst within 100 feet that deals 3d8+10 bludgeoning damage (DC 30 basic Reflex save). Creatures that fail their saving throw are pushed 10 feet in any direction (plus knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] on a critical failure). When the troop is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst and the distance pushed decreases to 5 feet.</span>

###  Lackeys

Blustering gales sometimes serve as heralds or enforcers for other creatures (including cloud dragons, jaathooms, and other powerful air elementals), bullying and intimidating others at the behest of a more influential overlord. While blustering gales often feel secure and confident in these roles, they rankle at subservience, and rarely feel content with such an arrangement for long.
