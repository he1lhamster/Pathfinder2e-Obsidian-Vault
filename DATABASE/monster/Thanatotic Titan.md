# Thanatotic Titan

Thanatotic titans served as assassins in the war against the deities. They learned to sever their targets' divine connections, murdering mortal priests and divine heralds alike. Thanatotic titans were locked away in the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]], but some have freed themselves and crept out from the Abyss so they might continue their sprees of murder and mayhem. To this day, they seek out the faithful for slaughter.
