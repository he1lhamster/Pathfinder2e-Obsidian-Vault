# Shoony Hierarch

For all their advancement in agriculture, horticulture, and animal husbandry, shoonies subscribe to a remarkably antiquated form of leadership; the role of hierarch is normally inherited, passed on to the oldest living child of the village’s previous hierarch. In the instance that the village’s hierarch does not produce an heir, the village holds a general election. Elected hierarchs hold the term for life and are just as highly regarded as hierarchs raised from birth. When the settlement comes under attack, it is up to the hierarch to decide when to fight and when to flee. In most cases, shoonies prefer to elect individuals with a preference toward the latter.

A signal arrow cannot be used to deal damage. Hierarchs carry a number of different arrows that signal different things; a red signal arrow might mean retreat, whereas a green arrow might be a call to gather in the village commons.</span>
