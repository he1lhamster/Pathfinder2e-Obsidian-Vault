# Kizidhar

The genies of the [[Plane of Wood]], known as the kizidhars, are overbearing lords of their element. These master crafters of wood specialize in carpentry and all kinds of woodcarving, and they take a particular delight in reshaping the world in their own image—either through creating wooden statues of themselves or by manipulating and controlling the living things around them. Though they're able to carve themselves similarly, they usually regard their own forms as perfect.
 Shunning the company of other genies, they prefer to avoid those equal in power and instead surround themselves with circles of sycophants and flatterers. With the pathways to the [[Material Plane]] open again for the first time in ages, kizidhars roam the multiverse to find mortals they can tempt into joining their palace retinues as servants, entertainers, and valuable sources of new information.
Kizidhars look like walking trees, averaging 10 to 12 feet tall with branches twisting to form their arms, faces, and other features. A kizidhar can reshape their body to create any wooden object.

###  Patrons of Art

Kizidhars are great patrons and beings to introduce into a campaign using nature crafting rules. They are proud, vain, and happy to show off their superiority by creating wooden weapons and armor for those who perform a service for them. Kizidhars always seek to gain the upper hand in such deals, however, and PCs exchanging services for kizidhar goods should do so with the knowledge that a kizidhar rarely makes a deal if they don't believe they're getting the better side of the bargain.
