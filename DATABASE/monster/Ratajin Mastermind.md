description: 'Most commonly found in Vudra and Jalmeray, ratajin aren''t so much twisted
  by curses as they are molded by the lingering effects of curses inflicted on generations
  millennia past. The difference lies in understanding the original ratajin characteristics.
  No curse gave ratajin four eyes on a slender face, nor triple-jointed, hypermobile
  legs and multiple arms. Nor did curses provide ratajin with skin tones of all hues
  within the color spectrum. Instead, these residual curses have given each ratajin
  distinctive geometric markings all across their body. Every ratajin also experiences
  a cursed twist on their senses, altering how they view and interact with the world
  around them. Some ratajin visualize the world in shifted, indescribable color spectra.
  For others, sounds physically manifest as feelings on their skin. Haunting melodies
  of past actions might whisper in the wind behind one ratajin, while another can

  manifestations are passed along family lines, each ratajin''s worldview can offer
  a unique perspective. Ratajin tend to be receptive to new ideas, making them well-suited
  to tackle complex situations. They often prefer to focus on difficult problems,
  working without rest until they reach a solution. What satisfies the definition
  of a worthy pursuit varies with individual ratajin, from tinkering with new applications
  of technology to uncovering secrets of centuries-old magical tomes. Their intellectual
  approach to problems can make ratajin especially useful in situations requiring
  delicate words, and their quick thinking serves them well as adventurers when the
  time comes for action. These same characteristics also make them capable merchants
  and scholars.<br/><br/> Earning a ratajin''s trust can prove difficult. Their large-scale
  communities often collaborate to devise clever solutions that ensure equitable treatment
  among people, but each community varies greatly due to the different needs of the
  inhabitants. Outsiders who require too much help too quickly might cause a ratajin
  to withdraw, believing their guest incapable of adjusting to life''s many hurdles.
  Poorly chosen words of pity or meaningless sympathy toward the nature of a ratajin''s

# Ratajin

Most commonly found in Vudra and Jalmeray, ratajin aren't so much twisted by curses as they are molded by the lingering effects of curses inflicted on generations millennia past. The difference lies in understanding the original ratajin characteristics. No curse gave ratajin four eyes on a slender face, nor triple-jointed, hypermobile legs and multiple arms. Nor did curses provide ratajin with skin tones of all hues within the color spectrum. Instead, these residual curses have given each ratajin distinctive geometric markings all across their body. Every ratajin also experiences a cursed twist on their senses, altering how they view and interact with the world around them. Some ratajin visualize the world in shifted, indescribable color spectra. For others, sounds physically manifest as feelings on their skin. Haunting melodies of past actions might whisper in the wind behind one ratajin, while another can be awake only during hours devoid of sunlight.
 While particular curse manifestations are passed along family lines, each ratajin's worldview can offer a unique perspective. Ratajin tend to be receptive to new ideas, making them well-suited to tackle complex situations. They often prefer to focus on difficult problems, working without rest until they reach a solution. What satisfies the definition of a worthy pursuit varies with individual ratajin, from tinkering with new applications of technology to uncovering secrets of centuries-old magical tomes. Their intellectual approach to problems can make ratajin especially useful in situations requiring delicate words, and their quick thinking serves them well as adventurers when the time comes for action. These same characteristics also make them capable merchants and scholars.
 Earning a ratajin's trust can prove difficult. Their large-scale communities often collaborate to devise clever solutions that ensure equitable treatment among people, but each community varies greatly due to the different needs of the inhabitants. Outsiders who require too much help too quickly might cause a ratajin to withdraw, believing their guest incapable of adjusting to life's many hurdles. Poorly chosen words of pity or meaningless sympathy toward the nature of a ratajin's unique sensory experience can also cause lingering resentment.

###  A Peculiar Exception

Jalmeray's stigma toward curses and the cursed leads some outsiders to wonder why ratajins, who are supposedly marked by the aftereffects of such dire magic, are held in esteem. Most natives of Niswan find the question nonsensical, insisting ratajins aren't cursed, though the Curse Shepherds of the nation are known to be less discerning on the distinction when it comes to other peoples.
