# Spring-Heeled Jack

The greatest secret of the murderous trickster known as Spring-Heeled Jack is that he isn't a unique creature. Instead, he's one of a rare type of fey native to the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]] who enjoy causing bloody mayhem in the Material Plane. These fey are so rare and so distrustful of one another's company that two have never been seen together; the mistaken assumption that only a single Spring-Heeled Jack exists is therefore entirely understandable. The fact that sightings occur across Ustalav (and beyond) and across centuries of time is ascribed to the trickster's long lifespan and mysterious ability to travel quickly, or to the belief that there's no such creature, merely an urban legend that twisted minds attempt to bring to life through costumes, magic, and a series of murders and mayhem. Even in fear-drenched Ustalav, no one has yet guessed that multiple Spring-Heeled Jacks exist or postulated that some future event might drive them to overcome their mutual disdain and gather into a murderous cabal, far more powerful than the sum of its parts.

### Greater Jacks

Spring-Heeled Jack isn't unique, and more powerful versions of these malevolent terrors certainly exist. Adding one or two of the following abilities to Spring-Heeled Jack, along with the elite adjustment, is the fastest way to create a greater Spring-Heeled Jack. You can also add one of these abilities to an ordinary Spring-Heeled Jack to distinguish them from others, hinting to the players that more than one of these wicked creatures exist.

### Gentleman's Guise

Some greater Spring-Heeled Jacks can take on a magical disguise to pass more easily among commonfolk.
 [[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) Spring-Heeled Jack takes on the appearance of a Medium humanoid dressed in exquisite finery. This doesn't change his Speed or his attack and damage modifiers with his Strikes. When in this form, Spring-Heeled Jack gains a [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] modifier equal to his [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] modifier.

### Resonant Terror

Instead of merely startling foes with his appearance, a greater Spring-Heeled Jack can plant his terrifying visage deep in a target's subconscious. This ever-present reminder of his ghastly face echoes long after in the mind. This ability replaces Frightful Presence. **Resonant Terror** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, curse, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, primal) Spring-Heeled Jack glares at a creature he can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a Will save (DC equal to the DC of Jack's Breath Weapon) or become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]] (frightened 2 on a critical failure), and it can't reduce its frightened condition below 1 for 24 hours or until this curse is removed. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to this ability for 24 hours.

### Vanishing Leap

A greater Spring-Heeled Jack can disappear into thin air just as soon as he touches down after a mighty leap.
 **Vanishing Leap** <span class="action-icon">4</span> (illusion, primal) **Trigger** Spring-Heeled Jack uses Vault; **Effect** Spring-Heeled Jack becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] for 1 round.
