<span class="in-box-ability">**[[Form Up]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> </span><span class="in-box-ability">**Hurl Javelins!** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The troop's members throw a volley of javelins. Each creature in a 10-foot burst within 30 feet of the troop takes 2d6+10 piercing damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save). When the troop is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Lower Spears!** <span class="action-icon">1</span> to <span class="action-icon">3</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The skeletons engage in a coordinated longspear attack against each enemy within 10 feet (DC 27 basic Reflex save). The damage depends on the number of actions.

The troop Strides in a straight line until they're adjacent to an enemy then use Lower Spears!, dealing 3d8+8 piercing damage. Any creature that fails its save is also knocked [[Prone]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Troop Movement** Whenever the skeleton infantry Stride, they first [[Form Up]] as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the infantry enter difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to all the guards.</span>
