  Mischievous and playful, these raccoon-headed humanoids love to socialize with mortals

  starts off dark russet in color, giving way to gray and white flecks on their muzzles

  They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community,
  often appearing as someone''s trusted mentor to deliver an important message in
  a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They''re not
  above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they''ve assumed,
  especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson. Raccoon agathions prefer

###  Procyals and Societies

While born from the souls of the enlightened like other agathions, procyals derive their core value of whimsy from truly understanding the delicate balance between society and the individual. These clever celestials prefer enabling communities under attack to extinguish the evil threats and thrive on their own.
