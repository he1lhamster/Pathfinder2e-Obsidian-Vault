# Giant Leech

Capable of growing to lengths of nearly 5 feet, giant leeches have circular maws filled with hook-like teeth. They prefer to dwell in stagnant or slow-moving shallow water or in damp, moist undergrowth. Horses and larger animals are their favorite prey, but they won't balk at a chance to latch onto a human- or halfling-sized meal.
