# Elder Thing

The typical elder thing is a scientist first and anything else second, but they don't hesitate to use force to achieve their needs or defend their laboratories. When one does deign to speak to a non-elder thing, it's either out of fear (for a creature they know vastly outstrips their own power) or with an insufferable sense of narcissistic superiority and impatience, like how an arrogant professor might speak to a student struggling with what they perceive to be a simple concept.

While hibernating, an elder thing is unconscious. The elder thing can remain in hibernation as long as it wishes—while hibernating, it doesn't need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a hibernating elder thing. Any effect that would normally rouse an unconscious creature can end an elder thing's hibernation, but the elder thing must attempt a DC 25 Will save. On a success, the elder thing awakens in 2d4 rounds; otherwise it takes 1d4 days to wake from hibernation. The elder thing can set the length of its hibernation when it enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening in this way, the elder thing does so in only 1d4 rounds, with no Will save necessary.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Unnatural Flight** The elder thing's wings allow it to fly in regions where flight is normally impossible, such as outer space. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to checks made to [[Maneuver in Flight]], and on saving throws against effects that impede flight.</span>
