# Dread Wraith

These menacing spiritual remnants of wicked warlords or bloodthirsty generals are towering specters of shadow and death. Like other wraiths, dread wraiths haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel greater distances to sow terror or amass influence, often sticking to dark glades or sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths. A particularly powerful necromancer might compel packs of dread wraiths into service, however, while a particularly malevolent goal—such as to eradicate a bastion of light and life—might draw several dread wraiths together in a common purpose.

The target wraith dissolves and streaks toward the dread wraith in a straight line, dealing 6d10 negative damage to each creature along the line (DC 28 basic Fortitude save). The dread wraith absorbs the essence of the target wraith, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] and gaining a +10-foot status bonus to its fly Speed for a number of rounds equal to the level of the absorbed wraith. It can use its extra action only to Fly or Strike.

Further damage dealt by the wraith increases the drained condition value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wraith Spawn** (divine, necromancy) A living humanoid slain by a wraith's spectral hand Strike rises as a wraith spawn after 1d4 rounds. This wraith spawn is under the command of the dread wraith that killed it. It doesn't have drain life or wraith spawn. If the creator of the wraith spawn dies, the wraith spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous wraith; it regains its free will and gains drain life and wraith spawn.</span>

###  Dread Wraith Origins

The most unusual dread wraiths are those that coalesce from an amalgamation of evil spirits, often in regions where such spirits are shredded from their consciousnesses and churned in foci of negative energy, such as the [[DATABASE/plane/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]] or on the Isle of Terror.
