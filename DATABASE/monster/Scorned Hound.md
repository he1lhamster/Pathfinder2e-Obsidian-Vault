A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (plus [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|slowed 1]] for as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
