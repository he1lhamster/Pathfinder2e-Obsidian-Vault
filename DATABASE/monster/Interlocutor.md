# Interlocutor

Interlocutors are the most talented surgeon-sculptors of the velstracs, carving away flesh and replacing it with new body parts of muscle, sinew, and metal. Each interlocutor structures their individual appearance carefully, but all are towering, multi-limbed amalgamations of the strongest limbs, densest bone, and sharpest metal they can find. They continually search for new material to graft to their forms, and their slain foes are rarely found intact, as little is more valuable to interlocutors than a powerful opponent's legs, eyes, or even brain. Interlocutors average 9 feet tall and weigh approximately 800 pounds.

The creature must immediately attempt a Will save against Glimpse of Stolen Flesh. In addition, if the creature was already [[Stunned]], on a failed save, it feels its internal organs twist and writhe, and is [[Clumsy]] for 1 minute.
