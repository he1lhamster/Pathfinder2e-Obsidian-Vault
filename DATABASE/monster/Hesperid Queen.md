# Hesperid Queen

Hesperid queens rule over isolated regions soaked in the light of sunset. They guard countless treasures and secrets, though for those who approach them with respect and offer an intriguing bargain, they're willing to part with knowledge or items beyond those secrets or valuables they've sworn to keep to themselves.
 Hesperid queens are relatively likely to have powerful objects under their protection, such as ancient relics or artifacts. As such, they're keenly aware of the danger posed by unscrupulous treasure hunters seeking to obtain these items at any cost, and they use their incredible minds to set up devious countermeasures to protect their wards, even in the event of their own deaths.

**Tied to the Land** A hesperid queen is intrinsically tied to an isolated region such as an island or island chain, a remote coast, or a secluded valley. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the hesperid queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals that would harm the environment, such as [[Blight]], with a +37 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 10. When the hesperid queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, their warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the hesperid queen swiftly heals the entire region.

<span class="in-box-ability">**[[Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Hesperid queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a version of their natural form that more closely resembles a humanoid.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Create Golden Apple** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (primal, transmutation) While the hesperid queen is within their bonded location, they can spin golden light around an object they're holding of up to 20 cubic feet in volume and up to 80 Bulk. Doing so condenses the object into a magic apple made of golden light with light Bulk. The golden apple reverts back to its original shape after a full day away from the hesperid queen's bonded location, or when the hesperid queen spends a single action (which has the concentrate trait) to end the effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Focus Beauty** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual) The hesperid queen focuses their beauty upon a target within their aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the queen's beauty aura; a target that wasn't already affected by the aura becomes overwhelmed with visions of bliss and beauty. The creature departs from the hesperid queen's domain as quickly and efficiently as it can for 1 hour, after which time it forgets ever reaching the hesperid queen's domain, how it did so, and everything that happened while it was within the domain.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Inspiration** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A hesperid queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of their favor, typically a lock of their hair. As long as the creature carries the token and remains in good standing with the hesperid queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all [[Crafting]] checks, [[Performance]] checks, and Will saves.
 If a hesperid queen grants their Inspiration to a [[Bard]] and they are that bard's muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for [[Enigma]], the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all [[Lore]] checks; for [[Maestro]], the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for [[Polymath]], the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.</span>

###  Draconic Rapport

Hesperid queens and [[Dragon, Gold]] have an unusual affinity, sometimes working together to guard treasure. The queen might guard such valuables as part of their ward, even as the dragon sees them as their hoard. The competing viewpoints don't bother either party, and such alliances can last millennia.
