###  Jinx Eaters

In the pirate-controlled archipelago of the Shackles, tengus occupy a unique social niche, since many pirates believe that a tengu’s presence on board a ship wards off bad luck. Known as “jinx eaters,” these tengu are treated as mascots by their pirate crews. Jinx eaters don’t mind this treatment, however, since it allows them to escape much of the drudgery associated with working on a ship. When a tengu is sailing with pirates afraid of ill fortune, the claim that “hunger leads to bad luck” secures comfort and respect for the jinx eater more effectively than any bribe.
