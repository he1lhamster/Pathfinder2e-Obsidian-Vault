# Love Siktempora

Acts of great and intense love spawn love siktemporas, kindly creatures bearing intense strength that start and end wars in the name of the love that birthed them. These adept combatants form crossbows and bolts out of their emotional bonds, though they typically fight only to protect that which they love. While unable to speak given their featureless faces, they're nevertheless compassionate listeners and savvy communicators.
 Each love siktempora takes the form of two small humanoids conjoined at the hip with three legs, two arms, and two heads. Their faces are completely featureless except for a faint, ever present blush spread across their cheeks, and they always appear garbed in stylish garments from obscure civilizations.

**Telepathic Singer** A love siktempora can provide verbal components and auditory performances for their composition spells even though they can't speak. They do so without needing to make noise, as all creatures within range of their telepathy hear the components in their mind. However, the siktempora can do so only as long as at least one other creature with an Intelligence modifier of +0 or higher is within the range of their telepathy.
**Temporal Sense** A siktempora can always roll Dimension of Time Lore for initiative. When it does, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the roll.
