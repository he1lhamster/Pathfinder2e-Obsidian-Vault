# Giant, Smog

Corrupting magical storms and the interference of unethical gearsmiths birthed the first of the so-called smog giants. These hot-tempered behemoths all originate from a clan of unfortunate [[DATABASE/monster/Hill Giant|hill giants]] which became so attuned to their strange environment they developed unique mutations and incredibly violent dispositions. For all their physical abnormalities, it's still fair to say the violent confrontations common along the Western Ravage are the true cause of smog giants' monstrous nature.
 Smog giants can eat meat and bone, but they prefer diets of [[DATABASE/equipment/Black Powder|black powder]] and the raw materials that make up this alchemical concoction. Their bodies store repositories of the stuff infused with the unstable occult energies that lace their flesh, granting them the ability to “crack” these pockets of subdermal explosives when they attack, much like a tough cracking their knuckles during a fight. In this case however, the results are much more violent—especially when coupled with the large quantities of weaponized body piercings and adornments smog giants often wear.

###  Brow Beating

Smog giants are fond of smashing their craniums together to establish dominance, under the logic that whoever's the strongest is usually right, with the first giant knocked prone being declared the loser. This simple ritual is used to determine rank, settle disputes, impress a mate, or even as a greeting between friends. Smog giant arguments are explosive, loud, violent, short, and sometimes fatal.
