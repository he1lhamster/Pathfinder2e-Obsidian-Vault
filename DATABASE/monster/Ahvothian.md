# Ahvothian

Ahvothians are feral and cunning fiends from an [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyssal]] realm of jungles, dinosaurs, and relentless brutality. They resemble humanoid [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dinosaur|dinosaurs]] with narrow, fanged heads similar to raptors and solid, heavy legs like sauropods. Relentless trackers and survivalists, ahvothians are skilled at navigating jungles and are most commonly encountered stalking prey or operating out of fortified ruins. Ahvothians have an uncanny affinity with reptiles, and they often use dinosaurs—particularly carnivores such as allosauruses or [[DATABASE/monster/Deinonychus|deinonychuses]]—as hunting companions or guard animals. Although dangerous in large groups, ahvothians have such a strong desire to assert dominance over others that ahvothian armies frequently fall to infighting and bloody battles for dominance within days, or even hours. The mightiest ahvothians might lead dozens of their kin and herds of carnivorous dinosaurs.

Their weapon Strikes against creatures of that type deal an additional 1d10 damage and they gain a +2 status bonus on [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks against creatures of that type. The ahvothian doesn't lose these bonuses if they lose the trophies. Once per day, an ahvothian can change the creature type of their wicked trophies in a ritual that takes 1 hour. Nearly all ahvothians encountered on the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] have selected humanoids as the focus of their wicked trophies.</span>

###  Hunters of Ahvoth-Kur

The realms of the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] are vast, and most have complex ecosystems that supplement, or even predate, the demons that lair within them. The Abyssal realm of Ahvoth-Kor is the jungle-covered domain of the demon lord of strength and tyranny, [[DATABASE/deity/Angazhan|Angazhan]]. But Ahvoth-Kor had life before Angazhan came to rule it, and the smartest of these creatures were the cunning hunters called ahvothians. Today, the ahvothians are fully subjugated by the Ravenous King and serve him faithfully in Ahvoth-Kor and beyond.
