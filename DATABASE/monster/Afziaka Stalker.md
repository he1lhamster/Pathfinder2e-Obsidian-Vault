**Grave-Bound Guts** (divine, transmutation) While within 100 feet of its [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire, Vrykolakas|vrykolakas's]] burial ground, an afziaka appears in the natural shape it had when it was a regular animal and can eat normally. When farther away, it doesn't gain sustenance from eating food and eventually starves to death.
