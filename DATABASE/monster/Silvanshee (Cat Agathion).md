# Silvanshee (Cat Agathion)

Silvanshees are a stealthy and extremely inquisitive contingent of agathions who gather information about the mortal world for other agathions. While they love to explore the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] and sate their curiosity, they're generally reclusive and skittish. These dual instincts war with each other whenever something exciting piques their interest. Because of their small sizes, they don't pose a combat threat to most creatures; instead, silvanshees act as [[DATABASE/plane/Nirvana|Nirvana's]] eyes and ears in the mortal world, reporting back to superiors or calling for help should they run into danger.
 Silvanshees appear indistinguishable from domestic felines, save for their violet eyes and the telltale blaze of differently colored fur on their chests. Of course, flying gives them away outright, so if at all possible, they only do so while in trusted company to avoid detection.
 Their fur color runs the spectrum of normal feline colorations. They can also transform into mist when necessary to maintain discretion or make a hasty getaway.

###  Silvanshee Allies

Silvanshees will work with heroes who remain patient with their curiosity and skittishness. They're inquisitive, alternating between affection and aloofness. They do what they can to aid and defend their companions, but their strong sense of self-preservation means they'll likely flee if they sense they can't win a fight.
