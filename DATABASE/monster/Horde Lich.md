# Horde Lich

At first glance, a horde lich looks like a skeleton packed with too many bones. In combat, the true purpose of these extra parts becomes clear as limbs peel off, expanding and reassembling into another nimble skeletal form. Regardless of the number, the single lich mind controls them all, and if any of them survive an encounter, they can rebuild the whole given enough time and raw materials.

## Creating A Horde Lich

A horde lich trades frightful presence, Drain Soul Cage, and paralyzing touch for the servitor abilities listed below and the Shatter Block reaction.
**Recall Knowledge - Undead ([[Religion]])**: DC 39
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 37

<span class="in-box-ability">**Servitor Assembly** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate) A horde lich has three servitor bodies folded up and attached to themself, usually in the ribcage, on the arms, and around the legs. The lich detaches one of these servitors and places it in any open, adjacent space. The lich can alternatively take this action to reattach an adjacent servitor.
 The lich and their servitors share actions and Hit Points, and the servitors use the same statistics as the lich. Spells and effects that target the lich or their servitors affect all of them equally, but they're still treated as just one creature when targeted by spells and attacks. The horde lich attempts only one save against such effects, but they take a –2 circumstance penalty to defend against effects that target both the lich and one or more detached servitors. Whenever the horde lich Casts a Spell, they can choose to have the spell originate from themself or from any one of their detached servitors. If the horde lich is destroyed, all attached servitors are destroyed as well. If a servitor is dealt a critical hit, it's destroyed (and the horde lich takes the damage as normal).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Servitor Attack** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate) Each of the horde lich's detached servitors Strike, with a –2 circumstance penalty on the attack roll. Each of these Strikes counts toward the lich's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Servitor Lunge** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** The horde lich's last action was a critical hit with a melee Strike, and the horde lich has at least one servitor attached; **Effect** One of the lich's attached servitors detaches adjacent to the target, and the target is [[Grabbed]] by that servitor.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Servitor Realignment** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate) Each of the horde lich's detached servitors can either Interact or take a basic action with the move trait. The lich chooses which action each of them takes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Steady Spellcasting** If a reaction would disrupt the horde lich's spellcasting action, the lich attempts a DC 15 flat check. On a success, the action isn't disrupted.</span>
