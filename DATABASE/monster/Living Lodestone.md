# Living Lodestone

This rotating sphere of dark, shiny metal floats about 5 feet off the ground, constantly surrounded by a whirling frenzy of smaller metallic objects caught up in its powerful magnetic field.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Magnetic Field** (aura, metal, primal) 60 feet. A living lodestone constantly emits a powerful magnetic field that is either positively or negatively aligned. Each creature within the aura that is wielding a metallic weapon, wearing metallic armor, or made partially or entirely out of metal is subject to an effect determined by the lodestone's current polarity.

* **Negative** An affected creature is pushed 5 feet away from the lodestone at the start of each of its turns, and it treats each square in the aura as difficult terrain when moving closer to the lodestone. Unattended metal objects in the aura of 2 Bulk or less are pushed just outside the aura.
* **Positive** An affected creature is pulled 5 feet toward the lodestone at the start of each of its turns, and it treats each square in the aura as difficult terrain when moving farther from the lodestone. Unattended metal objects in the aura of 2 Bulk or less are pulled adjacent to the lodestone.

</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Electromagnetic Disruption** When living lodestone takes electricity damage, they automatically reverses polarity.</span>

###  Lodestone Loot

The cyclone of metallic objects constantly orbiting a living lodestone often contains items of value, ranging from simple coinage and bits of precious metal to long-lost weapons, jewelry, and sometimes even enchanted metal trinkets. The lodestone itself has no concept of the value of such things, and is just as likely to fling one of these valuable items at a foe as it is any other object.
