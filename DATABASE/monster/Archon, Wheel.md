# Archon, Wheel

Among the most terrifying archons to behold, and easily the most difficult for mortals to comprehend, is the wheel archon, so named for its appearance as a flying, armor-plated wheel of fire with eyes on each spoke. Wheel archons often serve as messengers or harbingers for the armies of heaven, as their stubborn, indomitable natures make them ill-suited for missions requiring diplomacy or tact. Indeed, they have a legendary intolerance and single-mindedness in the pursuit of the punishment of evil.
 Wheel archons can't tolerate deceit and easily see through lies. The sensation of this celestial being's divine eyes all fixing upon a single target is usually enough to encourage honesty, but when a wheel archon detects a falsehood, their righteous wrath takes over and they mete out punishment to sinners without quarter.

The target must immediately attempt a DC 37 Will save against the wheel archon's all-knowing eyes. If the creature is under any magical effect that disguises it or has altered its shape, the wheel archon attempts to counter that magical disguise effect (counteract +29, 8th level). After attempting its save, the creature is then temporarily immune until the start of the wheel archon's next turn.</span>

###  Unforgiving Archons

More so than other archons, the wheel archon's view of good and evil is rigid, almost to the point of absolute inflexibility. They carry out other celestials' instructions to the letter—sometimes in ways that incur grave consequences when they're faced with situations that would be served better with moderation and forgiveness. A wheel archon never regrets or feels remorse for their actions, as they see themself as an arbiter of heavenly law.
