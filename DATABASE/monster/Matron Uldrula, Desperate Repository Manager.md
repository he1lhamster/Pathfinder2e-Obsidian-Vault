# Matron Uldrula, Desperate Repository Manager

For eons, Uldrula served as would any [[DATABASE/monster/Shoki|shoki]] in [[DATABASE/deity/Ra|Pharasma's]] court, escorting wayward souls to the [[DATABASE/plane/Boneyard|Boneyard]] for judgment. Though she used logic and emotional arguments whenever possible, she relied upon her staff and powerful magic to forcefully capture souls when words failed. Uldrula would've remained on this path if not for her devotion to [[DATABASE/deity/Narakaas|Narakaas]], the Cleansing Sentence.
 In time, Uldrula entered Narakaas's service, working as an archivist and later manager at a small soul repository located on the borders of Narakaas's realm: Reprieve. While there, Uldrula cataloged not only the souls in Reprieve's care but also the reason for their arrival. The endeavor sparked a change in the old shoki. After eons as a dispassionate arbiter of fate, Uldrula allowed feelings to interfere with her work. She adopted the mantle “Matron,” and the souls became “her wards.” And, the predators that harmed souls became her enemies.
 For millennia, Matron Uldrula lobbied her superior, Arbiter Alcrazaal, to dispatch psychopomp assassins to destroy the most heinous soul predators, but her arguments were regularly written off as rash, emotional, and illogical.
 Sensing her time at Reprieve is nearing its end and desperate to spare countless souls any unnecessary harm, Matron Uldrula has resorted to considering drastic measures to see her enemies destroyed once and for all. During her darkest moments, she has considered traveling the planes to dispatch as many soul predators as she can before Arbiter Alcrazaal catches her and ends her life.
 Matron Uldrula is a hunchbacked shoki with a pearlescent snail-like shell on her back, frazzled gray hair, and the countenance of a wise old woman. Wrinkles and worry line her face, her gap-toothed smile is cunning but kindly, and she has expressive gold eyes—though such affectations are typically feigned among shokis, Matron Uldrula's are genuine. Her gray skin is webbed with scars, which appear as tiny gold lines in irregular patterns like cracks in broken pottery. She leans heavily on an adamantine staff from which dangles a lantern containing a blue-white wisp of light.
 Though she hides it well, Matron Uldrula is weary.

## Campaign Role

Although Matron Uldrula is opposed to the PCs' presence in her soul repository, she has spent eons bargaining with desperate souls and is intrigued enough to allow the PCs to speak in their defense before she reaps their souls.
 If the PCs are honest with Matron Uldrula, Matron Uldrula becomes an ally of the PCs, giving them Balji's soul in exchange for the death of Kemnebi and providing them information on Arbiter Alcrazaal, who she knows will stand against them.
 If the PCs are dishonest, Matron Uldrula becomes a terrifying foe, willing to die in defense of her wards and trusting reinforcements are on the way.

The target must attempt a DC 46 Will save with the following results.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune to Soul Lock.
 **Success** Matron Uldrula's staff tugs at the creature's soul but doesn't trap it. If the creature is living, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]] (or increases its doomed condition by 1). If the creature is a corporeal undead, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]]. If the creature is an incorporeal undead, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]]. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to soul lock for 24 hours.
 **Failure** Matron Uldrula locks the creature's soul in her staff. If the creature is living, it dies. If the creature is a corporeal undead, its body becomes an inanimate corpse. If the creature is an incorporeal undead, it becomes bodily trapped within the staff. While the soul is locked in the staff, the target can't be returned to life or undeath, or rejuvenated through any means, save powerful magic, such as [[DATABASE/spell/Miracle|miracle]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]], or through divine intervention.
