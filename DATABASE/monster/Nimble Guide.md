# Nimble Guide

Nimble spirit guides are small and discreet, using their diminutive size and natural agility to dart from hiding place to hiding place. They tend to be much shyer than other spirit guides, at least initially, preferring to watch nearby mortals from a distance before deciding whether to trust them. When their trust is so earned, nimble spirit guides are often playful and contagiously exuberant. These spirit guides can often be found entertaining lost children with antics until they are rescued or freeing prisoners by stealing keys and picking locks.
 The green monkey is a nimble spirit guide who takes the appearance of a tiny primate with green fur that, on closer inspection, turns out to be fine blades of grass.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bond with Mortal** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (mental, necromancy, primal) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The spirit guide forms a bond with a mortal creature. While the bond exists, the spirit guide's current and maximum Hit Points increase by 10, the spirit guide gains a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the spirit guide and bonded mortal can communicate telepathically as long as they're on the same plane. The spirit guide can be bonded with only one mortal at a time, and can take this action again to end the bond or to form a new bond (which also ends the old bond). The bond ends if the spirit guide or the mortal dies.
 This bond strengthens the spirit guide's connection to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]. While bonded, the spirit guide loses the incorporeal and spirit traits, loses their immunities and resistances, and changes their Strikes to deal the appropriate physical damage (typically piercing or slashing) instead of force damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Bonded Strike** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirements** The spirit guide is currently Bonded with a Mortal; **Effect** The spirit guide makes a jaws Strike. If this attack hits, the bonded mortal can spend their reaction to Strike the same target.</span>
