# Caligni Assassin

Lauded and shunned, caligni assassins often become unwitting pawns in clashes between caligni settlements or between rival factions of caligni society.

###  Shadowfade

Caligni assassins gain their power from an infusion of planar essence directly from the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Netherworld]], which the [[DATABASE/monster/Owb|owb]] help them develop into powerful abilities. This comes at a cost: all caligni assassins eventually succumb to an affliction known as shadowfade. This magical malady causes the caligni's body to painfully warp when concealed in shadows, as the plane's ability to create twisted reflections of reality changes their physical form directly.
 Sometimes a caligni assassin will flee home and strike out on their own to avoid becoming a twisted tool for their greedy leaders. Such freelancers are in high demand for those seeking a fatal solution to their own political problems.
