# Nalfeshnee (Boar Demon)

Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike and form from the souls of avaricious mortals. Few demons understand the inner workings of the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] itself like nalfeshnees, and it's not unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor of the Abyss itself first rather than bow before a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the fleshy realms that birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular significance deep in the plane's secret reaches. A nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos of the Abyss.

If someone is holding or wearing a targeted item, they can keep it from being affected with a successful DC 34 Reflex save. For 1 minute, the affected items glow in nauseating colors. Any non-demon is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 2]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] as long as it holds, wears, or touches a glowing item. Recovering from the sickness requires a successful DC 29 Will save instead of a Fortitude save. Ending the sickness this way ends the slowed condition and makes the creature temporarily immune to Light of Avarice for 24 hours. If the creature removes or drops the item, both conditions end immediately but the creature doesn't become immune to Light of Avarice.</span>

###  Secret Mongers

Nalfeshnees covet knowledge as well as material goods, especially if such information can help satisfy the needs and desires of the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]]. Each nalfeshnee has areas of interest in which they're highly knowledgeable, but before a nalfeshnee reveals a secret, they typically demand a secret of at least equal value in return.
