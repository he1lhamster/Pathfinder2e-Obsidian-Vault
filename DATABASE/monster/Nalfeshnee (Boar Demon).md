description: "Among the smallest breeds of dragon on Golarion, these savage, cunning\
  \ hunters dwell near the oases that dot the inhospitable Narhari Desert in Vudra.\
  \ Land-bound, they scamper across the badlands on four short limbs, their speckled\
  \ brown and yellow bodies blending into the terrain.<br/><br/> Though najra lizards\
  \ live and sleep alone or in mated pairs near their hunting grounds, groups of up\
  \ to two dozen work in unison to hunt. The lowest-ranked members of a najra lizard\
  \ swarm leave their hidden dens to target prey with their parching spit. Once the\
  \ unquenchable thirst caused by their venom drives the creature to the nearby watering\
  \ hole, the entire swarm attacks. Even when unable to overwhelm foes with sheer\
  \ numbers, najra lizards have little interest in fighting fairly. They often use\
  \ their tails to rustle nearby desert scrub, hurl small stones, or otherwise divert\
  \ attention so they can sneak away or attack from hiding.<br/><br/> Najra lizards\
  \ dislike humanoids and humanoid civilization, and they are particularly rankled\
  \ by being called mere \u201Clizards.\u201D They refer to themselves by a [[DATABASE/language/Draconic|Draconic]]\
  \ word that translates roughly to \u201Cswarm dragon.\u201D Like almost all dragons,\
  \ najra lizards covet shiny metals and glittering gems. They typically hide accumulated\
  \ treasures in small holes near where they sleep, and arguments over such caches\
  \ are one of the few things that engender violence among members of the same pack.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Nalfeshnee (Boar Demon)

Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike and form from the souls of avaricious mortals. Few demons understand the inner workings of the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] itself like nalfeshnees, and it's not unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor of the Abyss itself first rather than bow before a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the fleshy realms that birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular significance deep in the plane's secret reaches. A nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos of the Abyss.

###  Secret Mongers

Nalfeshnees covet knowledge as well as material goods, especially if such information can help satisfy the needs and desires of the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]]. Each nalfeshnee has areas of interest in which they're highly knowledgeable, but before a nalfeshnee reveals a secret, they typically demand a secret of at least equal value in return.
