The target must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or take 5d10 mental damage and be [[Stunned]] for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw, Hollow Hush regains the same number of Hit Points and Feed on Emotion does not cost Hollow Hush an action, allowing it to use another action this turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rapid Strikes** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Hollow Hush attempts three claw Strikes, each against a different target within reach.

Hollow Hush can immediately end a single emotion effect from which the triggering creature is benefiting.</span>
