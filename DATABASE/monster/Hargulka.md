# Hargulka

Before his dreams were invaded and his ambitions enhanced by [[DATABASE/monster/Nyrissa|Nyrissa's]] eldritch manipulations, Hargulka had already established himself as a leader among trollkind, though his goals never reached beyond bullying his fellow [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Troll|trolls]] into rampaging the immediate environs for food and wealth to bring back to him as offerings. The notion of becoming a “king” never crossed his mind until he had a vivid, unforgettable dream of himself sitting atop a throne and basking in the fear and adoration of not only trolls, but [[DATABASE/ancestry/Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]], [[DATABASE/monster/Harpy|harpies]], and all manner of slavering monsters—creatures who might be viewed as dangerous enemies but, to Hargulka, were now his loyal minions.
 To Hargulka, the PCs' kingdom is rightfully his own. He intends to conquer them, claim their capital for himself, and dine on the flesh and bones of their citizens. Yet despite these violent goals, the troll knows better than to simply attack his enemies mindlessly. Instead, he spends his time working with his loyal trolls to seek out like-minded monsters in the wilds to recruit them to his cause. As a result, the longer Hargulka remains in power, the more dangerous and aggressive the monsters of the Stolen Lands will become!

He attempts an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the Reflex DC of an opponent who has Raised a Shield before making a jaws Strike against the opponent. If the Athletics check succeeds, the shield is not considered raised against the jaws Strike. On a critical success, Hargulka pulls the shield out of position, so it is no longer raised until the opponent Raises the Shield again. This counts as two attacks toward Hargulka's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the jaws Strike.</span>
