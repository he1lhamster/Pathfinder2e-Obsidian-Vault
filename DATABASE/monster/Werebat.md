# Werebat

Werebats form organized colonies of opportunistic hunters. They aren't shy about transforming creatures to add to their colony, whom they initiate with elaborate social ceremonies and bloody hazing. The curse of the werebat gives them a strong urge to prey upon on weaker, lonely creatures. True werebats are often unusually tall and thin, with angular features. In combat, werebats favor their unarmed attacks because they can't fly while wielding weapons in their wings.

###  Werebat Colonies

Werebats sometimes methodically curse an entire community to form a terrifyingly large werebat colony. In elaborate covert initiation ceremonies, newly cursed members are given shocking proof of their new monstrous nature and sworn to loyalty and secrecy under threat of exposure or death. Since they're easily mistaken for [[Vampire]], these werebats sometimes warn new werebats to avoid such things as direct sunlight in order to confuse monster hunters or lull foes into a false sense of understanding.
