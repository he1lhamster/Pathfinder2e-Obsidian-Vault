###  Sand Mummification

To keep from eating or drinking during mummification, prophets of Set grafted metal helmets to their bodies shaped like the heads of sha, sleek beasts that were a symbol of [[DATABASE/deity/Set|Set's]] religion. Through slits in their masks, the prophets consumed alchemically treated sands, which absorbed moisture, caused organ failure, and ruptured the stomach to cause death.
