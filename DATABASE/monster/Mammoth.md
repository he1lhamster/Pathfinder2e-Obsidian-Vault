# Mammoth

Found mostly in colder climates, mammoths are accustomed to dealing with desperate and dangerous predators, trampling and crushing their enemies while using their larger tusks to greater effect. Humanoids dwelling in harsh, frost-bound lands rely on the mammoth’s strength to help them survive.
