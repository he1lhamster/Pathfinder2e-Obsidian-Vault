# Stheno Harpist

With living snakes for hair, sthenos, who are descended from [[DATABASE/monster/Medusa|medusas]], are a curious and independent ancestry. A newly emergent people, sthenos have existed for just barely over a century. Only a few generations have passed since their genesis, and some adult sthenos remember members of the original generation. Indeed, since sthenos can live about as long as [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|humans]], a few of the original sthenos might yet live somewhere. As a people without a traditional homeland, sthenos seek to find societies that welcome them, which can be a challenging endeavor. With more than a passing resemblance to medusas, given their ophidian hair and striking features, they find most places are wary if not outright hostile to their presence.

**Snake Search** When the stheno harpist [[DATABASE/action/Search|Searches]] or [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seeks]], their snakes try to help too, rolling a separate Perception check with a modifier of –1 instead of +4. If the snakes notice something, they try to notify the stheno, though they are no more intelligent than normal snakes and might find different things interesting than the stheno does. 
**Speak With Snakes** The stheno harpist can communicate with snakes, including the ones in their hair, and can use [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on snakes and [[DATABASE/action/Request|Request]] things from snakes.
