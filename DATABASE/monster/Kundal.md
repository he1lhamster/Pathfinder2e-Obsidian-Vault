Apply his multiple attack penalty to each Strike normally.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Change Shape** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) Human with fist +16 for 1d4+7 bludgeoning, or wolf with Speed 40 feet and jaws with [[DATABASE/monsterability/Knockdown|Knockdown]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Curse of the Werewolf** (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse affects only humanoids. Saving Throw DC 25 Fortitude save. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into a werewolf until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Moon Frenzy** (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Kundal's moon frenzy functions a bit differently than for typical werecreatures: he doesn't become Large sized, but he does grow much more swift and powerful. His speed increases to 35 feet during moon frenzy and increases the damage of his jaws by +2 (these adjustments are calculated into the stats above). In addition, while in moon frenzy, at the start of his turn, Kundal gains an additional reaction that can be used only to make an Attack of Opportunity.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rip and Drag** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirement** Kundal damaged a target with his jaws Strike with a previous action this round. **Effect** Kundal chews the bitten creature as he attempts to overwhelm them by attempting an Athletics check against the bitten creature's Fortitude DC.
**Critical Success** Kundal inflicts 5d6 piercing damage on the target, exposes them to the curse of the werewolf, and can Stride up to half his speed. If his target is Medium or smaller, he drags the target with him into a new adjacent square.
 **Success Kundal** inflicts 5d6 piercing damage on the target and exposes them to the curse of the werewolf. He can reposition the target up to five feet into an adjacent square.
 **Failure** As success, except only 2d6 piercing damage.
 **Critical Failure** Kundal fails to inflict any damage.</span>
