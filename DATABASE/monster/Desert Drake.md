# Desert Drake

Distant cousins of blue dragons that lack their relatives’ magical talents and intelligence, these desert-dwelling drakes are nonetheless dangerous ambush predators, preying upon isolated desert travelers and outposts for food and supplies. They retain their true-blooded forebears’ resistance to electricity and affinity for sandy environs. Desert drakes’ scales range in coloration from rust-brown to light tan and ocher shades, mimicking the colors of the dunes they call home.
 Desert drakes are among the lightest and most compact of the drakes, though this shouldn’t be mistaken for frailty. Their swooped-back horns and feather-thin wings are adapted to make burrowing as easy as possible. Indeed, a desert drake’s powerful neck makes wriggling through sand and other loose scree as easy as walking for it.
