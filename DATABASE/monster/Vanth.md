# Vanth

Protecting the [[Boneyard]] are the stern and resolute guardians of the dead known as vanths, psychopomps who resemble skeletons with raven-like wings and a mask resembling a vulture's skull. Vanths carry black scythes to fight against those who would disturb the natural progression of souls, and they consider any visitor to the Boneyard a potential troublemaker. When the psychopomp armies go to war, vanths serve as front-line soldiers. They rarely speak and even more rarely show any emotion other than a grim adherence to duty.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Infuse Weapon** (divine, evocation) A vanth's scythe is its symbol of office and gains a measure of its personal power.

The creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save. 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Vanth's Curse for 24 hours. 
**Success** The target feels a momentary shudder of doom and is [[Stupefied]] for 1 minute by the distracting sensation. 
**Failure** The target becomes morose and glum as it accepts its own inevitable fate. For 1 hour, the target is stupefied 2. Each time the target gains the [[Dying]] condition, the stupefied condition value increases by 1, to a maximum value of stupefied 4. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the effect is permanent.</span>

###  Vanth Scythes

Vanths' favored weapon is the [[Scythe]], a choice that even further adds to their fearsome appearance and can lead to unfortunate associations with the [[Grim Reaper]] or [[Urgathoa]] among more superstitious mortals. Vanths find such comparisons to be ignorant at best or insulting at worst. Some vanths infuse their scythes with different qualities, such as [[Cold Iron Weapon]] or [[Silver Weapon]], depending on the nature of their most common enemies.
