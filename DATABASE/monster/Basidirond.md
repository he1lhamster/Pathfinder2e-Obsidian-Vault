# Basidirond

The basidirond, also called a mindfrond, is a fungal creature that crawls about on woody tendrils. The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral-rich moisture—-whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood—-for sustenance. It uses hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs nearly 300 pounds when saturated.

A creature must attempt a new save each round it remains within the area. The cloud persists for 5 rounds unless dispersed before then by a strong wind. Each hallucinating creature rolls 1d6 each round to determine what it hallucinates that round. 
**1 **The target is sinking in quicksand. It falls [[Prone]] and spends 1 action on its next turn flailing its limbs as if attempting to swim. 
**2 **The target is attacked by a swarm of spiders. It spends 2 actions on its next turn attacking the floor with a melee weapon (drawing a weapon if needed). It is [[Flat-Footed]] against all attacks. 
**3 **An item the target is holding turns into a viper. The target [[Release]] the item and spends its next turn fleeing from it. 
**4 **The target is suffocating. It holds its breath and is [[Stunned]]. 
**5** The target shrinks to 1/10 its normal size. For 1 round it is [[Slowed]] and [[Enfeebled]], and takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speed. 
**6** The target is melting. It drops everything it's holding and becomes [[Slowed]] and [[Clumsy]] for 1 round.

###  Harvesting Spores

The psychotropic spores of the basidirond can be harvested with a successful DC 20 [[Lore]] or [[Nature]] check, yielding 1 dose of spores (1d4 doses on a critical success); on a critical failure, the basidirond creates a 10-foot-radius hallucinogenic cloud. Each dose is worth 10 gp for use in [[Crafting]] poisons, or 20 gp if the poison causes the [[Confused]] or [[Stupefied]] condition.
