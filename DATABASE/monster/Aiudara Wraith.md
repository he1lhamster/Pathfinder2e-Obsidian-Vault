# Aiudara Wraith

Dahak’s influence in Alseta’s Landing created a soul-draining effect that slays unprotected creatures within, transforming them into ghostly creatures known as aiudara wraiths, but these rare undead can rise within modern _aiudara _portals as well. Each time an individual travels through an _aiudara_, there’s a chance their passage could leave a faint imprint of their subconscious in the network. Normally this imprint simply fades away, but when an _aiudara _is damaged or the individual is suffering from necromantic contagions, these imprints can accumulate and, in time, coalesce on the Astral Plane or within Alseta’s Landing as a full-fledged aiudara wraith. The wraith is forced to live with an incomplete sense of self, always seeking its own memories and swiftly growing violent and vengeful as its quest to reclaim these ephemeral notions constantly meets with failure.

 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune to dimensional shunt for 1 minute.
 **Success** The creature is pushed 5 feet in a random direction.

 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also [[Stunned]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drain Life** (arcane, necromancy) When an aiudara wraith damages a living creature with its spectral hand Strike, the aiudara wraith gains 18 temporary Hit Points and the target must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or become [[Drained]] and [[Stupefied]] as long as it is drained. Further damage dealt by the aiudara wraith’s spectral hand Strikes increases the value of the [[Drained]] and [[Stupefied]] conditions by 1 each on a failed save, to a maximum of 10 for both.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Instantaneous Movement** (arcane, conjuration, teleportation) An aiudara wraith moves by means of localized teleportation. An aiudara wraith’s Stride does not have the move trait. When an aiudara wraith Strides, it reaches its destination within the range of its Speed immediately.</span>

###  Draining Memories

Aiudara wraiths hunger for memories that they feel they once owned but, in fact, never had at all. Their life-draining touch saps physical and mental energy alike, and those who suffer this effect and become stupefied report feelings of forgetfulness and unnerving incidents of temporary, highly localized amnesia.
