# Demon, Urglid

The hulking monstrosities known as urglids form from the souls of murderous undertakers, sadists who buried their victims alive, and intentionally neglectful grave keepers who gave up their watch over the dead. Standing over 30 feet tall and weighing over 3,000 pounds, the demon's head seems sunken into its torso, and a gaping, toothy mouth opens at the top of its chest.

A creature failing a DC 30 Reflex save is [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]]. The restrained creature then begins sinking below the ground into a spontaneously formed grave. A creature restrained by this ability for three rounds is buried 6 feet deep in the ground and begins suffocating within 1 minute. A buried creature must be dug up to be freed (see Burial). A creature who is slain by Ravenous Earth rises as a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghoul|ghoul]] the next midnight.</span>

###  Kabriri's Excavators

While many loathe urglids for their ravenous appetite for burial and wanton destruction, priests of [[DATABASE/deity/Kabriri|Kabriri]] insist that the demon lord blessed and oversaw their creation, trusting the fiends with digging the labyrinthine network of tunnels that connect Everglut with the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]. It's no surprise, then, that where there's an urglid, there's possibly a pathway to the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]]— and plenty of [[DATABASE/monster/Ghoul|ghouls]].
