# Sluagh Reaper

Most sluagh are reapers: powerful killers subservient to their queen. After they collect souls on a hunt, they dutifully return their plunder to the queen. Though quite clever, they're inscrutable, lacking the whimsy and sociability that characterize many living fey. They do show merriment on occasion though, giggling as their claws draw closer to their quarry's throat.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Ghostly Swoop** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The sluagh reaper becomes incorporeal until the start of their next turn, and [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Flies]] up to their fly Speed. While incorporeal, they are immune to precision damage, and have resistance 10 to all damage (except force, [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]], or positive); this resistance is doubled against non-magical damage. After using Ghostly Swoop, the sluagh reaper can't use it again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]** The sluagh reaper deals an additional 3d6 precision damage to [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] creatures.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Steal Soul** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (necromancy, occult) The sluagh reaper touches a [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]] creature or a creature that died within the past 1 hour. If the target is a dying creature, it must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save—on a failure, its dying value increases by 1 (2 on a critical failure). If the target is dead, it receives no save and the sluagh imprisons its soul in a small, grimy sack that keeps stolen souls fresh.
 The sack is magically locked. Any sluagh can open it without difficulty, but any others must [[DATABASE/action/Pick a Lock|Pick the Lock]] (DC 35) or use [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (5th level; counteract DC 32). A creature can Interact to empty an unlocked sack, which frees the souls but doesn't return them to life. While a soul is imprisoned, it can't be brought back to life by any means short of a [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Miracle|miracle]]. The sack can hold 12 souls at a time. Sluagh reapers typically attempt to return the souls to a [[DATABASE/monster/Queen Sluagh|queen]] so she can devour them.</span>
