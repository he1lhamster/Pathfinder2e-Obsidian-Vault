# Caligni Vanguard

Caligni children born without eyes—an extremely rare occurrence—are considered sacred to their communities. From a young age, they're set aside and groomed to become caligni vanguards, dedicated to rigorous martial training and mental strictures. Other calignis revere vanguards' discipline and combat skill, but wary caution always tinges such respect, as they often have inscrutable motives. Vanguards almost never rebel against their duties or their established role in the community; some claim that those who do are taken by the owbs.
 A vanguard's armor is fused to their body in pieces, and they rarely remove those elements that aren't. This armor plating and vanguards' keen sense of hearing render them particularly sensitive to sonic vibrations, which serves as both an asset and a vulnerability.

###  Vanguard Training

As soon as a caligni vanguard is old enough to hold a weapon, they're immersed in an intensive training regimen that emphasizes austerity, asceticism, and heavy armor prowess. Though initially painful, the fusion of their armor to their bodies serves as a reminder of their responsibilities, and they eventually grow accustomed to the sensation.
