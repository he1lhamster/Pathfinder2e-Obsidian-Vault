# Vishkanya Infiltrator

From a distance, vishkanyas share more than a passing resemblance to humans. However, a closer inspection reveals ophidian eyes with gold or white coloring, a forked tongue, and tiny, smooth scales set in serpentine patterns atop their skin. Even so, most onlookers assume these features to be an indicator of [[DATABASE/ancestry/Tiefling|tiefling]] heritage or draconic magic, never suspecting how truly unusual the subject of their speculation is. Among outsiders, little is known of the vishkanya ancestry other than that a vishkanya carries a potent venom within their blood and saliva, knowledge which has led to widespread fear and distrust. To avoid persecution, vishkanyas entrench themselves deep into their chosen societies and train in the arts of subtlety. Drawn to work that allows them to put their skills to good use, vishkanyas often take the roles of spy, mercenary, bodyguard, and even assassin.

###  Toxicity

Although the idea that vishkanyas are able to administer their venom at a mere touch is a myth, some powerful vishkanyas can concentrate their innate toxins, resulting in more potent venom, or venoms that have different effects.
