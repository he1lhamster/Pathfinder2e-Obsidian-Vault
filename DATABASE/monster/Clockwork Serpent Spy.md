Variant [[DATABASE/monster/Clockwork Spy|clockwork spy]] 
**Perception** +10; low-light vision

**Record Audio <span class="action-icon">1</span> ** The clockwork spy records all sounds within 25 feet onto a small gemstone worth 1 gp embedded in its body. The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound on a single gemstone.
 Once it begins recording, it can't cease recording early, nor can it record onto a gemstone that already contains a recording. Some clockwork spies contain multiple gemstones to allow for a series of recordings. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they must be given simple commands regarding when to start recording sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between different kinds of creatures but not between specific individuals.
 The spy can start or stop playback of recorded sound by spending a single action. Removing a gemstone from or installing a gemstone into a clockwork spy requires a successful DC 14 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]]; on a failure, the gemstone is undamaged, but any recorded sounds are erased and the gemstone still can't be used to make another recording.
**Wind Up** 24 hours, DC 17, standby
