<span class="in-box-ability">**Construct Armor** Like normal objects, an animated silverware swarm has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage the swarm takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an animated silverware swarm is reduced to fewer than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks, removing the Hardness and reducing its Armor Class to 12.</span>

**Speed** 20 feet
<span class="in-box-ability">**Slice and Dice** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (magical) Each enemy in the animated silverware swarm's space takes 1d6 piercing or slashing damage (DC 17 basic Reflex save)</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Stick a Fork in It** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The animated silverware swarm attempts to pin a single creature. The target must attempt a DC 17 Reflex save. 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Success** Silverware pins portions of the target's clothing and gear. The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds as long as it remains in the swarm's space. 
**Failure** As success, and the target also can't Step until it leaves the swarm's space. 
**Critical Failure** The target is thoroughly pinned by the silverware, becoming [[Immobilized]] until it [[Escape]] (DC 17) or uses 2 Interact actions to remove all of the silverware pinning them down.</span>
