# Vrolikai (Death Demon)

Unlike other demons, the dread vrolikai doesn't form from a sinful soul—they instead manifest from a [[Nabasu (Gluttony Demon)]] once the nabasu finally satisfies their hunger and returns to the [[Abyss]], and as such vrolikais suffer from no vulnerability associated with a specific sin. A vrolikai who survives this process and the period of vulnerability that follows gains great power and in time can claim large regions of the Abyss as their own domain. Also known as death demons, these murderous monsters often serve demon lords as executioners or assassins.

###  Vrolikai Newcomers

When vrolikais first manifest on the [[Abyss]], they have no base of power and are, despite their abilities, relatively defenseless from denizens even more powerful than themselves. As a result, most rely upon stealth and patience for their first few centuries while they build up a network of minions and establish their own Abyssal fortifications before they turn their attentions back to the [[Material Plane]].
