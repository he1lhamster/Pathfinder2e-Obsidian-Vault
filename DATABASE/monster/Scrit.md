# Scrit

Scrits are short, spindly gremlins with gray or beige leathery skin and a coat of smeared ink on their fingers. They make themselves the nightmare of many scribes and librarians, as they delight in nothing more than destroying books, scrolls, artwork, and other records or writing. The oils on a scrit's skin smears ink and renders text—even magical writing— completely illegible. Once they have smeared every page of a book, scrits devour them whole, absorbing the contents the book used to hold. After eating books they find stupid or funny, scrits hold skits for other gremlins which mock the mortal authors for the amusement of the other fey.
