# Grothlut

Sluglike abominations, grothluts are fleshwarps that were once humans. While their head and torsos are vaguely human, their arms are rubbery and move awkwardly at their sides. Wretched creatures, they moan piteously when other creatures are near, perhaps as the last remnants of their shattered human consciousness pleads to be free from their horrid warped form.
 Many fleshwarpers consider the grothlut to be a failure of a creation, as the transformation all but stamps out the human consciousness. Others disagree, arguing that warping the creature’s mind makes it all the more useful, since its stupidity makes it pliable and easy to herd. Drow typically use grothluts as guardians that slowly patrol the edges of their enclaves. Once in position, grothluts can be used as crude shock troops, unleashed to soften enemy forces before more-valuable warriors wade in and cut down the enemies who have been nauseated by the grothluts’ exploded organs and flesh.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Disgusting Demise** (acid, poison) When the grothlut is reduced to 0 Hit Points, its digestive organs rupture, unleashing alchemical acid and poison upon all creatures in a 30-foot emanation.

Each non-grothlut creature that enters or starts its turn within the area must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or become sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure). The creature then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute. The grothlut can activate or deactivate the aura by using a single free action that has the concentrate trait. A grothlut usually does not begin moaning until it senses the presence of a non-grothlut creature, and it usually stops once it doesn’t sense any more such creatures.</span>
