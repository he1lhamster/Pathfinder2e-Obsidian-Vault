# Dreadsong Dancer

Dreadsong dancers are shaped from the souls of bards, dancers, and musicians who pledged themselves to [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell]] in exchange for enhanced artistic ability. Fiendish flesh-sculptors twist these forfeited souls so they cannot perform the art that drove them in life—sewing their mouths shut, mutilating their limbs, and grafting serrated scythe-like appendages called songblades. Devils send these warped creatures to torment artists who seem likely to break their infernal contracts, both to mete out punishment and, perversely, to give mortals a glimpse of the fate that awaits their damned souls.

###  Listeners in the Dark

While most dreadsong dancers are dispatched to torment, haunt, slay, or retrieve performers who forfeited the terms of their contracts to [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell]], dreadsong dancers without an immediate mission lurk near taverns and music halls, fixating upon particularly skilled individuals.
