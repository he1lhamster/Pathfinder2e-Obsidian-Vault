# Terrorguard

Spellcasters who harness the power of the [[Dreams Domain]] may use it to fuel vicious servitors known as terrorguards—hulking terrors adorned with frames made of an [[Abysium]] alloy. Terrorguards come in many forms; creators often design the constructs' frames to mimic grotesque aberrations by mixing-and-matching parts.

###  Blades of Terror

A terrorguard's dreamscythes have been carefully forged in the darkest places in the [[Dreams Domain]], causing anyone cut by the blade to see the world around them as if they were trapped in their own worst nightmare. As such, some sinister artisans attempt to repurpose dreamscythe blades as components of new magic weapons. A character who spends two hours and succeeds at a DC 27 [[Crafting]] check can carefully extract the blade without harming it. Should a character fail, the blade crumbles into a choking dust, a swarm of harmless but disgusting insects, or dissolves into an oily fluid. Salvaged dreamscythes are treated as a [[Scythe]] and do not carry along the terrorguard's nightmare essence ability.
