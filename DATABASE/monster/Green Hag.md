# Green Hag

Green hags hate beauty and purity, so they use disguises and treachery to lure and murder innocents, corrupt the pure of heart, and shatter the minds and morals of their victims. Green hags create imaginative schemes to utterly ruin anyone who crosses them, as well as good or righteous folk whose very existence insults the hag’s twisted sensibilities. The complicated scandals perpetuated by green hags involve impersonation, mistaken identity, the seduction and betrayal of loved ones, or all these things in combination.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Betraying Touch** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The green hag touches a creature that doesn’t realize the hag is an enemy. The betrayed creature is affected by the hag’s enfeebling humors and takes a –4 circumstance penalty to their saving throw against that effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The green hag can take on the appearance of any Medium humanoid woman. This doesn’t change her Speed or her attack and damage bonuses with her Strikes, but might change the damage type her Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Enfeebling Humors** (necromancy, occult) A creature damaged by a hag’s claw must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be [[Enfeebled]] for 1 day.

Each living creature in a 15-foot cone is affected by her enfeebling humors (attempting a save as normal). She can’t use Exhale Miasma again for 1d4 rounds.</span>
