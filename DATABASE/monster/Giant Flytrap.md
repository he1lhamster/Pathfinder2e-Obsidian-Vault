###  Flytrap Treasure

Giant flytraps have enough instinctual intellect to effectively ambush prey or to move about to seek out better hunting grounds, but they don’t value treasure. Still, a flytrap tends to accumulate a small wealth of discarded loot from those it has eaten, discarding these shiny baubles in the periphery of its root system once it has finished digesting its meal.
