# Clockwork Sphinx

This imposing construct resembles a bronze lion with the wings of a great bird and the head of a humanoid.
**Recall Knowledge - Construct ([[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]])**: DC 29
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 27
**Specific Lore**: DC 24

<span class="in-box-ability">**Self-Destruct** (arcane, aura, evocation) When a clockwork sphinx is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it collapses and emits a steady ticking sound. At the beginning of what would've been its next turn, the sphinx explodes into a 20-foot emanation of shrapnel, dealing 6d10 piercing damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save). An adjacent creature can cancel the self-destruct sequence by succeeding at a DC 26 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]] at any point before the sphinx explodes, but on a critical failure, it explodes immediately.</span>

###  Other Looks

The clockwork sphinx bears a resemblance to an actual sphinx more out of tradition than any intrinsic requirement. As such, some creators build these creatures to resemble other flying quadrupedal creatures, such as [[DATABASE/monster/Chimera|chimeras]], [[DATABASE/monster/Manticore|manticores]], or even dragons. Regardless of appearance, the clockwork sphinx's statistics remain the same.
