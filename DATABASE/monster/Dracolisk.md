# Dracolisk

Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and [[Basilisk]]. None now know how they first came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its draconic ancestry, though it's lighter on its underside and darker near its wing tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.

This breath weapon deals 6d10 damage of the appropriate type, with a DC 28 basic save of a type indicated in parenthesis below. The dracolisk can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.

That creature must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save. If it fails and has not already been slowed by Petrifying Glance or this ability, it becomes [[Slowed]]. If the creature already was slowed by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a failed save causes the creature to be [[Petrified]] permanently.
A creature petrified in this manner can be instantly restored to flesh by being coated (not just splashed) with fresh dracolisk or basilisk blood no more than 1 hour old. A single dracolisk contains enough blood to coat 1d4+2 Medium creatures in this manner.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Savage Jaws** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The dracolisk makes a single Strike with its jaws. If the attack hits, it deals 4d12+16 piercing damage (versatile S). This counts as two attacks for its multiple attack penalty.</span>

###  Draconic Heritage

A dracolisk's favored dwelling place most closely resembles that of its dragon parent: black dracolisks prefer marshlands, blue dracolisks favor deserts and warm hills, green dracolisks temperate or warm forests, red dracolisks warm mountains and deep caverns, and white dracolisks glaciers and frozen landscapes.
