# Flickerwisp

The dancing, twisting flickerwisp is a less powerful but no less malevolent type of [[DATABASE/monster/Will-o’-Wisp|will-o'-wisp]]. Like their more dangerous kin, flickerwisps prefer to haunt lonely swamps or stretches of lonely rivers or creeks, particularly near the shorelines where they can pass themselves off as nothing more than a small gathering of fireflies. A flickerwisp's body is a 3-foot-long length of hair-like fibers that flashes and pulses with ribbons and points of eerie yellow light as the creature flits through the air.
 While a flickerwisp can taste fear, and finds the flavor delectable, it does not feed on this emotion. Instead, flickerwisps subsist on confusion and doubt. The sense of unease a traveler exudes when they become lost in the woods is flickerwisps' favorite repast. They can sip from this sense of disorientation without betraying their presence or harming their prey. Eventually, the flickerwisps grow too hungry and are compelled to flit closer, confuse their prey, and glut on the raw emotions. Flickerwisps do their best to swoop away before death occurs, and the most skilled of these tormentors can keep a chosen meal alive for days, sipping from confusion in small doses.

On a critical success, the creature is temporarily immune to Flicker for 24 hours.</span>

###  Empty Caresses

Just as the cult of Nhimbaloth regards [[DATABASE/monster/Will-o’-Wisp|will-o'-wisp]]s as their goddess's eyes, their teachings hold that flickerwisps are the gentle caress of her touch. To them, the confusion imposed by a flickerwisp is akin to opening the mind to the goddess's presence, and many cultists of the faith keep flickerwisps around to use in much the same way other faiths use incense or intoxicants to achieve deeper religious ecstasies.
