# Skulltaker

Swirling down from misty peaks and through howling mountain passes like an evil wind, the vortex of bones known as a skulltaker is a terrible manifestation of the delirium and agony experienced by doomed climbers and lost trailblazers just before they met their end. In some places, a skulltaker is also known as a saxra.

**Skeletal Lore** (divination, divine) A skulltaker taps into the memories of the creatures whose bones make up its body. This gives it the Skeletal Lore skill, which it can use to Recall Knowledge of any kind. In addition, it can speak and understand all the languages known by the creatures whose bones make up its body (typically including Common and the regional language of the skulltaker's home region). The skulltaker can use Skeletal Lore as the primary skill check for the legend lore ritual, and it can cast legend lore without secondary casters.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bonetaker** (divine, necromancy) Whenever a creature dies within 60 feet of a skulltaker, the skulltaker draws a portion of the creature’s bones into its shard storm. The creature must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or rise as a _[[DATABASE/monster/Skeletal Champion|skeletal champion]]_ in 1d4 rounds. These skeletal champions are controlled by the skulltaker.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Energy Drain** (divine, necromancy) When a skulltaker hits with a melee Strike, the target must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or become drained 2 and doomed 1.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Splintered Ground** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The skulltaker causes splintered bones to erupt from all solid surfaces in a 100-foot emanation, except for surfaces of worked stone. A creature moving through the bones takes 10 piercing damage and 10 negative damage for every 5 feet of movement. The first time each round a creature takes piercing damage from these splintered bones, it must succeed at a Reflex save or take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds for 10 minutes, or a –15-foot circumstance penalty for 24 hours on a critical failure. The bones remain in place until the skulltaker uses this action again or the bones are manually removed, which takes 10 minutes for each 5-foot square.</span>

###  Skulltaker Insight

The cooperation of a skulltaker is a powerful asset, for this whirling mass of death knows the collective memories of the creatures whose bones form its body. Because mountain travelers come from far and wide, the breadth of a skulltaker’s knowledge is often vast, spanning a range of topics.
