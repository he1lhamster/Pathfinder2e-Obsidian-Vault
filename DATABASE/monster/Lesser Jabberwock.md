During this time, flight of any kind in the emanation requires a successful DC 41 [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Maneuver in Flight|Maneuver in Flight]], and creatures flying toward the jabberwock are moving through greater difficult terrain. Creatures on the ground in the emanation must succeed at a DC 41 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to approach the jabberwock.</span>
