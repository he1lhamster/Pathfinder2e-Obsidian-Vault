<span class="in-box-ability">**[[Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The faceless butcher can take on the exact form of any Small, Medium, or Large humanoid whose face they carry in their bag of faces, changing their shape and physical features to precisely match that of the victim whose face they wear. This doesn't change the butcher's Speed or attack or damage bonuses with their Strikes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Remove Face** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirements** The faceless butcher is within reach of a [[Dying]], [[Immobilized]], or [[Unconscious]] creature; **Effect** The faceless butcher attempts a cleaver Strike or an [[Athletics]] check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the faceless butcher deals damage as if they had made a successful cleaver Strike against the creature and removes the creature's face. On a critical success, the damage doubles and the creature takes 4d6 [[Persistent Damage]]. Once its face is removed, the creature takes a permanent –4 status penalty to Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. This penalty can be removed only if the victim recovers its face from the faceless butcher and has a [[Restoration]] spell cast on it.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Sudden Slices** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirements** The faceless butcher is [[Undetected]] by their target; **Effect** The faceless butcher Strides once and makes two cleaver Strikes against the target. During the Stride, they gain a +10-foot circumstance bonus to their Speed.</span>
