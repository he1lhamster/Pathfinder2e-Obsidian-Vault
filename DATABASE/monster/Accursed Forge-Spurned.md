<span class="in-box-ability">**Eternal Damnation** (divine, necromancy) As long as its _soul chain_ remains intact, the accursed forge-spurned can't be truly destroyed and rises again fully healed at the next sundown, even if its physical body was destroyed. Information about _soul chains_ appears [[DATABASE/monster/Forge-Spurned|here]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Searing Heat** (fire) A creature that touches the accursed forge-spurned (including [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|grappling]] it or hitting it with an unarmed attack) takes 4d6 fire damage (DC 33 basic Reflex save).</span>

This can affect either a 30-foot cone or a 20-foot burst centered on the accursed forge-spurned and persists for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that move into or start their turn in the area take 12d6 fire damage (DC 36 basic Reflex save). A creature that fails its save is also [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 minute. Creatures within the cloud are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], though not from the accursed forge-spurned. The accursed forge-spurned can't use Forge Breath again until it has used Inflate Bellows.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Inflate Bellows** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirement** The accursed forge-spurned has used Forge Breath. **Effect** The accursed forge-spurned re-inflates its flaccid lungs, enabling it to use Forge Breath again.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Soul Chain** (divine, fire, necromancy) If a creature is slain by an attack from the soul chain and the accursed forge-spurned is able to retain the creature's corpse, it can bind the creature's soul into the _soul chain_ (as [[DATABASE/spell/Bind Soul|bind soul]]) with a day of work at a forge and a DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check. An individual whose soul is bound in this way can't be resurrected unless the _soul chain_ is destroyed (Hardness 10, 40 HP, BT 20).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Soul Siphon** (divine, necromancy) When the accursed forge-spurned critically hits a target with its soul chain, the chain leeches away a portion of the target's soul. The target must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save. 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]]. 
**Failure** The target is drained 2. 
**Critical Failure** The target is drained 2 and [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 2]] from the pain.</span>
