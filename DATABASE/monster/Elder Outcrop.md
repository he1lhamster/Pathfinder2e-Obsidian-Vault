# Elder Outcrop

An outcrop of dense stone that spends ages eroding can gain sapience and slowly awaken with the wisdom of nature. Such elemental beings are slow to action and difficult to anger, spurred only by immediate threats.

A creature grabbed or restrained by a stone hand at the end of its turn becomes [[Slowed]] or increases its existing slowed condition by 1.

###  Wisdom of Stone

Elder outcrops learn a lesson for every grain of rock eroded away, every squall and freeze that has shaped their craggy bodies. As wizened advisors and tutors, they have the respect and affection of other elementals, as well as from natural creatures. [[Druid]] of the [[Stone]] revere the wisdom of elder outcrops, always happy to receive their wide perspective, literal and philosophical.
