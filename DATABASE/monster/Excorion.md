# Excorion

These hideous undead creatures result from an exquisitely painful necromantic process where flayed humanoids are animated through their exposed blood vessels. Cults of undeath typically punish apostates and renegades with this cruel method of reanimation, though sacrificial victims or unfortunate prisoners might suffer a similar fate. Excorions have supernaturally strong, pulsing veins that extend outward from their bodies like thousands of tiny, bloody cilia.
 Excorions move their bulks not with their dead muscles but with heaving contractions of their blood vessels, which pull them along in a swift but jerky manner. Excorions can shift their magical blood easily throughout their bodies, allowing them to squirt blood from their gaping, skinless mouths or to messily mark their foes.
 Most excorions are so broken by the process of their creation that they retain few memories of their past lives or identities. This is, typically, a minor blessing in their cursed tale, protecting the excorion's former friends and family from truly realizing their horrific fate.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Vein Walker** The excorion moves about by way of hundreds of pulsating blood vessels, which stretch from its body in dozens of tight, ropy bundles and anchor it to the ground. An excorion can't be [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Tripped]], [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shoved]], or otherwise forcibly moved except by magic, and the excorion ignores difficult terrain (but not greater difficult terrain).</span>

The excorion makes a fist Strike against an adjacent creature; this doesn't count toward the excorion's multiple attack penalty. On a hit, the attack does no damage, but the creature becomes observed to every excorion within 60 feet, even if an excorion's line of sight would be blocked by a wall or other obstacle. This effect lasts until the handprint is washed off, which requires water and spending 3 actions to fully clean off.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vital Transfusion** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirements** The excorion has at least 70 Hit Points; **Effect** The excorion sacrifices itself and transfers its bloody, vital energy to a willing living creature within 30 feet. The excorion is immediately destroyed, and the targeted living creature heals a number of HP equal to half the excorion's remaining HP at the time that it used this ability. The living creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] during its next turn as its body adjusts to the newly transfused blood and vital energy; the living creature also counts as an excorion for 1 minute for the purpose of seeing other excorions' Bloody Handprint marks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vomit Blood** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The excorion spews necrotic blood all over a foe it has [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]]. The grabbed creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 2]].</span>

###  Excorion Behemoths

Specialized necromantic rituals are required to make larger excorions, as their blood vessels demand exponentially greater strength to move their larger body masses. These excorion behemoths are usually created from [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Giant|giants]], [[DATABASE/monster/Elephant|elephants]], [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dinosaur|dinosaurs]], or even [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Titan|titans]] in rare instances.
