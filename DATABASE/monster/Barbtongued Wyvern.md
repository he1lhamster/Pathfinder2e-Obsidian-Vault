Up to two creatures within 200 feet of the wyvern can be targeted; each creature must attempt a DC 40 Reflex save. The barbtongued wyvern can't use Pin to the Sky again until its next turn.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes 2d12+3 piercing damage.
**Failure** The target takes 5d12 piercing damage and is pinned in place, fastened to the underlying magical nature of Thousandbreaths by the barbs (even if not adjacent to a solid surface). It is [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] until it [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]]. If the creature is under the effects of a spell that would prevent it from being immobilized, Thousandbreaths first attempts a Counteract check against the spell (+27).
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes 10d12 piercing damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] 1 until it escapes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Reel In** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Requirements** The wyvern has a creature grabbed in its tongue. **Effect** The wyvern moves the creature up to 20 feet closer to it.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ripping Grab** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** The wyvern's last action was a success with a barbed tongue Strike, or it has a creature grabbed using this action. **Effect** If the target was immobilized by Pin to the Sky, the wyvern first painfully rips it free of the effect, dealing 4d12 piercing damage. Regardless of whether or not the target was previously immobilized, the wyvern [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grabs]] the target until the end of the monster's next turn. The wyvern can't use its tongue to Strike creatures until the Grab ends. Using Ripping Grab extends the duration of the monster's Grab until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it. A grabbed creature can use the [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] action to get out of the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creature if the barbtongued wyvern moves away from it.</span>
