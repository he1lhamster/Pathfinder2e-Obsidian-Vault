# Sié Goluo

Sié Goluo, sometimes referred to simply as Grandfather, is an ancient spirit that has kept watch over the peoples of the Mwangi Expanse for generations. Most believe he first appeared during the Age of Darkness to protect the Mwangi people from the worst dangers of the everlasting night. Bekyar storytellers claim he is older still, from a time before the first people walked Golarion. This immortal spirit has incarnated into multiple forms over millennia. In the oldest surviving tales, they say Sié Goluo looked like an ordinary—if oversized—ox, save for his nearly human-looking eyes. Most recently, people say he has the appearance of several different animals, but accounts vary on which animals make up his form.
 When a traveling farmer is assailed by a deadly beast, or a small village faces the wrath of an advancing army, Sié Goluo manifests in whatever form will allow him to best defend them. There seem to be no geographical limitations on where he can manifest, as there are tales of him saving Mwangi adventurers as far spread as Tian Xia and Arcadia.

###  An Absent Relative

Because sightings are so rare, not all Mwangi people believe Sié Goluo exists. Many regard him as merely another children's tale spun by their grandparents to soothe them to sleep. After all, there is very little physical evidence of his existence, he can't be reached through divination, and he disappears without a trace when he finishes what he set out to do. Some skeptics, when recounting tales of their death-defying exploits, might end their story with the phrase, “And Grandfather nowhere in sight!”
