# Inmyeonjo

Mountain guides whisper stories of giant white birds that stretch towards the sky, singing with human voices. While these stories are often dismissed as tall tales, the truth is much stranger, for the bird they've encountered not only has a human voice, but one a human face as well. Inmyeonjos are enormous white birds with flowing tails, abnormally long necks, and mask-like human faces. They wear an elongated black headpiece that serves as a vessel for their life energy, enabling their reincarnation through any living creature.
 Inmyeonjos often serve as gatekeepers or guardians of the tombs of great sages and leaders who brought peace to their lands and people. They can also be found atop on high mountains where the border between earth and sky is thinnest. Ultimately, inmyeonjos strive for balance and peace among all mortals. A person who has encountered an inmyeonjo often has trouble remembering if the strange creature was beautiful or terrifying.

###  Material Reincarnation

When an inmyeonjo dies, their body rapidly decomposes to dust, but their black headpiece remains. The headpiece magically fits itself to any size head. A creature that dons the headpiece becomes immune to disease and stops aging, but cannot remove it by nonmagical means (DC 37 check to counteract). Over the course of 100 years, the creature grows feathers and their neck elongates until they eventually become an inmyeonjo.
