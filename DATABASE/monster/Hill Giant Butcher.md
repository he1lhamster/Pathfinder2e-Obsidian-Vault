It makes two Strikes against its menaced prey, one with each of the required weapons. If both hit the same menaced prey, combine their damage for the purpose of its resistances and weaknesses. In addition, if both Strikes hit, the menaced prey is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of the hill giant butcher's next turn. Apply the hill giant butcher's multiple attack penalty normally.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wide Swing** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The hill giant makes a single greatclub Strike and compares the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes within its reach. This counts as two attacks for the hill giant's multiple attack penalty.</span>
