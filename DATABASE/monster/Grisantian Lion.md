# Grisantian Lion

The appearance of the [[Grogrisant]] is a once-in-a-generation event, but the spawn of that legendary creature are well known in the World's Edge Mountains and throughout Taldor. These primal beasts don't travel in a pride as ordinary lions do. Instead, they avoid others of their kind, even to mate, and they seek out ordinary lions once a year or so for this purpose. A grisantian lion who bears cubs nurses and tends their offspring only long enough for their young to become self-sufficient—which takes only a few months, thanks to their kind's incredibly rapid growth and development.
 A full-grown grisantian lion is as big as an elephant and exceedingly aggressive, hunting anything that comes across its path. While ordinary lions rely on stealth and pack tactics to secure a meal, the grisantian lion is too big to hide in tall grass. Instead, it has adapted to the mountains, where it selects a large and hard-to-reach cave as its home before claiming it from whatever creature is so unfortunate as to already inhabit the place. A grisantian lion is a canny hunter, able to track for miles, and remains behind rocky cliffs and outcroppings as it approaches its prey. Once close enough, it pounces, tearing open the prey's armor and shredding the flesh within. If threatened, a grisantian lion seizes its meal in its mouth and leaps off, scaling a nearby cliff face and retreating to its den.
 Although they're wild creatures that can never be tamed, grisantian lions understand Taldane and occasionally agree to help those who defend nature. However, such alliances are temporary and unreliable at best.
