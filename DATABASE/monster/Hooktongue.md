**Slow Metabolism** Hooktongue can go for 10 years without feeding. After this, its hunger makes it [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] but doesn't otherwise impact its lifespan. If Hooktongue is slowed as a result of starvation, it can remove this condition by using Swallow Whole to gulp down a meal.
**Undetectable** (abjuration, primal) Hooktongue automatically tries to counteract any detection, revelation, or scrying divination attempted against it, using its [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] modifier for the counteract check.

While in this form, Hooktongue's swim Speed increases to 600 feet, it automatically succeeds at [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to Swim, and it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks in water. Hooktongue can remain in this form for 8 hours but can't enter salt water when using this ability. Hooktongue can return to its normal form using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.</span>
