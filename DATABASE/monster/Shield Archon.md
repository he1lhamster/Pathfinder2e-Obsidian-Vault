# Shield Archon

Shield archons defend the fortresses of Heaven against fiendish incursions. They wield their spears and shields in massive formations capable of withstanding any onslaught. Beneath their armor, they are sheathed in skin of steel. Given their tremendous strength and imposing stature, shield archons are ideal guardians of the meek and are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane to ward off the attacks of great numbers of evildoers.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Living Shield** A shield archon’s shield is the focal point of its courage and soul. It always has its shield raised without needing to Raise a Shield, and it can use Shield Block as a free action instead of a reaction (Hardness 10, HP 80). A shield archon can trigger its Shield Block free action when an ally within 10 feet is the target of an attack, reducing damage to that ally instead of itself but otherwise following the normal rules of Shield Block.
**Menacing Guardian** (aura, divine, enchantment) 30 feet. Enemies that start their turn in the area or enter it must attempt a DC 27 Will save. On a failure, they take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls, spell rolls, and damage rolls against any other target while in the aura for 24 hours or until they damage the archon, whichever comes first. On a critical failure, they can’t use hostile actions against any other target while in the area for 24 hours or until they damage the archon, whichever comes first. Regardless of the result, a creature is then temporarily immune to further menacing guardian auras for 24 hours.
