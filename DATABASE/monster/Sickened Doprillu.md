<span class="in-box-ability">**Mask of Power** A doprillu's unique wooden mask is the source of its power. A doprillu deprived of its mask loses its regeneration and its immunity to enfeebled and slowed, and it immediately becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]]. The enfeebled value increases by 1 at the start of each of the doprillu's turns, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If the mask is put back on, the doprillu immediately regains its abilities and loses the enfeebled condition. A creature can pull off the mask with a successful DC 34 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Force Open]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Volcanic Veins** (fire) Fiery magma runs through the doprillu's veins.
