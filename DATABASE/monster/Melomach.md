# Melomach

Melomachs are massive, vaguely humanoid elementals composed of metal debris. They take great pride in decorating and augmenting their metallic bodies with haphazardly placed spikes, blades, humanoid or bestial skulls, and other similar adornments, the more ostentatious the better. When two melomachs meet, the resulting contests of physical might and vocal prowess can last for days, often leaving the landscape ravaged for miles in every direction.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature takes half damage. 
**Failure** The creature takes full damage, is [[Stunned]], and is [[Deafened]] for 1 minute. 
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is stunned 3, and is deafened permanently.</span>

###  Music of Mass Destruction

A melomach's appetite for carnage is matched only by its love of loud noises, particularly the boom of explosions and the shriek of tearing metal. In addition to the sound of their own voices, melomachs are partial to the rapid, discordant strumming and powerful howls that typify the musical stylings typical of the [[Plane of Metal]]. Boisterous performances often draw the attention of melomachs.
