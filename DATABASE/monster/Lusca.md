# Lusca

A lusca is a predatory sea monster that resembles a three-headed shark with the body of an octopus. Ferocious electrical storms usually herald a lusca's arrival; such violent bursts of electricity result from the creature's superconductive flesh, which allows the lusca to store energy from lightning strikes that it can then discharge at foes.

###  Blue Holes

Luscas frequently lurk in blue holes— marine sinkholes that descend far below the surrounding sea bottom and connect to flooded subterranean passages or deeper into the Darklands. For all their might, however, luscas don't dominate these lightless realms. Rather, they are but one of many types of crafty and titanic sea monsters, from the more-familiar [[Alghollthu Master (Aboleth)]] and [[Kraken]] to bizarre hybrids of whales, eels, and cuttlefish.
