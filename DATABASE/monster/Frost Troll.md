# Frost Troll

Frost trolls are nightmarish frozen monsters of rime-stained claws and hoarfrost teeth. Possessing wits superior to those of common trolls, frost trolls often hunt in packs of three—one attacking their quarry openly while the remaining two pause to assess weaknesses before moving in for the kill. Frost trolls relish the taste of human flesh and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain in close proximity to their favorite prey. Of slighter frame than common trolls, a typical frost troll stands 11 feet tall when not hunched and weighs 900 pounds. Their sickly, cracked flesh is of an icy, cerulean pallor. Frost trolls often adorn themselves with trophies of bone and hide flayed from their kills.

###  Deathless Frost

Historically isolated in the remote frozen wilderness of the Saga Lands, frost trolls have increasingly been encountered in more temperate climates on Golarion. It's unclear what's driving these ice-hearted trolls southward, but some suspect the machinations of a wrathful demon lord are at play.
