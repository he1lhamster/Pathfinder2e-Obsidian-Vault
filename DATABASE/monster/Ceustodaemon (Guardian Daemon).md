# Ceustodaemon (Guardian Daemon)

Ceustodaemons are formed from the souls of vile mortals, particularly those who took efforts to hasten their own death, their willingness shaping them into daemonic servants. Their otherworldly senses make them useful for protecting vaults and similar locations on the Material Plane. Ceustodaemons are created to serve, but always seek ways to subvert their bindings, so they can rend their mortal summoners’ flesh. The worst type of conjurer calls upon ceustodaemons merely to set them free into the world in hopes of currying favor with the powers of Abaddon.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, evocation, fire) The ceustodaemon breathes flames in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 7d6 fire damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save). The ceustodaemon and each creature that fails the save catch fire, taking 2d6 persistent fire damage. The breath weapon can’t be used again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drawn to Service** When bringing a ceustodaemon to another plane with effects like a _[[DATABASE/ritual/Planar Binding|planar binding]]_ or _[[DATABASE/ritual/Planar Ally|planar ally]]_ ritual, the primary and secondary skill DCs are reduced by 5, and the ceustodaemon demands only half the normal cost for its service.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vicious Wounds** On a successful jaws or claw Strike, the ceustodaemon viciously tears into its victim as similar wounds appear on its own body. The target takes an extra 1d6 amount of damage, and the ceustodaemon takes the same extra damage. If this extra damage to the target is doubled, due to a critical hit, the ceustodaemon takes double damage as well.</span>
