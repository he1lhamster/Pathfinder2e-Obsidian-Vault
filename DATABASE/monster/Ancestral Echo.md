**Riled by Disrespect** An ancestral echo gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throw DCs against any creature that has not performed at least one task to beautify the site to which the echo is bound. This apples to any PC who didn't succeed at one or more skill checks to clean area D2.
**Site Bound** The ancestral echo can't leave the upper crypt.

### Ancestral Echo

Each spirit's appearance and concerns are described below. Each spirit uses the ancestral echo statistics, adding a few attacks and abilities unique to that spirit.

### Alkepsur

Languages Draconic, Dwarven, Gnomish, Hallit, Petran, Sakvroth
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> ghostly clan dagger +8 (agile, finesse, magical), **Damage** 1d6+2 negative
 **Ancient Anecdote** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, enchantment, linguistic, mental, occult) Frequency once per round; Effect Alkepsur banters with a creature within 60 feet while referencing a forgotten anecdote. The creature must attempt either aDC 18 Will saving throw or DC 15 Dwarf Lore check.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected
**Success** Reduce the creature’s resistances by 1 for 1d4 rounds, after which it’s immune to this ability for 1 round.
**Failure** As success, but the resistances are reduced by 3.
**Critical Failure** As success, but the resistances are reduced by 5.

### Ferghaz

**Languages** Empyrean, Common, Dwarven
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> ghostly hammer +8 (agile, finesse, magical), **Damage** 1d4+3 negative

 **Attack of Opportunity** <span class="action-icon">5</span>
