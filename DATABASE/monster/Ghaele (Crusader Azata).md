description: 'Gennayns are minor genies who often serve as emissaries and messengers
  for greater elemental beings. While many find purpose in this humble mission, their
  true calling and interest is in the arts.<br/><br/> They often appear as miniature,
  athletic humanoids with wisps of elemental energy continually dissipating from their
  bodies. These elemental energies often reflect their emotions and attuned element.
  Gennayns are also fond of ostentatious rings, amulets, and armbands.<br/><br/> Gennayns
  eagerly assist powerful beings who reward and treat them well, but they''re just
  as quick to abandon those they consider boring, stingy, or abusive. Beings who destroy

# Ghaele (Crusader Azata)

Ghaeles are fiend-hunting knights of Elysium and champions of the freedom to take up arms against oppressors and other evils. Ghaeles rarely engage directly in mortal wars, but where fiends are involved they make an exception. A ghaele might assume the guise of a mortal to fight fiends alongside others, hoping to bolster morale and teach good tactics against such supernatural foes. Ghaeles serve various deities and empyreal lords of Elysium, though many have an affinity for Cayden Cailean in his capacity as a champion of freedom and defender of the downtrodden. Among azatas, ghaeles are generally the quickest to shift to violence as a method of solving problems, but even then they seek to minimize pain and suffering when they can.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Free Blade** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Trigger** The ghaele ends its turn while unable to act or attempts a greatsword Strike that would take a circumstance or status penalty. **Effect** A ghaele's blade is implacable in the pursuit of freedom, and its energies can overpower any effect that would interfere with its swordplay. The ghaele attempts to counteract each effect that prevents it from making a greatsword Strike, gives it a penalty to its greatsword Strike, or prevents it from acting. The ghaele can use this ability even if it's otherwise unable to act.
**Light Form** A ghaele's body is partially corporeal and partially composed of light, with a color corresponding to the elemental energy currently residing in its blade (see Choose Weakness). It can move through solid objects but can't end its action within a solid object.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Choose Weakness** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divination, divine, evocation, manipulate) A ghaele attempts to Recall Knowledge about a foe it is facing. If successful, it can change the elemental damage dealt by its greatsword and light ray to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic, usually to match the a foe’s weakness. It can also change its energy resistance to any of these energy types (this can be a different type than for its attacks).
