# Mamlambo

Mamlambos are river predators with hypnotic, bioluminescent skin. They appear similar to crocodiles, but the narrow head at the end of their long necks resembles a horse's skull, and their four legs are stubby and inefficient for land movement. Their skin's green glow is only barely visible in daylight or when underwater, though the glow is difficult to resist. As a result, they're frequently trailed by fish, birds, or other river creatures ensnared by the alluring radiance.
 Humanoids are mamlambos' favorite prey, particularly [[Human]], although they strangely prefer to only eat their victims' faces and brains. Mamlambos are dim-witted but sly, and sometimes hide their victims under submerged rocks or logs to make their discovery less likely. A mamlambo might be active in a region for days or even weeks before its presence is discovered.

**Luminous Lure** (aura, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, light, mental, primal) 30 feet. The mamlambo emits dim light from its skin. A creature that enters or begins its turn in the aura must attempt a DC 23 Will save. Humanoids take a –2 penalty to this saving throw. Regardless of the save's result, the creature is temporarily immune for 10 minutes. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature is [[Slowed]] for 1 round. 
**Failure** The creature is [[Fascinated]], and for as long as it is in the aura it must spend at least 1 of its actions on each of its turns to move closer to the mamlambo as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the creature ends its movement or turn adjacent to the mamlambo, it is slowed 1 until it is out of the aura or until the mamlambo makes a Strike against it. The target can attempt a new Will save at the beginning of each of their subsequent turns, and on a success, the effect ends. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature must spend each of its actions moving closer to the mamlambo, and if it ends its movement or turn adjacent to the mamlambo, it is [[Paralyzed]] until it is out of the aura or until the mamlambo makes a Strike against it.

###  An Unusual Phobia

Mamlambos have an unusually strong aversion to river otters, despite being much larger and more dangerous. Since mamlambos rarely remain in an area inhabited by otters for long, river-dwelling people in the Mwangi Expanse often keep trained otters to aid in fishing and to ward off the potential presence of a mamlambo.
