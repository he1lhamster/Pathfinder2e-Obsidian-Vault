# Iruxi Ossature

[[DATABASE/ancestry/Lizardfolk|Iruxis]], also known as lizardfolk, are surrounded by the spirits of their ancestors—literally, as they honor their dead by incorporating their bones into the architecture of iruxi settlements. Decades of veneration by their descendants have caused primal power to accumulate within these remains. In times of crisis, these earth-encrusted bones reanimate as guardians of last resort. Iruxis often refer to these undead—spirits bathed in starlight animating bone and rock, fueled by the beliefs of the living—as “the twilight guardians.”
 Iruxi ossatures usually reanimate spontaneously when a nesting chamber is violated or blood is spilled in an iruxi settlement's main hall. Truly ancient settlements might be blessed with a few ossatures' presence at all times: guarding nurseries, reliquaries, and the sacred observatories where their descendants study the heavens. These particularly hardy ossatures are composed of fossilized bone and possess dinosaur-like shield frills, horns, or spiked tails.

The floor in a 30-foot cone in front of the ossature becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Any square of a wall built by iruxis that's in the cone lashes out, with fossilized claws damaging any enemy within 5 feet of the wall. This deals 6d6 piercing damage with a DC 22 basic Reflex save. A creature attempts the save only once, even if adjacent to more than one affected square of the wall.

###  Ossatures Around the World

[[DATABASE/ancestry/Lizardfolk|Iruxis]] dwell all over Golarion, and their burial customs vary with the terrain and materials at hand. Ossatures composed of petrified wood, bones, and amber guard the rainforest-dwelling iruxis of Garund and Vudra. The red-sandstone ossatures of Casmaron's badlands follow their nomadic descendants' travels, erupting from the earth at sunset.
