# Ice Golem

Ice golems are either carved from massive blocks of ice, or pieced together from individual components that are then fused together through heat and refreezing. In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of a humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity.
 While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates, the magic that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer temperatures. This, combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower end of the scale as far as cost and difficulty to create, gives these constructs unusual features that puts them in great demand. The rich and powerful in hot, arid regions often commission ice golems not only as guardians for their estates and vaults, but for comfort—the presence of an ice golem standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help to keep the chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice golems as servants to keep drinks cold.

###  Ice Golem Components

When destroyed, the magic sustaining an ice golem's form quickly dissipates. Unless it is in a freezing environment, the golem's shattered remains soon melt completely away. Still, the animating magic can linger in shards of ice that resist melting; these may fetch a good price from wealthy folk to preserve foods or chill beverages. Pieces of ice that are captured and magically preserved or allowed to melt in sealed containers can also be sold to scholars who may be able to divine arcane secrets from the once magically animated materials.
