# Evangelist

Evangelists, the velstracs' unofficial ambassadors, roam the farthest reaches of the planes to spread the word of their kind's abhorrent belief in perfection through pain. They are therefore the most frequently encountered velstracs on the Material Plane, leading covens of hedonistic mortal flesh-sculptors or serving as wardens of horrific dungeons. In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for mortal's souls or choice mortal flesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans, although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh 350 pounds or more.

The target must immediately attempt a Will save against Unnerving gaze. In addition, if the creature was already [[Frightened]], on a failed save, the evangelist is [[Concealed]] from the creature for as long as the creature remains frightened. After attempting this save, the creature is then temporarily immune until the start of the evangelist's next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Impaling Chain** When the evangelist critically hits with a chain Strike, the target is impaled and anchored in place, becoming [[Persistent Damage]] by the chain. The creature is unable to recover from [[Persistent Damage]] damage until it gets free (DC 25 [[Escape]]).</span>
