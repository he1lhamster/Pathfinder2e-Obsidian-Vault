# Greater Barghest

Once a barghest has eaten enough to grow into a greater barghest, it typically seeks a method to leave the Material Plane and return to the Abyss, there joining other fiends as yet another of that plane’s horrors. As barghests have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.
 In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for barghest mutations—feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with new mutations of your own design.

<span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The barghest takes on the shape of a goblinoid (a goblin, hobgoblin, or bugbear) or a wolf, or it transforms back into its true form. When the barghest is a goblinoid, it loses its jaws and claw Strikes, it becomes Small if it is a goblin, and its Speed changes to 20 feet. When the barghest is a wolf, its Speed changes to 40 feet and its jaws gain Knockdown. Each individual barghest has only one goblinoid form and one wolf form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Mutations** The process of consuming corpses to evolve into a greater barghest results in odd and unpredictable physiological changes. A greater barghest has one mutation, typically chosen from the following options.

* **Fangs** (poison) The barghest grows elongated fangs that seep poison. Its jaws deal 1d6 additional poison damage and 1d6 persistent poison damage.
* **Toxic Breath** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, evocation, poison) The barghest breathes a cloud of toxic gas that deals 8d6 poison damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone (DC 25 basic Fortitude save). It can’t use Toxic Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
* **Vestigial Arm Strike** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Frequency **once per round; **Trigger **The barghest completes a Strike. **Effect **The barghest makes a claw Strike with a shriveled third arm hanging from its torso. This attack doesn’t count for the barghest’s multiple attack penalty, nor does that penalty apply on the attack.
* **Wings** The barghest has malformed wings extending from its back. It gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.
