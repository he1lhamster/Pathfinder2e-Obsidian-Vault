# Boiling Spring

Often mistaken for [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Air|air elementals]] due to their hazy, almost-imperceptible forms, a boiling spring is a humanoid water elemental made of scalding steam and bubbling water. When summoned to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Universe]], a boiling spring raises the ambient temperature around them, making the surrounding climate humid and muggy. They seem to enjoy the discomfort they cause, though some regard it as merely a fun prank while others truly revel in the misery and look for ways to cause more.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Freeze and Shatter** If the boiling spring is destroyed with cold damage, their body freezes over and explodes, sending out a wave of frigid air and ice shards that deal 4d6 piercing damage plus 4d6 cold damage to creatures in a 20-foot emanation (DC 36 basic Reflex save).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Sweltering Heat** (aura, fire) 25 feet. The boiling spring radiates heat, raising the air temperature around them.
