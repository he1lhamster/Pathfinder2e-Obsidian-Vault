# Wereboar

Wereboars tend to be aggressive and stubborn, and often live with their own kind in small, remote communities. Even when they're inclined to interact with others, wereboars' short tempers and hostile nature lead other creatures to avoid them. Lone wereboars who settle down—often on remote farms—are extremely territorial, though others are content to roam and explore lands far from home. Their other habits also vary widely from individual to individual, right down to diet: some wereboars might feast on human flesh, while others are mostly vegetarian.

In animal shape, their Speed and size change to that of the animal, they gain any special Strike effects of the animal that they didn't already have (such as [[Grab]]), and they lose their weapon Strikes.
