# Mothman

Little is known of the strange creatures known as mothmen, save that when they make themselves known, calamity is sure to follow. The mothman sees themself as an agent of fate—provided such fate is devastating and destructive. Often, those who encounter a mothman never recall the meeting, yet live on to unknowingly pursue and enable the creature's obscure plans.
 The name “mothmen” is, of course, not these creatures' own name for themselves, but an appellation granted by the fearful who glimpse them and tell harrowing tales of their sightings. They each keep their own names, or a collection for use in different situations, yet have no need for a collective word for their kind.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Agent of Fate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (primal) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The mothman casts any spell of 5th level or lower that normally takes 2 or fewer actions to cast, whether they have those spells in their innate spells or not. They can use this ability only if doing so steers the flow of fate in its proper course toward a disaster or otherwise significantly memorable event. What the proper flow of fate entails is determined by the GM, but some examples include casting [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Scene|illusory scene]] to coax someone to a portentous location, casting [[DATABASE/spell/Sending|sending]] to deliver an important message to someone the exact moment they need to hear it, or casting [[DATABASE/spell/Rusting Grasp|rusting grasp]] to weaken a structure and cause some necessary calamity.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Focus Gaze** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, occult, visual) The mothman fixes their glare at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a Will save against the mothman's portentous gaze. If the creature is already [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] when it attempts this save, on a failure it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 24 hours in addition to the frightened effect. After attempting its save, the creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</span>

###  The Red Bishop

Primary among mothmen on Golarion is the Red Bishop, a priest of [[DATABASE/deity/Pazuzu|Pazuzu]] whose mysterious plans for the small town of Sandpoint in Varisia hinge on the collection and manipulation of adventuring groups. The Red Bishop seeks to cultivate a group that will someday, albeit unknowingly, serve as a final catalyst to unleash a devastating, hidden plot upon the region.
