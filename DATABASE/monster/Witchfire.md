# Witchfire

Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green flames, this incorporeal undead forms when a powerful [[Hag]] or [[Witch]] dies in agony or rage. The body at the center of the flames usually resembles the witch's idealized self-image, regardless of their age and appearance at the time of their death.
 A witchfire often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays around them. These regions are often plagued by [[Will-o’-Wisp]], which seem to have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchfire. A witchfire might visit villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams. A witchfire might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens, but a witchfire is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.
**Recall Knowledge - Spirit ([[Occultism]])**: DC 28
**Recall Knowledge - Undead ([[Religion]])**: DC 28
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 26

A coven can contain one or more witchfires, but it must also include at least one living creature capable of forming a coven; three witchfires cannot form a coven.

###  Wisps and Fire

Witchfires have the ability to summon [[Will-o’-Wisp]], but a number of these aberrations usually linger nearby of their own accord. The fear-inducing witchflame aura manifested by witchfires provides will-o'-wisps their favored sustenance.
