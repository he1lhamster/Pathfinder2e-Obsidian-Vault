# Deimavigga (Apostate Devil)

As masters of cold, calculated logic and perfectly timed proselytization, the loathsome deimaviggas seek to set friend against friend and turn the faithful from their beliefs at every opportunity.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Boundless Reach** (conjuration, divine, teleportation) A deimavigga's razor-sharp claws can slice through reality, allowing them to make claw Strikes and use spells with a range of touch against any creature they can see directly or via divination magic. A creature targeted this way can retaliate until the start of the deimavigga's next turn; it can target the devil's claws as if the devil were physically present and adjacent to the target, though the claws are concealed.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The deimavigga can take on the appearance of any humanoid.

The target must attempt a DC 43 Will save. Celestials and fiends gain a +2 status bonus to this save. 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and temporarily immune to Whisper Earworm for 24 hours. 
**Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Failure** The next time the target rests, it ruminates on the deimavigga's words instead of sleeping or otherwise resting and awakens [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]]. The target also becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] until it's no longer fatigued. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but drained 2. After this rest, the target must attempt another DC 43 Will save. On a failure, the target becomes stupefied 2 and takes a –4 status penalty to Will saves against effects from evil creatures. These effects last until the target unlearns the truth spoken by the deimavigga, requiring a [[DATABASE/spell/Modify Memory|modify memory]] spell, other means of modifying their memory, or powerful magic such as [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]].</span>

###  Lone Operators

While most devils perform a specialized role within a complex infernal machine, deimaviggas work almost exclusively alone, as they find even the most obedient minions a hindrance to their stratagems.
