# Skrik Nettle

The expansive skies of the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]] are home to skrik nettles—delicate, bizarre-looking creatures that resemble large jellyfishes. A fringe of brightly colored feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center, each ending in a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above the First World in flocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the fey realm's cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to float helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below.
 Skrik nettles that find their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than the First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies that they find comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent. The first few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend to be filled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken notion that these others are somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik nettles who find themselves marooned beyond the First World for years never lose their longing for home, and they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for the rest of their lives.

 A levitating creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. It can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If it's adjacent to a fixed object or stable terrain, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). A flying creature can move normally but still increases its altitude as appropriate from the venom. A creature that can't fly falls as soon as it recovers from skrik nettle venom.</span>

###  Skrik Nettle Harvesting

Skrik nettle venom is magical in nature and deteriorates swiftly. A character with alchemist's tools can harvest a single dose of skrik nettle venom from a skrik nettle that has been dead no longer than an hour with a successful DC 24 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check, which transforms the fluid into a standard [[DATABASE/equipment/Potion of Flying|potion of flying]].
