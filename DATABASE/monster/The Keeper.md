<span class="in-box-ability">**Aura of Disquietude** (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 30 feet, DC 41. As [[Frightful Presence]], plus a creature [[Frightened]] by the aura becomes suspicious: it doesn't count any other creature as its ally and can't [[Aid]] or flank. On a critical failure, the creature also can't be a willing target for harmless or helpful magic.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Attack of Opportunity]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** </span><span class="in-box-ability">**Maintain Fate <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (abjuration, occult) **Trigger** The Keeper would be subjected to a misfortune effect, become [[Slowed]], or become [[Stunned]]; **Effect** The Keeper manipulates reality to maintain control of her own destiny and twists the fate of those that dared tamper with her own. The Keeper disrupts the triggering effect and becomes [[Quickened]] until the end of her next turn. She can use the extra action to [[Fly]], Step, Stride, or Strike. If the effect originated from a creature, such as an enemy casting [[Slow]] on the Keeper, that creature is targeted with an [[Ill Omen]] spell. The creature must attempt a DC 44 Will save to determine the effects of the spell.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bloodbird** (curse, occult) A creature hit by a vilderavn's melee attack becomes cursed. It takes 2d6 [[Persistent Damage]] that's difficult to stanch. The DC to stop the bleeding using [[Administer First Aid]] is 41, and healing the creature to full HP doesn't automatically end the bleeding. Removing the curse ends the bleeding.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Change Shape** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The vilderavn takes on the appearance of a Small or Medium humanoid, [[Wolf]], [[Dire Wolf]], or hybrid with both raven and wolf parts. The vilderavn can only use their jaws attack when in a form with a wolf's head, and their talon attack in a form with raven qualities. They can instead assume their raven knight form: a Medium humanoid in black [[Full Plate]] carrying a [[Greatsword]]. They can use their jaws or talon Strikes only in a form that has that body part, and their greatsword only in knight form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Souleater** (necromancy, occult) If the vilderavn kills a humanoid target with a critical hit using their jaws Strike, they rip out and devour the target's heart and soul as part of the attack. While the target is dead, the vilderavn can Change Shape into the target's form, gaining a +4 status bonus to [[Deception]] checks to [[Impersonate]] the target. If magic would resurrect the creature, the caster must succeed at a DC 44 counteract check to extract the target's soul from the vilderavn; otherwise, the spell fails.</span>
