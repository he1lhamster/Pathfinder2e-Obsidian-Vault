As [[DATABASE/monsterability/Frightful Presence|frightful presence]], plus a creature [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] by the aura becomes suspicious: it doesn't count any other creature as its ally and can't [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] or flank.

The Keeper disrupts the triggering effect and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] until the end of her next turn. She can use the extra action to [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]], Step, Stride, or Strike.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bloodbird** (curse, occult) A creature hit by a vilderavn's melee attack becomes cursed. It takes 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] that's difficult to stanch. The DC to stop the bleeding using [[DATABASE/action/Administer First Aid|Administer First Aid]] is 41, and healing the creature to full HP doesn't automatically end the bleeding. Removing the curse ends the bleeding.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Change Shape** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The vilderavn takes on the appearance of a Small or Medium humanoid, [[DATABASE/monster/Wolf|wolf]], [[DATABASE/monster/Dire Wolf|dire wolf]], or hybrid with both raven and wolf parts. The vilderavn can only use their jaws attack when in a form with a wolf's head, and their talon attack in a form with raven qualities. They can instead assume their raven knight form: a Medium humanoid in black [[DATABASE/armor/Full Plate|full plate]] carrying a [[DATABASE/weapon/Greatsword|greatsword]]. They can use their jaws or talon Strikes only in a form that has that body part, and their greatsword only in knight form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Souleater** (necromancy, occult) If the vilderavn kills a humanoid target with a critical hit using their jaws Strike, they rip out and devour the target's heart and soul as part of the attack. While the target is dead, the vilderavn can Change Shape into the target's form, gaining a +4 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|impersonate]] the target. If magic would resurrect the creature, the caster must succeed at a DC 44 counteract check to extract the target's soul from the vilderavn; otherwise, the spell fails.</span>
