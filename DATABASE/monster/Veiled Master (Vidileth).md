# Veiled Master (Vidileth)

The powerful vidileths are the insidious veiled masters of the alghollthus. These manipulators of mind and body alike lead their species in the open, using their ability to change form to walk among and deceive humans and other sapient species. Many veiled masters are even more powerful than the typical specimen presented here and can use a wide range of arcane or occult spells and rituals. While veiled masters command significant combat prowess and impressive magical skills, the greatest danger they pose to others is their uncanny ability to infiltrate into societies much different than their own. The most paranoid of adventurers and conspiracy scholars worry that every major city has been infested by secret cabals of vidileths, while others dismiss this as hogwash and fearmongering. The truth is likely somewhere in between, but it doesn’t take many veiled masters pulling the strings behind the scenes to wreak havoc upon an entire nation!

<span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">4</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) Once per round, a veiled master can take on the appearance of a humanoid of Large, Medium, or Small size or resume its true form. While in humanoid form, the veiled master’s Speed is 30 feet, and it loses its mucus cloud aura and swim Speed. If the humanoid form assumed lacks the aquatic trait, the veiled master loses its own aquatic trait as well. In humanoid form, the veiled master can use weapons, or it can make Strikes that work like its tentacle attack but use the reach of its current form. If the assumed form has fangs or claws, the veiled master can also make such Strikes, but these attacks lack the veiled master’s slime.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Consume Memories** (mental, occult) When a veiled master makes a fangs Strike against a creature, it can consume some of that creature’s memories. The target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude saving throw or become stupefied 1. A veiled master regains 5 Hit Points each time it successfully consumes memories. When a veiled master consumes memories, it learns some of the creature’s memories (subject to the GM’s discretion).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Delayed Suggestion** (enchantment, occult) When a veiled master successfully casts [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] on a creature, a [[DATABASE/spell/Suggestion|suggestion]] spell triggers when the [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] spell ends. This [[DATABASE/spell/Suggestion|suggestion]] usually causes the target to return to the veiled master, so the creature can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] again, but a veiled master can set the [[DATABASE/spell/Suggestion|suggestion]] to different orders if it wishes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Slime** (curse, occult, virulent) **Saving Throw** Fortitude DC 36; **Stage 1** no ill effect (1 round); **Stage 2** the victim’s skin softens, inflicting drained 1 (1 round); **Stage 3** the victim’s skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane, inflicting drained 2 until the curse ends; every hour this membrane remains dry, the creature’s drained condition increases by 1 (permanent). A [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Disease|remove disease]] spell can counteract this curse, but immunity to disease offers no protection against it.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tentacle Flurry** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The veiled master thrashes about with its tentacles. Make a tentacle Strike against each creature within its reach. Roll only one attack roll, and roll the damage only once for all targets.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Thoughtlance** (curse, enchantment, occult) A creature touched by the veiled master’s tentacles, whether those tentacles deal damage or not, must attempt a DC 34 Will save, becoming slowed 1 on a failure or slowed 2 on a critical failure. Each time the affected creature ends its turn, its slowed value decreases by 1.</span>

###  Ancient Influences

The veiled masters influenced the ancient Azlanti, and it was they who invoked the apocalypse of Earthfall to destroy Azlant when humanity grew too prideful. That this act also called down the magical _Starstone_, an artifact capable of transforming mortals into gods, was an ironic turn of events considering the alghollthus’ intolerance for faith.
