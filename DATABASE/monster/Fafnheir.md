<span class="in-box-ability">**Curse of the Woeful Wyrd** (curse, primal) When a creature slays Fafnheir, it becomes home to his soul, which slowly emerges from his killer's body. The creature must attempt a DC 52 Will save or become [[Doomed]] (doomed 1 on a success, unaffected on a critical success). Unless the creature critically succeeded at the saving throw, each day the doomed value increases by 1. If the creature dies while suffering the curse of the woeful wyrd, its corpse explodes in a 60-foot burst with the effect of Blasting Breath. Fafnheir is immediately returned to life in the nearest available space to the corpse with full Hit Points and no conditions. Even an indirect slaying usually still allows Fafnheir to curse the soul of his slayer through the metaphysical link between them.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Enormous** Fafnheir takes up a space of 6 squares by 6 squares (30 feet by 30 feet) and is 60 feet long.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Extra Reactions** Fafnheir gains 2 reactions at the start of each of his turns.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Frightful Presence]]** (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 90 feet, DC 45</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Attack of Opportunity]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** Tail only.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spit Boiling Blood <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** A creature within 60 feet damages Fafnheir; **Effect** Fafnheir spits blood at the creature.

Creatures in the area must also attempt a DC 48 Fortitude save to resist the powerful winds and deafening thunderclaps of the breath.
