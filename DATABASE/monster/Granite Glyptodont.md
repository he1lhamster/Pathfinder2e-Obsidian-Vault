# Granite Glyptodont

This squat and stony creature looks like an armadillo with a large raised back and a flail-like tail. The granite glyptodont has no true need to feed, as with all elementals, yet it does seem to linger after transforming the flesh of those it calcifies, as if the mere proximity of flesh fossilizing into stone pleases it somehow.

The target must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude saving throw or become [[Slowed]] (or slowed 2 on a critical failure). Further failed saves against calcification increase the value of the slowed condition. Once a creature's actions are reduced to 0 by calcification, that creature becomes [[Petrified]]. If the creature isn't petrified, the slowed conditions end once 1 minute passes without the creature failing a save against calcification. 
Every 24 hours after it was petrified, the creature can attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save to recover. On a success, it becomes flesh again, but is slowed 1 for the next 24 hours. On a critical success, the creature recovers and isn't slowed. On a failure, the creature remains petrified, but can try again in 24 hours. On a critical failure, the petrification is permanent, and the creature can't attempt any more saves.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Earth Glide** A granite glyptodont can [[Burrow]] through earthen matter, including rock.
