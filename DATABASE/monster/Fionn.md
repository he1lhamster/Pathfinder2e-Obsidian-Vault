**Bound to the Mortal Night** Unlike most ghosts, Fionn isn't bound to a specific site. Instead, his exile to the Material Plane has bound him to the night itself. He can travel anywhere he wishes, so long as it is night. During the day, he cannot travel further than thirty feet from the location he occupies as the sun rises. He cannot leave the Material Plane at all, and if he suffers an effect that would normally transport him to another plane, he remains on the Material Plane and instead is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned]] 3.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Command the Undead** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (necromancy) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** Fionn's orders are difficult for undead to ignore. When Fionn Commands the Undead, two undead allies who are lower level than him and are within 30 feet of him may Stride or Strike.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Exile's Curse** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (attack, curse, enchantment, mental, misfortune, primal) Fionn casts outcast's curse, extending the spell's range to 30 feet. A creature that fails its save against the spell is also [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] 1 (stupefied 2 on a critical failure) by the overwhelming sensation and belief that they have been exiled from all they hold dear. This stupefaction value cannot be reduced below 1 as long as the creature continues to be affected by [[DATABASE/spell/Outcast's Curse|outcast's curse]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Fearsome Blizzard** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (aura, cold, evocation, primal) Fionn exhales a swirling blizzard of snow and ice that chills the soul as surely as it freezes flesh. All living creatures within 60 feet of Fionn must attempt a DC 33 Fortitude save. Fionn can't use Fearsome Blizzard for 1d4 rounds.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature takes 5d8 cold damage.
 **Failure** The creature takes 10d8 cold damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] 1; the frightened effect has the emotion, fear, and mental traits.
 **Critical Failure** The creature takes 20d8 cold damage, is frightened 2, and is fleeing as long as they remain frightened. The frightened and fleeing effects have the emotion, fear, and mental traits.</span>
