# Sand Sentry

Shifting back and forth between a detailed likeness of a human and a muted and featureless bipedal form, this creature of pure sand moves with an eerie grace. The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over an area of great importance—these elementals are patient participants in such roles, making them well suited for long-term service.

###  Sand Mimics

Sand sentries have no true culture or society of their own, but they are endlessly fascinated with the society and culture of humanoids they encounter. They can shape their appearance to mimic any similarly sized humanoids, and although they always remain obviously composed of sand, they do their best to mimic the day-to-day activities they observe other humanoids performing. Of course, structures and objects sand sentries build from sand never last, but this never seems to stifle their obsession.
