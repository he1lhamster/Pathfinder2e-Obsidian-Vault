# Sinspawn

Sinspawn were created by one of seven ancient wizards known collectively as runelords—each of whom embraced and embodied one of seven sins. The first sinspawn was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn’t long before the technique used to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn’s bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn’s veins appear to run with gold while envyspawn appear even more wasted than the rest of their kin.

## Sinspawn Sins

When a sinspawn is created, it becomes associated with one of the seven sins: envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, or wrath. A sinspawn’s sin is determined by the _runewell_ that spawned it or by its creator’s preferred sin, and cannot be changed. Each sin grants sinspawn associated with it additional benefits and abilities beyond those described by the sinspawn stat block, as detailed below.

### Envyspawn

An envyspawn has Deception +7 and typically carries a halberd. They tend to be shorter and thinner than other sinspawn.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> halberd +10 (reach 10 feet, versatile S), **Damage** 1d10+4 piercing
 **Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against an envyspawn’s sinful bite are enfeebled 2 for 1 minute.

### Gluttonyspawn

A gluttonyspawn has Survival +10 and usually carries a scythe. They are obese, but hardy and strong.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> scythe +10 (deadly d10, trip), **Damage** 1d10+4 slashing
 **Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a gluttonyspawn’s sinful bite are drained 1.

### Greedspawn

A greedspawn has Thievery +9 and typically wields a glaive. They are the tallest of sinspawn, often 7 feet in height, and with gold-tinged veins.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> glaive +10 (deadly d8, forceful, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 1d8+4 slashing
 **Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a greedspawn’s sinful bite are clumsy 2 for 1 minute.

### Lustspawn

A lustspawn has Diplomacy +7 and usually carries a guisarme. They have attractive bodies, but hideous faces.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> guisarme +10 (reach 10 feet, trip), **Damage** 1d10+4 slashing
 **Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a lustspawn’s sinful bite are stupefied 2 for 1 minute.

### Pridespawn

A pridespawn has Intimidation +7 and often wields a maul. They are nearly skeletal in their gauntness, and often seek out fine clothes or jewelry to wear, taking strange pleasure in appearing elegant and regal.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> maul +10 (shove), **Damage** 1d12+4 bludgeoning
 **Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a pridespawn’s sinful bite are clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.

### Slothspawn

A slothspawn has Society +6 and usually carries a longspear. Thick rolls of excess skin drape the slothspawn’s hunched frame.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> longspear +10 (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 1d8+4 piercing
 **Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a slothspawn’s sinful bite take a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute.

### Wrathspawn

The most commonly encountered of the sinspawn, a wrathspawn has Athletics +12 and typically wields a ranseur. These sinspawn are the bulkiest looking of their kind.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> ranseur + 10 (disarm, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 1d10+4 piercing
 **Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a wrathspawn’s sinful bite are drained 1 as well as enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.

###  Born of Sin

Unable to procreate themselves, sinspawn retreated from the world for many centuries following the collapse of the runelords’ empire, but in recent years they have emerged from ancient dungeons, strange magical pools, and other forgotten ruins. In certain cases, incredibly powerful artifacts crafted by the runelords known as runewells can siphon off fragments of sinful memories and emotions related to the runewells’ associated sins from the souls of people dying nearby, fueling the spontaneous creation of new sinspawn. When enough sinful energies have been gathered within a runewell, it vomits forth a fully grown sinspawn with no prior loyalty to a long-lost runelord. All sinspawn inherently understand the runewells’ role in the propagation of their kind, and they often establish small villages near awakened runewells, hunting down sentient beings they can use to propagate their communities.

###  Sinspawn Locations

Sinspawn are found in regions where sources for their creation remain buried in ancient ruins—in Golarion, this currently limits them to the frontier lands of Varisia. But as they spread, so to does the potential knowledge of crafting more of them, and fleshwarpers around the world are hoping to someday soon craft new sinspawn of their own.
