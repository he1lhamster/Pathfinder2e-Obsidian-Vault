# Najra Lizard

Among the smallest breeds of dragon on Golarion, these savage, cunning hunters dwell near the oases that dot the inhospitable Narhari Desert in Vudra. Land-bound, they scamper across the badlands on four short limbs, their speckled brown and yellow bodies blending into the terrain.
 Though najra lizards live and sleep alone or in mated pairs near their hunting grounds, groups of up to two dozen work in unison to hunt. The lowest-ranked members of a najra lizard swarm leave their hidden dens to target prey with their parching spit. Once the unquenchable thirst caused by their venom drives the creature to the nearby watering hole, the entire swarm attacks. Even when unable to overwhelm foes with sheer numbers, najra lizards have little interest in fighting fairly. They often use their tails to rustle nearby desert scrub, hurl small stones, or otherwise divert attention so they can sneak away or attack from hiding.
 Najra lizards dislike humanoids and humanoid civilization, and they are particularly rankled by being called mere “lizards.” They refer to themselves by a [[DATABASE/language/Draconic|Draconic]] word that translates roughly to “swarm dragon.” Like almost all dragons, najra lizards covet shiny metals and glittering gems. They typically hide accumulated treasures in small holes near where they sleep, and arguments over such caches are one of the few things that engender violence among members of the same pack.

###  Najra Lizard Venom

Though difficult to obtain, najra lizard venom has several uses across Vudran society. Apothecaries find it can be an effective part of medical treatments, while certain sects of monks believe its parching effects help them achieve spiritual revelations. The wealthy may seek to dose a rival with diluted najra lizard venom at important functions, hoping their thirst will make them drink too much alcohol and create an embarrassing spectacle.
