# Adamantine Golem

Crafted from a nigh-indestructible metal of great rarity, adamantine golems can’t be destroyed except by the most powerful foes. Crafting an adamantine golem requires a quantity of adamantine so massive that collecting it usually requires mounting a mining expedition to a distant planet, the Plane of Earth, or an Outer Plane.

Instead, it enters repair mode, during which it is slowed 1, can’t take reactions, and can take only the Self-Repair action. Once it has more than 30 HP, it can use any type of action and can use reactions, though it remains slowed 1 and can’t take any reactions until the start of its next turn. If a critical hit with an adamantine vorpal weapon reduces the golem to 0 HP, or if such a weapon hits it while it’s already at 0 HP, then the golem is destroyed.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Vulnerable to Dispelling** The golem can be targeted by [[DATABASE/spell/Disjunction|disjunction]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]. If targeted by such a spell of 9th level or higher, the golem has its resistance to physical damage lowered to 15 and is slowed 1 (or slowed 2 if in repair mode) for 1d4 rounds. During this time, if the golem is reduced to 0 HP while already in repair mode, it is destroyed.</span>

###  Adamantine Golems

The incredible amount of adamantine necessary to create a single adamantine golem is worth more than many nations’ treasuries. The powerful heart of an adamantine golem can be turned into a legendary forge for blacksmithing.
