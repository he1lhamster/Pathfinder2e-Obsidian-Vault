# Feral Skull Swarm

Some skull swarms are crafted from the heads of feral and dangerous beasts. These can include predatory cats, bears, dinosaurs, and the like, but just as often they're made from bulls, horses, apes, and other creatures that were gentler in life. In death, a feral skull swarm is bloodthirsty regardless of its origins, with a keen scent for living flesh. Even herbivore skulls diligently chew on the flesh of their swarm's victims.
