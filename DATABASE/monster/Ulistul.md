# Ulistul

Having replaced over half her body with scavenged and rebuilt parts, Ulistul is a patchwork juggernaut and stubborn survivor. Her pieces are in various colors, making it obvious even from a distance that not all her parts come from the same source.
 Her golemcraft in mortal life and millennia of practice since grant her intuitive understanding of constructs, including ways to subvert or sabotage those machines' programming. When she does fight, it's most often to abduct a scholar or artificer whose talents she craves. In preparation for battle, she replaces her left hand with a long claw that resembles a hooked sword.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Artificer's Command** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** Ulistul directs one construct within 60 feet that can perceive her and has a level lower than hers, delivering helpful commands that improve its capabilities. The construct gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Artificer's Eye** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (arcane, divination, scrying) Ulistul chooses one construct or statue she can currently perceive with a precise sense or with statuesense; usually, her only precise sense is vision. After choosing her target, she begins to perceive the target's surroundings as though she occupied its space. If the target is either an inanimate statue or a mindless creature, she can also verbally interact with nearby creatures (including issuing Artificer's Commands) or cause the target to move subtly, such as moving its mouth. This ability can be sustained indefinitely as long as Ulistul can perceive the target, though her visual stimuli from her own body are harder to process; she's [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] when using her own senses for the effect's duration.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Dismantler** Ulistul's attacks against constructs and objects gain the deadly d12 trait and ignore up to 10 of the target's Hardness and resistances.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ivory Dictum** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (arcane, enchantment, incapacitation) Ulistul takes control of a construct within 30 feet.
