# Stone Lion

Stone lions are a common sight outside of banks, temples, palaces, and even private residences. The fierce expressions affixed on their faces remind passersby to stay on their best behavior. 
Stone lions remain faithful guardians of a site, regardless of whether it falls into disrepair. Even if people abandon a place, the lion remains dutiful until its statue is too worn or broken to inhabit any longer.

**Anchored Soul** The stone lion is mystically bonded to its bonded vessel and must remain within 1 mile of it. Some might be further restricted to the location it guards.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bonded Vessel** The condition of a stone lion's vessel dictates the lion's maximum Hit Point value. Undamaged, the vessel is an object with 50 Hit Points (BT 25). When the stone lion is in spirit form, damaging it doesn't hurt the vessel, but damaging the vessel deals an equal amount of damage to the stone lion. When the stone lion Inhabits its Vessel, they're a single target, and damage reduces the Hit Points of both the stone lion and the vessel. If the vessel is [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], the stone lion can still fight normally while inhabiting it and suffers no ill effect, but if the vessel is ever destroyed, the stone lion is instantly slain and can't reconstitute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Reconstitution** (divine, necromancy) When the stone lion reaches 0 Hit Points, its spirit dissipates. If its bonded vessel is intact, the stone lion re-forms in this vessel after 2d4 days, fully healed. If the vessel is [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], it must first be [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repaired]], after which the stone lion reforms in 3d4 days.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Ferocious Roar** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (auditory, emotion, fear, mental, sonic) The lion makes a terrifying roar that deals 2d8 sonic damage (DC 23 basic Fortitude save) to each creature in a 20-foot cone.

It can cease Inhabiting its Vessel by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait. While Inhabiting the Vessel, it loses its fly Speed and gains **Immunities** healing, nonlethal;**Resistances** physical 5 (except bludgeoning); **Speed** 30 feet; and the following Strikes.

</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spirit Body** When not Inhabiting its Vessel, the stone lion is incorporeal and gains resistance 5 to all damage (except force damage and damage from Strikes with the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] property rune; double resistance against non-magical).</span>

###  Bleeding Omen

Legends say that stone lions can predict incoming storms or floods. If a stone lion's eyes, nose, or ears bleed, preparations should be made. Lone survivors of these disasters claim those who disparage such omens as superstition often don't live to see the next dawn.
