# Rust Scarab

These elementals resemble enormous beetles, with thick outer shells composed of multiple layers of heavily pockmarked, rusted plates protecting a jagged metallic skeleton.
**Recall Knowledge - Elemental ([[Arcana]], [[Nature]])**: DC 20

**Str** +6, **Dex** +2, **Con** +5, **Int** +2, **Wis** +2, **Cha** +2
**Heavy** As long as it is immobile, the elemental can't be forcibly moved or knocked prone. If it takes a move action, it loses this immunity until the start of its next turn.
**Rust Vision** A rust scarab ignores the [[Concealed]] condition from rust clouds.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Crumbling Carapace** When a rust scarab is reduced to fewer than half its maximum Hit Points or is damaged by a critical hit, its outer shell breaks into a veil of rusty metal flakes. This causes it to lose its resistance to physical damage and its heavy ability, but it gains a rust cloud aura (as [[Metal Wisp]]) and a 35-foot land Speed.</span>

###  Ancient Remnants

No rust scarab specimens free of deterioration have been documented, leading to debate among scholars as to whether this state of corrosion is their natural condition, or whether the creatures are spectacularly ancient even by the standards of immortal elemental beings.
