# Xotani, The Firebleeder

A monstrosity of living flame and magma, Xotani may be the weakest of Rovagug’s spawn, but it remains a formidable threat. Xotani was slain in 2104 AR by an alliance of spellcasters, but recently its deathlike slumber was interrupted. Its corpse twitches, signaling that it might be close to returning.
