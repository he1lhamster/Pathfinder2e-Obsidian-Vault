# Annis Hag

Annis hags are brutal torturers and murderers, delighting in the musical screams and tasty flesh of young creatures and those who are pure of heart. Annis hags are the most direct of all hags, engaging in physical combat and using their change shape ability to hunt rather than to infiltrate and betray humanoids. But an Annis hag takes a grisly trophy from each kill and uses it to sow discord, sending the trophy to one of her victim’s loved ones in a way that implicates another family member in the murder. Also known as iron hags, annis hags have iron-like yet flexible flesh that resists edged weapons, and their own touch is the same cold iron that burns the flesh of other hags. This allows them to bully their way to the leadership of hag covens.

Unlike a normal Grapple, the annis hag doesn’t need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature escapes (DC 24), causing the cage to crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by attacking it.
