<span class="in-box-ability">**Necrotic Decay** (divine, necromancy, negative) When an urdefhan dies, its invisible flesh quickly rots away and sublimates into a foul-smelling gas that fills a 5-foot emanation around the body. This gas deals 12d6 negative damage to creatures in this area as their flesh curdles and rots as well (DC 32 basic Fortitude save).</span>

The urdefhan chooses one of two options, each of which requires a DC 32 Fortitude save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.

* **Drain Blood** The urdefhan drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is [[Drained]] and the urdefhan regains 5 HP (or, on a critical failure, it's drained 2 and the urdefhan regains 10 HP).
* **Drain Vitality** (necromancy) The urdefhan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Enfeebled]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or enfeebled 2 for 1 hour on a critical failure).
