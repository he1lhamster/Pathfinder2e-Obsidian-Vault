# Yellow Musk Brute

A creature transformed by a yellow musk creeper's tendrils boring into its brain becomes a yellow musk thrall if it's Small or Medium, or a yellow musk brute if Large (a Small creature becomes a Small thrall rather than a Medium one). The transformation takes 1 hour. A yellow musk thrall takes only the most rudimentary of actions: bringing the yellow musk creeper water and new creatures to infest. After a few days (or if the creeper dies), the thrall wanders off into the wilderness and falls dead within 24 hours. The body of a deceased thrall sprouts a new yellow musk creeper within hours of its death, becoming a fully grown plant within 24 hours.

###  Recovery from Thralldom

A creature that's transformed into a yellow musk thrall or brute doesn't die right away, although it no longer retains its personality, memories, or abilities as long as it exists as a thrall. Within the first few days after its transformation, a thrall or brute can be restored to its normal life with any magical effect that can remove disease or a 1-hour procedure that requires a successful DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] (expert) check and deals 2d6 slashing damage to the thrall or brute.
