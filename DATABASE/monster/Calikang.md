# Calikang

Calikangs are giant, blue-skinned, six-armed guardians of ancient tombs and treasuries. They each feel a deep, inherent drive to protect and guard, making them highly sought after as wardens and bodyguards. Because most serve as solitary guardians, few calikang societies exist.
 Calikangs' unique physiologies enable them to absorb and manipulate electrical magic as well as other energies. They can live for 200 years—though they can further extend their lives via suspended animation. For this reason, many are chosen to guard tombs or other sealed sites where living guardians would perish and constructs would deteriorate.

**Suspended Animation** (concentrate) By concentrating for 5 minutes, the calikang can enter a state of suspended animation, freezing in place and becoming motionless but remaining aware of their surroundings. While in this state, the calikang gains a +4 status bonus to Fortitude saves; doesn't age; and is immune to disease, inhaled toxins, poison, starvation, and thirst. The calikang can exit suspended animation as a free action. If they exit this state to attack, the calikang gains a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative roll.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Energy Conversion** (abjuration, arcane) Whenever the calikang is hit by an electricity spell's attack roll or rolls a successful save against a spell that deals electricity damage, they absorb the energy. This heals the calikang for an amount of HP equal to quadruple the spell's level and recharges their Breath Weapon. A calikang can't absorb their own spells this way.</span>

Each Strike must be against a different target. These attacks count toward the calikang's multiple attack penalty, which doesn't increase until after all the attacks are complete. For 1 round, the calikang gains a circumstance bonus to their AC equal to the number of Strikes they choose not to take, to a maximum of +4 for taking only two Strikes.</span>

###  Calikang Origins

Legend holds that an ancient Vudrani god failed to protect an important treasury from a raid by [[Asura]]. In shame, he severed his fingers and cast them down upon the world. Calikangs arose from the fingers, and, as penance, they've sought to protect worldly holdings from robberies or invasions ever since
