# Vampire Squid

Vampire squid are neither undead nor blood drinkers. Their name is instead inspired by their red eyes and the dark, cloak-like webbing between their arms. Living in the lightless depths of the ocean, the vampire squid can eject a cloud of bioluminescent mucus that nauseates predators.
