# Obsidian Golem

The art of golem animation is not limited to societies with access to expensive crafting materials or a long history of arcane mastery. Among the resource-poor [[Xulgath]] who dwell in the Darklands, especially those hardy clutches that call the Black Desert their home, obsidian is one of the most common crafting materials available. Combine this ingredient with a powerful spellcaster and the xulgath tradition of inflection—magically warping and working normally inflexible stone—and the end result is an obsidian golem.

[[Demon]] worshippers in particular show a strong propensity toward creating obsidian golems, often designing these constructs in the image of their patron demon lord.
