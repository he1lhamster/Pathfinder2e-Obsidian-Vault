# Formian Worker

By far the most common formian on Akiton, workers are focused and industrious, naturally skilled at manual labor and coordinating with peers.

**Hive Mind** (divination, primal) Formians operate from a shared hive intelligence that allows them to communicate nearly instantaneously. While within telepathic range of at least one other formian from the same hive mind, a formian worker gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative checks, Perception checks, and saving throws against mental effects. If one formian is aware of a combatant, all members of the hive mind within range are aware of it.
