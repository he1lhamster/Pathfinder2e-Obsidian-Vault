# Rat Swarm

A swarm of rats can cause total chaos within a household or business. Contracting filth fever is all the easier when dozens of these agitated or hungry vermin gather to bite victims en masse, making rat-hunting a viable career in many parts of the world as desperate townspeople seek relief from the disease’s spread.
