# Xill

Xills visit the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], where they're often known as ethereal stalkers, primarily to maraud and to kidnap creatures back to their native [[DATABASE/plane/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]]. These four-armed, warmongering monsters paralyze their victims before implanting them with eggs using an ovipositor normally kept retracted behind their mandibles. Their single-minded drive to expand and conquer is so all-encompassing that while they work together dutifully and without dissent, there is little else in their lives.

###  The Ether War

Xills see [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] creatures as little more than incubators, but the need for fresh hosts never abates, for on their home plane, xills are constantly at war. Only the relative emptiness of the [[DATABASE/plane/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]] keeps their conflict with creatures like [[DATABASE/monster/Ether Spider|ether spiders]] from becoming too overwhelming and outpacing the speed at which new ranks of soldiers can replace those who have fallen.
