# Swordkeeper

Collectors who want to guard their magical arsenals procure or build swordkeepers. These constructs are equal parts display case and security system, each holding a single weapon within its body and projecting copies of the weapon it stores to deter would-be thieves.
**Recall Knowledge - Construct ([[Arcana]], [[Crafting]])**: DC 27
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 25
**Specific Lore**: DC 22

**Central Weapon** A swordkeeper's torso houses a single weapon of a level no higher than the swordkeeper. While the swordkeeper is operational, the chamber requires four successful DC 32 [[Thievery]] checks to [[Disable a Device]] to open; on a critical failure, the backlash deals 6d6 force damage (DC 30 basic Reflex save) to the creature attempting the check. If the swordkeeper is [[Immobilized]], [[Grabbed]], [[Prone]], or [[Stunned]], both DCs are reduced by 2. If the weapon is removed, the swordkeeper's echoblades vanish.

Echoblades inherit the weapon damage dice, weapon traits, and runes of the central weapon, but no other abilities or activations. The swordkeeper gains access to their critical specialization effects. The swordkeeper can have up to four echoblades at once; unattended echoblades vanish at the end of the swordkeeper's turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Raise Guard** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Effect** The swordkeeper raises an echoblade to protect itself, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of its next turn.</span>

###  Treasure Guardians

While the sample swordkeeper awards treasure based on its level, you can use a swordkeeper to provide PCs with a powerful or significant weapon—particularly an artifact or relic. To create a swordkeeper with a different weapon, replace the versatile P trait from its echoblade Strikes with those of the new weapon, change the weapon damage dice to match, and apply any runes. Unless you want to significantly change the swordkeeper's level, you should also adjust the Strike damage to make sure it's not too high or too low.
