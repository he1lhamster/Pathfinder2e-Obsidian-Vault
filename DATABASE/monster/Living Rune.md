# Living Rune

The most famous living runes are those of the ancient Runelords of Thassilon, resurging as Thassilon rebuilds in the modern era. Other living runes can be found, however, each with its own particular abilities. Living runes can also be crafted to deal different types of energy damage with their Strikes.
 **Divine**: Divine living runes are crafted by various churches and sects and typically bear the symbol of a deity, archdevil, or other divine force. Divine living runes replace [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] with [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] and have the following innate spells. 
**Divine Innate Spells** DC 35, attack +27; **7th** [[DATABASE/spell/Divine Decree|divine decree]] (×2); **6th** [[DATABASE/spell/Blade Barrier|blade barrier]], [[DATABASE/spell/Glyph of Warding|glyph of warding]] (at will), [[DATABASE/spell/Repulsion|repulsion]], [[DATABASE/spell/Spirit Blast|spirit blast]]; **5th** [[DATABASE/spell/Divine Wrath|divine wrath]] (×2), [[DATABASE/spell/Flame Strike|flame strike]] 
**Occult**: These runes are crafted by unknown hands and often left in out-of-the-way places. Occult living runes replace Arcana with [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] and have the following innate spells. 
**Occult Innate Spells** DC 35, attack +27; **7th** [[DATABASE/spell/Visions of Danger|visions of danger]] (×2); **6th** [[DATABASE/spell/Feeblemind|feeblemind]], [[DATABASE/spell/Glyph of Warding|glyph of warding]] (at will), [[DATABASE/spell/Phantasmal Calamity|phantasmal calamity]], [[DATABASE/spell/Vibrant Pattern|vibrant pattern]]; **5th** [[DATABASE/spell/Crushing Despair|crushing despair]] (×2), [[DATABASE/spell/Synesthesia|synesthesia]] (×2); **Cantrips (7th)** [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]]; **Constant (6th)** [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]] 
**Primal**: Primal living runes usually resemble animate carvings rather than lines of power or paint, and are often found on menhirs or sacred trees. Primal living runes replace Arcana with [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] and have the following innate spells. 
**Primal Innate Spells** DC 35, attack +27; **7th** [[DATABASE/spell/Volcanic Eruption|volcanic eruption]] (×2); **6th** [[DATABASE/spell/Baleful Polymorph|baleful polymorph]], [[DATABASE/spell/Flesh to Stone|flesh to stone]], [[DATABASE/spell/Glyph of Warding|glyph of warding]] (at will), [[DATABASE/spell/Tangling Creepers|tangling creepers]]; **5th** [[DATABASE/spell/Cone of Cold|cone of cold]] (×2), [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Fire|wall of fire]] (×2); **1st** [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Alignment|detect alignment]] (at will); **Constant (6th)** [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]]

<span class="in-box-ability">**Backdrop** When a creature attempts to Strike a living rune and critically misses, the attacker hits the surface (a canvas, wall, or so on) behind the living rune.

If the surface it's on is destroyed (such as a portrait hit by a [[DATABASE/spell/Fireball|fireball]] spell or a wall being smashed), the rune takes 7d6 damage and is shunted to the nearest flat surface. If there is no flat surface within 5 feet, the rune is destroyed</span>

###  Camouflage

Living runes are aware of the value of surprise attacks. They often hide themselves amongst other inscriptions or glyphs, observing foes for a time before striking, though clever adventurers who Investigate the inscriptions might notice the presence of the living rune. Living runes are also fond of setting up [[DATABASE/spell/Glyph of Warding|glyphs of warding]] as decoys and dummies.
