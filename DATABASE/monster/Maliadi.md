# Maliadi

A maliadi resembles a massive hippopotamus surrounded by a collar of flame. Maliadis are arrogant and tyrannical, and demand tribute from everyone they encounter—whether lone travelers or entire villages—to avert destruction. Many pay them off, for maliadis can hurl parts of their flaming collars to form geysers of flame or fiery walls, and they're also powerful shapeshifters.

###  Monstrous Pride

Due to their boundless arrogance, maliadis are unlikely to associate with others of their kind for extended periods, although they readily accept the services of smaller creatures they think might prove useful or expendable. They also dislike remaining in any form that doesn't convey their size and majesty for long. Those who know of a maliadi's hubris can often exploit it, such as by demanding a trial by combat to force the maliadi to leave an area alone.
