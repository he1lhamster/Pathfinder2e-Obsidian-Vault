# Queen Sluagh

A queen sluagh grows more powerful by devouring souls collected from underlings or drained directly through her proboscis. The muscular tongue inside is tipped with a cartilaginous, barbed quill that feeds the queen not only the soul, but the strengths of its owner. A queen conceals her nest deep in a secluded area, such as a forest or graveyard.
**Recall Knowledge - Fey ([[Nature]])**: DC 43
**Recall Knowledge - Undead ([[Religion]])**: DC 43
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 41
**Specific Lore**: DC 38

**Soulscent** (divination, occult) The sluagh is aware of all [[Doomed]] creatures, [[Dying]] creatures, and creatures that died within the last hour within the listed range.
**Voice of the Soul** A sluagh queen knows any language of a creature whose soul they've devoured and can perfectly mimic its voice by attempting a [[Deception]] check to [[Lie]], with a +4 circumstance bonus.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Call of the Damned** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (auditory) The queen sends out shriek to all sluagh within 1 mile, summoning them to her. This typically calls 2d4 [[Sluagh Reaper]]. If the queen is facing foes strong enough to threaten her, these are likely too weak to pose a threat but can assist by fetching items or getting in enemies' way.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Eat Soul** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (necromancy, occult) The queen touches a [[Dying]] creature or a creature that died within the past 1 hour with her proboscis. If the target is dying, it must attempt a DC 41 Fortitude save; on a failure, its dying value increases by 2 (3 on a critical failure). If the target is dead, the queen devours the soul. Unless the queen is destroyed, the target can't be returned to life through any means, even powerful magic such as [[Wish]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ghostly Swoop** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The queen sluagh becomes incorporeal until the start of their next turn, and [[Fly]] up to their fly Speed. While incorporeal, they are immune to precision damage, and have resistance 10 to all damage (except force, [[Ghost Touch]], or positive); this resistance is doubled against non-magical damage. After using Ghostly Swoop, the queen sluagh can't use it again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Soul Theft** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (occult, necromancy, negative) **Requirements** The queen has a creature [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] with her proboscis; **Effect** The queen devours a portion of the creature's soul and steals some of its ability. The creature takes 5d8 negative damage (DC 41 Fortitude save). The queen gains temporary HP equal to the total amount of HP the target loses, including any HP lost from being [[Drained]].
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature takes half damage and is drained 1.
 **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is drained 1 and [[Doomed]]. The queen steals a spell slot or training. If she steals a spell from a prepared caster, she transfers the spell to herself; if she steals from a spontaneous caster, she gains a prepared spell of the appropriate level and expends one of the creature's spell slots of that level. If she steals training, she chooses Perception, attack modifier, or any skill. For 24 hours, she gains a +2 status bonus to that statistic and the creature takes a –2 status penalty. The queen can have any number of stolen abilities, but only one from each creature.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but double damage.</span>
