# Pelegox

Pelegoxes are beings of condensed magnetic energy that fashion bodies for themselves using their surroundings. Though a pelegox's true form is a spherical core, it pulls metal fragments of various shapes and sizes to form a polyhedral shell. Though pelegoxes might develop preferences for a particular form when at rest, they continue to look for new configurations to call their own, happiest when they can experiment with endless possibilities, even if it means dismantling other metallic entities.
 These piecemeal creatures move by a combination of magnetic levitation and propulsion, and when that doesn't work, by continuously piercing the ground and shifting their weight forward, looking almost like moving caltrops. Over time, the magnetic signature of a pelegox becomes visible, etched into its body in patterns of concentric lines. These unique designs make it possible to distinguish between individual pelegoxes even when their surface has eroded.
 Pelegoxes are quick to form relationships with others of their kind. They delight in combining their individual bodies into ever larger, more elaborate structures and patterns. As such, it is rare to find a pelegox on their own— they prefer to travel in a clustered form.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Entrancing Shapes** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (mental, occult, visual) The pelegox cube rapidly shifts, creating a display of seemingly impossible geometric patterns. Creatures in a 60-foot cone take 9d6 mental damage (DC 29 basic Will save).

This is a 10-foot burst within 30 feet that deals 2d6+10 piercing damage (DC 27 basic Reflex save). When the troop is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Troop Movement** Whenever the troop Flies, it first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to its Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troop enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the entire troop.</span>

###  Refined Tastes

Less interested in arbitrary assignments of monetary value, pelegoxes prefer metals that display new forms or colors. They are as likely to trade a pure sphere of dawnsilver for a jagged piece of corroded copper as they are to keep a priceless djezet carving forever. However, even pelegoxes assign great value to [[DATABASE/equipment/Orichalcum|orichalcum]], as the skymetal's time-bending restorative properties grant the freedom to shape new configurations without being beholden to an unsatisfactory result.
