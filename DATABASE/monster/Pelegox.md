description: 'The pegasus is a winged horse prized for its capacity to serve as an
  aerial mount. Unfortunately for those who desire a saddle-trained pegasus, pegasi
  are wild creatures and do not readily accept even well-intentioned riders. Pegasi
  actively resist being mounted or controlled by evil creatures, attempting to buck
  an unwanted rider at every opportunity. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at
  the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet.<br/><br/> Pegasi
  are highly intelligent beasts and have a strong sense of pride and honor. The best
  way to entreat a pegasus is by speaking to it with grace and offering gifts appropriate
  to a creature of such majesty. Prospective riders who seek the mount for a worthy
  cause or virtuous quest have a much easier time coaxing a pegasus into granting
  its favor. Regardless, a pegasus never accepts a bit or saddle, for reasons both
  practical (a standard horse saddle interferes with its wings) and purely egotistical.<br/><br/>
  In the wild, pegasi live in small herds and establish territories on remote mountains
  where they are relatively safe from hunters and slavers. They mature at the same
  rate as horses and can even breed with other equines, though the outcome of such
  unions is typically a foal with the traits of its least magical parent. On rare
  occasions, the interbreeding of a pegasus and a unicorn may result in a winged unicorn
  with characteristics of both parents and an unrivaled sense of righteousness.<br/><br/>
  Some pegasi carry in them the blood of a mighty and heroic ancestor. These champions
  of pegasus-kind dedicate their long lives to the pursuit of justice. They possess
  powerful supernatural abilities to aid them in this fight, such as resistance to
  fire and poison, immunity to petrification, and holy hoof attacks.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall

# Pelegox

Pelegoxes are beings of condensed magnetic energy that fashion bodies for themselves using their surroundings. Though a pelegox's true form is a spherical core, it pulls metal fragments of various shapes and sizes to form a polyhedral shell. Though pelegoxes might develop preferences for a particular form when at rest, they continue to look for new configurations to call their own, happiest when they can experiment with endless possibilities, even if it means dismantling other metallic entities.
 These piecemeal creatures move by a combination of magnetic levitation and propulsion, and when that doesn't work, by continuously piercing the ground and shifting their weight forward, looking almost like moving caltrops. Over time, the magnetic signature of a pelegox becomes visible, etched into its body in patterns of concentric lines. These unique designs make it possible to distinguish between individual pelegoxes even when their surface has eroded.
 Pelegoxes are quick to form relationships with others of their kind. They delight in combining their individual bodies into ever larger, more elaborate structures and patterns. As such, it is rare to find a pelegox on their own— they prefer to travel in a clustered form.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Entrancing Shapes** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (mental, occult, visual) The pelegox cube rapidly shifts, creating a display of seemingly impossible geometric patterns. Creatures in a 60-foot cone take 9d6 mental damage (DC 29 basic Will save).

This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troop enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the entire troop.</span>

###  Refined Tastes

Less interested in arbitrary assignments of monetary value, pelegoxes prefer metals that display new forms or colors. They are as likely to trade a pure sphere of dawnsilver for a jagged piece of corroded copper as they are to keep a priceless djezet carving forever. However, even pelegoxes assign great value to [[DATABASE/equipment/Orichalcum|orichalcum]], as the skymetal's time-bending restorative properties grant the freedom to shape new configurations without being beholden to an unsatisfactory result.
