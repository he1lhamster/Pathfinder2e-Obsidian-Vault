# Mosquito Witch

With unclear origins and even more mysterious powers, the Mosquito Witch's exact statistics and abilities might change depending upon her true nature in a given campaign. What follows is a representative rendition of the Witch and her core abilities. In addition, this article includes three variations of the Mosquito Witch, each embodying one of her enduring mythologies by providing a handful of additional abilities. Add or remove these abilities to create the Shimmerford cryptid of your imagination, and remember that the spookiest legends are often the ones the PCs barely encounter directly.

**Swarmsense** The Mosquito Witch receives constant updates from nearby insects and can use her touch as an imprecise sense at the listed range as long as there are insects around to guide her.
**Wild Empathy** The Mosquito Witch can use [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on and make [[DATABASE/action/Request|Requests]] of arthropods (insects, spiders, and similar invertebrates like bloodseekers). Most arthropods have a starting attitude of [[DATABASE/condition/Indifferent|indifferent]] to the Mosquito Witch.

### The Hemoprophet

Already versed in several folk divinations like dowsing and reading patterns in windblown winnowed husks, Shimmerford residents swiftly attributed divinatory powers to the Mosquito Witch.
 This “hemoprophet” aspect can supposedly smell conundrums, and she visits those facing difficult decisions or mysteries in their dreams. The witch offers an answer to the dreamer's deepest question, and if the dreamer accepts, the witch drinks their blood as they sleep, tastes their options, and leaves an answer nearby, written with some of the stolen fluids. This Mosquito Witch isn't necessarily malicious, but neither does she worry about draining too much or painting embarrassing blood-truths for all of Shimmerford to see. The blood's weight makes her footfalls heavy, and hunters often remark that especially deep tracks left by anyone are “heavy with answers” in homage to the Witch.
 The Hemoprophet variant gains the following abilities.
 **Bloodbelly** The Mosquito Witch steals and stores stolen blood to power her divinations. Whenever she deals piercing damage, the Mosquito Witch can gain an equal number of Blood Points, to a maximum of 100 Blood Points. She becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] so long as she has at least 40 Blood Points stored, or [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 2]] if she has at least 80 Blood Points stored. **Slurp** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature adjacent to the Mosquito Witch takes [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]; **Effect** The Mosquito Witch slurps up some of the creature's blood and gains Blood Points equal to the bleed damage dealt.
 **Occult Innate Spells** DC 29; **7th** [[DATABASE/spell/Retrocognition|retrocognition]] (×3); **6th** [[DATABASE/spell/Object Reading|object reading]] (×3), [[DATABASE/spell/Scrying|scrying]] (×3); **5th** [[DATABASE/spell/Locate|locate]] (×3), [[DATABASE/spell/Prying Eye|prying eye]] (×3); **4th** [[DATABASE/spell/Read Omens|read omens]] (×3); **3rd** [[DATABASE/spell/Wanderer's Guide|wanderer's guide]] (×3)
 **Prophecy in Red** The Mosquito Witch can't Cast an occult Spell without simultaneously expending a number of Blood Points equal to 10 × the spell's level.

### The Legion Leech

Mosquitoes are parasites. Like her namesake, the Mosquito Witch wanders the world before alighting in an unguarded area to drain it of life and happiness. Once sated, she withdraws to digest her stolen vitality.
 This Legion Leech is associated with inexplicable wasting sicknesses, bloodseekers bold enough to carry off lambs, and ravenous mosquito swarms that cover and drain a bull dead in moments. Whereas other aspects are occasionally helpful or curious, the Legion Leech cares for little beyond snuffing out life.
 This variant learns the [[DATABASE/ritual/Mosquito Blight|mosquito blight]] ritual, which she uses to create a huge area of deadly disease.

### The Swamp Seer

Few have seen the Mosquito Witch, yet almost everyone has suffered her namesake vermin at some point in time. Shimmerford summer skies shimmer with flies hatching from the river and myriad creeks, and “wherever pests fly, the Witch can spy.” In her Swarm Seer aspect, the Mosquito Witch is a haunting predator and verminous voyeur whose sanguineous appetites are equal to her fascination with societies. She keeps tabs on every inhabitant with parasocial glee, obsessing over their superstitions and abandoned trinkets—especially any representations of herself.
 This Mosquito Witch rarely acts with outright malice or to bring direct harm to those around her. However, her haunting appearance, alien values, and tendency to express emotions with sky-blotting swarms inspires terror in her neighbors. Depending on the circumstances she might represent a fearsome and ineffable ally, a demigod of fecundity, or a terrible foe who long ago lost patience with humanity.
 The Swarm Seer variant gains the following abilities.
 **Perception** +22; [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]], swarmsense (imprecise) 100 feet, swarmsight (precise) 20 feet
 **Swarmsight** The Mosquito Witch can feel anything in contact with her obscuring host and can use her touch as a precise sense at the listed range.
 **Obscuring Host** (aura) 20 feet. A thick swarm of mosquitoes surrounds the Mosquito Witch, creating [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealment]] in the aura. A creature that begins its turn in the emanation becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] unless it succeeds at a DC 26 Fortitude save. The Mosquito Witch and arthropods can see through this aura and are immune to its sickened effect.
 **Fecund Wounds** Insect larvae clog and wriggle out of open wounds within 100 feet of the Mosquito Witch. A creature that takes bleed damage in the area also becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] for 1 round. **Primal Innate Spells** DC 29; **3rd** [[DATABASE/spell/Animal Vision|animal vision]] (at will); **2nd** [[DATABASE/spell/Animal Messenger|animal messenger]] (at will); **Cantrips (5th)** [[DATABASE/spell/Dancing Lights|dancing lights]]; **Constant** [[DATABASE/spell/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]]
