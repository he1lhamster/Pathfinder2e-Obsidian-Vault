# Graul

The labyrinthine caverns and tunnels beneath Highhelm are home to many dangers, with the insidious graul being one of the more notable native species. These highly specialized ambush predators possess a natural camouflage that renders them completely imperceptible to all forms of darkvision as they float silently through the darkness, allowing them to hunt creatures that rely on specialized senses to navigate their lightless domain. Surprisingly cunning, grauls are adept at using their magical talents for illusion and mimicry to separate potential prey from allies and light sources alike.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Paralysis** (poison, incapacitation) A living creature struck by a graul's jaws attack must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]]. It can attempt a new check at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such check. A creature paralyzed by this ability is also affected by the graul's darkvision invisibility for as long as the effect persists.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Seize** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** The graul has a creature [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] with its tentacle; **Effect** The graul pulls the creature toward itself. The graul attempts an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the creature's Fortitude DC. With a success, the graul pulls the creature 15 feet closer to it.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Sound Mimicry** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The graul can perfectly imitate the sounds and speech of other creatures by attempting a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check against a listener's Will DC. The graul doesn't need to understand the language it's mimicking, but when speaking a language it doesn't know, the creature can only repeat specific words and phrases it has heard in the past 24 hours. The graul can't use this ability to duplicate voice-based abilities or spells.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tentacle Grab** A creature hit by the graul's tentacle becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] by the graul. The creature isn't [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the graul's tentacle. A creature can sever the tentacle with a Strike against AC 18 that deals at least 10 slashing damage. This deals no damage to the graul but prevents it from using its tentacle Strike until it regrows the tentacle, which takes 1 round. The graul can move without ending the Grab as long as the creature remains within the tentacle's reach.</span>

###  Photophobia

Although grauls are not harmed or physically affected by light, the overwhelming sensation of vulnerability they experience when directly exposed drives them to avoid it wherever possible. Travelers through the tunnels surrounding Highhelm are advised to be on the lookout for blind and darkvision-possessing fauna that appear to be congregating and making homes near bioluminescent fungi clusters or other natural light sources they might normally ignore, as this behavior often indicates the presence of a graul's hunting ground.
