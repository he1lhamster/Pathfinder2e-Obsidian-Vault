# Melixie

Melixies are hyperactive insect sprites with legendary sweet tooths, capable of drinking down honey, nectar, sugar, and other sweets in alarming quantities. Melixies take the insectile wings common among winged fey and up the ante with antennae and additional insect features, typically shared with bees but sometimes with butterflies, moths, ladybugs, or other beetles. Melixies live in a pattern of rapid consumption of sweets, incredible productivity in tasks of all sorts, and then a crash to sleep it all off and start again. Melixies in their productive state even engage happily in large-scale repetitive tasks that most sprites find dreadfully dull. In their spare time, melixies love to dance, and some of them learn a dancelike sign language called Melisylvan, allowing them to communicate a full range of information through movement.

As soon as the rush ends, the melixie is [[Fatigued]] for 1 minute.</span>

###  Minature Desserts

While most melixies gobble up any sweets they find, those who can resist eating the raw ingredients for long enough learn to use them create incredibly small desserts in a startling variety of styles and flavors. Some members of larger ancestries even enjoy the way that a tray of melixie desserts allows them to experience so many different flavors before becoming full.
