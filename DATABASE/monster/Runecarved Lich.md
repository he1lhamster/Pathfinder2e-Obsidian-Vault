# Runecarved Lich

In their relentless pursuit of more magical might, some liches use their rotting forms to hold magical secrets, hiding precious tomes in their ribcage, inscribing formulas on their withered flesh, even replacing some bones with powerful magical items. The process is painstaking, as the _soul cage_ tries to repair any damage caused by such alterations.

## Creating A Runecarved Lich

A runecarved lich trades Drain Soul Cage and paralyzing touch for the arm wands and summon weapon abilities. The spell tome and related abilities are acquired by giving up one spell slot of each level they can cast. Some runecarved liches might have other special abilities instead, placing [[Aeon Stone]] in empty eye sockets, reinforcing themselves with armor plates bearing powerful runes, or even creating reservoirs filled with alchemical poisons or bombs that pose little danger to the lich but are deadly to those who strike too hard with a bludgeoning attack.
**Recall Knowledge - Undead ([[Religion]])**: DC 44
