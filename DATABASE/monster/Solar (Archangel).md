description: "Solar ibis are beings of light sometimes called sun birds, or \u201C\
  winged luminaries\u201D by the more scholarly inclined. They're tasked with guarding\
  \ sacred places or items, although they sometimes also protect the living from places\
  \ of incredible danger. Their appearance is always preceded by numerous small purple-winged\
  \ birds with a splash of yellow on their crowns; these are avatars of the ibis that\
  \ nest and congregate in areas it protects. The presence of these avatars is often\
  \ the only way to track these reclusive and solitary creatures. Should the solar\
  \ ibis choose to appear, these little birds scatter like wild fowl. The sun bird\
  \ then manifests and bathes the area in a brilliant shower of light that can blind\
  \ and startle unwary and unprepared creatures in its presence.<br/><br/> The solar\
  \ ibis appears as a magnificent, large bird surrounded by a halo of brilliant light.\
  \ Its black feathers shimmer with all the colors of the spectrum, casting glossy\
  \ rainbows across its plumage. It has a keen sense of insight, which it uses to\
  \ pass judgment as a whole on whether those before it are worthy to access what\
  \ it guards. It punishes those it finds unworthy with its cleansing might.<br/><br/>\
  \ Though considered sacred by most within the Mwangi Expanse, there are still some\
  \ who hunt these glorious creatures; some seek the treasures that the ibis keep,\
  \ while others seek the ibis themselves, dead or alive. Some believe that the feathers\
  \ of a solar ibis, when burned, create an incense that can grant holy power to those\
  \ that inhale it. Others believe that its bones and feet can be ground into a powder\
  \ that can destroy demons and purify the undead.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge\

# Solar (Archangel)

Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right hand of a deity or champion a cause that benefits an entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed. A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane.

###  Solar Genesis

Unlike most angels, solars are created from divine energy, sometimes blended with good souls. They are joined in this distinction by the ancient empyrean angels.
