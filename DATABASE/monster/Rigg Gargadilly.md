<span class="in-box-ability">**Slow Susceptibility** The quickling takes a –2 status penalty to saving throws against effects that cause the [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] condition. If the quickling ever becomes slowed, they lose their supernatural speed, can't Fade from View, and become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] for the duration of the slow. They also can't reduce this sickened condition for the duration of the slowed effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Can't Catch Me <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** The quickling is targeted by a Strike **Effect** The quickling darts aside, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, then Strides up to half their Speed after the Strike resolves.</span>

As long as they have a firm surface to travel across, they can Stride their full movement vertically or horizontally. They can even run across unstable surfaces, such as water, in the same way, although dangerous surfaces (acid, lava, etc.) harm them as normal. They must end their movement on a horizontal surface capable of bearing their weight or else they fall.</span>
