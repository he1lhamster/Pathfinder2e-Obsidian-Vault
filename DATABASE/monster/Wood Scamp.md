# Wood Scamp

A wood scamp's veiny, bat-like wings mimic the lamina and venules of a leaf. This, along with their stout green torsos and limbs, enables them to easily blend into the branches of a living tree. They're unusually social for scamps and prefer to work in groups when possible. By their nature, they find their home plane rather boring, and many of them are abuzz with excitement as the plane reopens. They're eager to travel to new places where they can cause mischief.
