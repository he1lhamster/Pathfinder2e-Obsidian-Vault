# Deghuun (Children Of Mhar)

Mhar, an ancient evil deity of caverns, mountains, and volcanoes, belongs to the pantheon of the Great Old Ones—monstrous beings of alien intellect and unfathomable power. The so-called children of Mhar (known as deghuuns in the chaotic tongues of Mhar's enraptured cultists) physically resemble blue-gray octopods made of stone, mud, and molten iron. Venthole-like craters dot the surface of a deghuun's body, through which the creature can gaze out with a single golden eye that it can move from crater to crater.

###  Scions of the Elder Mythos

Children of Mhar are not the only agents of the Great Old Ones and Outer Gods to emerge on Golarion. [[DATABASE/monster/Gibbering Mouther|Gibbering mouthers]] supposedly have some connection to unholy Abhoth, and the ancestors of the Darklands-dwelling chardas were once potent clerics of Orgesh, the Faceless God.
