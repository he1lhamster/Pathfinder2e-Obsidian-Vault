# Eagle

These large birds of prey swoop down from incredible heights to snatch fish and small mammals in their powerful talons. Eagles nest atop high trees or steep cliffs that provide a commanding view of the surrounding area. They avoid nesting too near civilization, but some remote cultures train eagles as hunting companions.
