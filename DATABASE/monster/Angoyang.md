# Angoyang

Angoyangs resemble white cats with black stripes like those of a tiger. They have beautifully silken fur, piercing blue eyes, and long fluffy tails. Yet, far from the picturesque feline companions they appear to be, angoyangs are actually terrifying beasts capable of peeling back the fleshy layers of their face to reveal a mass of long, toothed tentacles.
 Although most cats instinctively avoid areas where angoyangs roam, the unlucky felines who do encounter this creature are invariably entangled in the monster's toothy tentacles and devoured. In cities and towns where angoyangs reside, cat owners may find that their beloved pets have gone missing only to soon have a fluffy black-and-white cat coincidentally appear at their doorstep, looking up at them with wide eyes and mewing adorably. Angoyangs almost never attack their caretakers, who they see as loyal servants that feed, clean up after, and pamper them, and the creatures protect the people in their household from any would-be intruders. However, a caretaker who mistreats or neglects their angoyang ward is often met with a grisly fate. More than one coroner or gravedigger has inadvertently inherited an angoyang after being assigned to clean up the mutilated remains of a previous “owner.”

###  Lucky Cat?

Due to their appearance as cats and their monstrous intellect, angoyangs are skilled at getting around unnoticed and often collect useful trinkets and information for their own mysterious purposes. Sometimes an angoyang will leave their stolen valuables inside the homes of “lucky” individuals. Such individuals may find small valuables, coins, or notes with trade secrets in their shoes and pockets and believe them to be a divine blessing. However, the angoyang's motives are likely far from benign.
