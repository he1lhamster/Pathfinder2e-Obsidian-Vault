# Blodeuwedd

The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the boundaries between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[First World]] have worn thin, or around portals between the two planes. Their link with such regions of the natural world is so strong that it rivals the bond shared between [[Nymph]] and places of great natural beauty, yet none would look upon a blodeuwedd and mistake them for something as elegant as a nymph.
Although blodeuwedds share certain traits with nymphs, their role as guardians of the pathways between this world and the First World prevents them from forming as powerful a magical bond with the natural world. Never truly a part of either reality yet forced to keep watch over both, blodeuwedds tend to grow cynical and sharp-tongued toward any who would seek travel from one realm to the other, regardless of their actual goals.

**Allergen Aura** (aura, primal) A blodeuwedd exudes a 30-foot aura of pollen and irritating allergens. A non-plant living creature that begins its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or become [[Sickened]]. A creature that succeeds at its save is then temporarily immune to the allergen aura for 24 hours. A blodeuwedd can suppress this aura or activate it again as a free action.
**Wild Empathy** The blodeuwedd can use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make an Impression]] on and make very simple [[Request]] of animals.

###  Blodeuwedds and Nymphs

[[Nymph]] often think of blodeuwedds as uncouth or too wild, while the reverse holds true for blodeuwedds, who consider nymphs to be spoiled and pampered “princesses” who take the beautiful parts of the world in which they dwell for granted. It speaks volumes to blodeuwedds' strength of personality that they don't let these bitter emotions control them. Very few of their kind drift into actual evil—yet likewise, very few of them display the kindness that nymphs do.
