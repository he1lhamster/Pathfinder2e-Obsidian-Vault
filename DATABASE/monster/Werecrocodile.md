###  Creating Werecreatures

Werecreatures are complex monsters capable of shifting between three different forms and inflicting their condition upon other humanoids. Full rules for building werecreatures, along with how to apply the werecreature's curse, appear on pages 328–329 of the Pathfinder Bestiary. Rules for PCs or NPCs with werecreature abilities are found on page 81 of the Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide.
