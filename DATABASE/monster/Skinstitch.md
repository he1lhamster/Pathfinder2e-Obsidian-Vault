# Skinstitch

Skinstitches' hulking frames are made from flayed humanoid skin stuffed with straw and poisonous insects. The dark god [[Norgorber]] grants the secrets for creating these monstrosities in disturbing dreams he sends to select adherents, in which the dreamer imagines themself skinning a beloved pet, friend, or family member. Those that accept these teachings become skinstitchers. The creation of a skinstitch is a crude process compared to the making of a more advanced construct like a [[Golem]]. Rough stitching, imprecise shapes, and shoddy materials give a skinstitch its patchwork appearance.
 While most skinstitches have vaguely humanoid shapes, they often appear monstrous due to various modifications their creators have made to their bodies. Some skinstitches' arms, for instance, might bear jagged metal blades or blunt iron rods. The most talented skinstitchers rarely bother with the humanoid form at all and instead opt to craft skinstitches that resemble other creatures sacred to Norgorber, such as scorpions, centipedes, or spiders. Rumors lurk of skinstitchers who can use exotic materials like steel, daemon flesh, or even magical shadows for their creations.
 The rotting materials used to build skinstitches tend to attract vermin, which can in turn form a hive or nest within the creations' bodies. Skinstitchers consider the presence of such tenants to be a sure sign of Norgorber's approval.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Pest Haven** The rotting hides and molding straw stuffing of skinstitches are ideal nesting grounds for vermin and insect swarms. Any animal swarm sharing a space with a skinstitch gains [[Fast Healing]] 3. Additionally, if a creature deals at least 10 piercing or slashing damage to the skinstitch at once, the swarm can use its swarming bites Strike (or similar attack) against the attacker as a reaction.</span>

###  Skitterstitch

Skitterstitches are eight-legged skinstitches crafted to resemble giant spiders. These elite skinstitch variants have different attacks from the standard [[Skinstitch]], including a deadly poison. Skitterstitches always house [[Spider Swarm]] within their bodies, which scuttle forth when their host is destroyed.
