# Azata, Aeolaeka

Aeolaekas, also known as stone azatas, embody the slow but inevitable chaos of rock itself. Stone is often thought to be steadfast and unchanging, but, when viewed on a grander scale over vast periods of time, stone can transform into things as diverse as intricate crystals and fine powder. To the aeolaeka, anything that could become either sand or diamond is the very incarnation of the chaos of reality—just on a slower scale. As a result of their stone affinity, aeolaekas are less capricious than other azatas, and some have willingly forged lasting accords or agreements with mortals. Stone-skinned aeolaekas are sometimes mistaken for statues and use this fact to hide in plain sight when they don't want their presence known.

###  Elemental Allies

Aeolaekas often visit the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]]. There, they fight against evil [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Earth|earth elementals]] or simply wander the veins and tunnels of that realm as they bask in its stony wonders. Aeolaekas often ally with elementals, particularly against evil fire creatures like [[DATABASE/monster/Salamander|salamanders]].
