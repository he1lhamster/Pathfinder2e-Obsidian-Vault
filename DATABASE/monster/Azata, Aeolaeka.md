description: "The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white\
  \ dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly\
  \ all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull,\
  \ though this does not make them any less dangerous\u2014in fact, it may mean the\
  \ opposite. It\u2019s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because\
  \ they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don\u2019t care to. They\
  \ are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed\
  \ at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes,\
  \ and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking\u2014and when the attack comes,\
  \ it\u2019s bloody and relentless.<br/><br/> Thankfully, white dragons prefer very\
  \ cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops\
  \ or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them\
  \ as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other\
  \ creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon\u2019s territory, then\
  \ bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect\
  \ all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility\u2014\
  such as tools, trade goods, and fine food\u2014over coins or jewels. The ability\
  \ to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications,\
  \ and they take great pride in how they\u2019ve decorated their homes over the years.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Azata, Aeolaeka

Aeolaekas, also known as stone azatas, embody the slow but inevitable chaos of rock itself. Stone is often thought to be steadfast and unchanging, but, when viewed on a grander scale over vast periods of time, stone can transform into things as diverse as intricate crystals and fine powder. To the aeolaeka, anything that could become either sand or diamond is the very incarnation of the chaos of reality—just on a slower scale. As a result of their stone affinity, aeolaekas are less capricious than other azatas, and some have willingly forged lasting accords or agreements with mortals. Stone-skinned aeolaekas are sometimes mistaken for statues and use this fact to hide in plain sight when they don't want their presence known.

###  Elemental Allies

Aeolaekas often visit the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]]. There, they fight against evil [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Earth|earth elementals]] or simply wander the veins and tunnels of that realm as they bask in its stony wonders. Aeolaekas often ally with elementals, particularly against evil fire creatures like [[DATABASE/monster/Salamander|salamanders]].
