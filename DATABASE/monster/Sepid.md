# Sepid

Sepids are the brutal warlords of the divs, delighting in violence against mortals and their own particular flavor of vengeance. Inveterate liars, sepids can't help but spout the most outrageous lies, and their form and nature represent the power of falsehoods to snowball into violence that can cost countless lives. Among mortals, they rally troops to incite rebellion, war, and other forms of carnage, savoring mortals who slaughter each other. These giant beings usually stand around 13 feet tall; they wade through battlefields seeking out heroes and generals, rejoicing maniacally as they cut their foes down.

###  Sepid Deceptions

Given that sepids always do the opposite of what they say they will, it might seem difficult for these divs to deceive anyone, which is far from the truth. Often, sepids avoid making statements about their own intentions and instead give orders or speak in analogies, riddles, and anecdotes, allowing those they manipulate to parse out their rationales with clever forms of deception.
