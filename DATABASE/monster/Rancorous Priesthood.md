# Rancorous Priesthood

Followers of [[DATABASE/deity/Rovagug|Rovagug]] must usually conceal their devotion to the Rough Beast, hiding in remote cave complexes or abandoned ruins; but they emerge from these strongholds when they sense weakness, gathering together into a destructive, homicidal mob to hunt down high-ranking priests of rival deities or slaughter entire towns. Alternatively, if their hidden bolthole is compromised, a mob of Rovagug's faithful might emerge—not hoping to save themselves, but intent only on taking their enemies with them as they die.

Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius is not affected).

###  Troops with Spells

Though [[DATABASE/deity/Rovagug|Rovagug's]] followers are the most common, other deities might have rancorous priesthoods. You can use these statistics to represent other troops capable of casting spells simply by replacing the spells in the list and altering the alignment. Limit the troop to spells with a normal level no higher than 2 below what a creature of the troop's level would normally be able to cast; you can heighten some of these spells to fill the troop's highest-level spell slots, representing the combined effect of several lower-level spells cast at the same time.
