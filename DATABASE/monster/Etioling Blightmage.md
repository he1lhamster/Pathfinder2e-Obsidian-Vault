description: 'When the primal spark of the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]]
  nestled in a [[DATABASE/ancestry/Gnome|gnome''s]] heart is engulfed in <i>Radiant
  Fire</i>, it fights back, pushing against death with riotous life and creating an
  etioling. Within their small frames, churning positive and negative energy fiercely
  battle for dominance, occasionally causing convulsions and babbling speech. This
  intense inner conflict warps an etioling''s primal magic, transmogrifying it into
  an occult hybrid singular to these unfortunate mortics.<br/><br/> Nearly devoid
  of color, etiolings have vibrant eyes and pulsing green veins. Their bodies force
  the corrupting negative energy out through their pores, where it distills on their
  skin, covering them in a thin layer of ectoplasm and concentrated death. Around
  them, the world withers.<br/><br/> Incapable of focusing for long, etiolings are
  impulsive and moody, rapidly alternating between kindness, malice, and trickery.

# Etioling

When the primal spark of the [[First World]] nestled in a [[Gnome]] heart is engulfed in _Radiant Fire_, it fights back, pushing against death with riotous life and creating an etioling. Within their small frames, churning positive and negative energy fiercely battle for dominance, occasionally causing convulsions and babbling speech. This intense inner conflict warps an etioling's primal magic, transmogrifying it into an occult hybrid singular to these unfortunate mortics.
 Nearly devoid of color, etiolings have vibrant eyes and pulsing green veins. Their bodies force the corrupting negative energy out through their pores, where it distills on their skin, covering them in a thin layer of ectoplasm and concentrated death. Around them, the world withers.
 Incapable of focusing for long, etiolings are impulsive and moody, rapidly alternating between kindness, malice, and trickery. They forget themselves, their friends, and the things they once loved.
