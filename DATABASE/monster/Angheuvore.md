# Angheuvore

Angheuvores, or mortic [[DATABASE/ancestry/Elf|elves]], have an insatiable hunger for raw humanoid flesh— though they're reluctant to feed on other elves. Most stalk the streets of human nations, such as Druma, Razmiran, and the River Kingdoms. Impatient and impulsive, they're opportunistic hunters, preying on the wounded and isolated.

###  Scholarly Pursuits

Angheuvores retain the elven love of education, although the topics that interest them are decidedly macabre. Many study anatomy, haruspicy, medicine, pain, putrefaction, or trauma, preferring hands-on experiments and research whenever possible.
