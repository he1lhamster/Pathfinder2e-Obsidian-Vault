description: 'Angazhanis lurk in the depths of the world''s jungles, where these sapient,
  four-armed apes prey on any creatures they deem lesser than themselves. They''re
  purportedly the divine minions of [[DATABASE/deity/Angazhan|Angazhan]] , demon lord
  of apes. While many angazhanis do worship this foul god, scarce evidence exists
  to support their claim to fiendish heritage. Jungle-dwelling people know well to
  steer clear of suspected angazhani territories; angazhanis of such areas don''t
  slaughter outright, often capturing trespassers to serve as slaves or as living
  sacrifices in heinous rituals.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Beast</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]]

# Angheuvore

Angheuvores, or mortic [[DATABASE/ancestry/Elf|elves]], have an insatiable hunger for raw humanoid flesh— though they're reluctant to feed on other elves. Most stalk the streets of human nations, such as Druma, Razmiran, and the River Kingdoms. Impatient and impulsive, they're opportunistic hunters, preying on the wounded and isolated.

###  Scholarly Pursuits

Angheuvores retain the elven love of education, although the topics that interest them are decidedly macabre. Many study anatomy, haruspicy, medicine, pain, putrefaction, or trauma, preferring hands-on experiments and research whenever possible.
