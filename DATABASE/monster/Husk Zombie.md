# Husk Zombie

Rather than allow a body to rot, some necromancers attempt to dry-cure the corpse to prevent further deterioration. Combined with special reagents, this process can preserve a rudimentary form of intelligence, allowing husk zombies to act more like predators than their mindless kin. Most husk zombies have no memories of their prior lives, though some keep trinkets from that time, oblivious as to why they value such items. A rare few husk zombies retain most of their former knowledge, though they tend to have gaps in their memory.

###  Saved Sentience

The rituals to make husk zombies (and withered zombies) require extra steps that involve applying special herbs or tonics to the body before burial. Whether the process preserves the creature's memories is unpredictable at best. For most necromancers, this additional preparation seems like a waste of time as they prefer the total obedience of a mindless zombie. Though most husk zombies want only to hunt and kill, a few try to maintain a more balanced, even cosmopolitan lifestyle.
