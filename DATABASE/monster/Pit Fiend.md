description: "When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellfire,\
  \ it is likely that one of Hell\u2019s most powerful and diabolical generals, the\
  \ pit fiend, masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit fiends\
  \ often serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal\
  \ worlds, and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated\
  \ ferocity. To realize their tyrannical machinations, pit fiends claim mortal souls\
  \ that they corrupt into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed\
  \ through infernal manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell\u2019\
  s formidable legions. They often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for\
  \ their armies, drawing upon these lesser devils\u2019 depravity during powerful\
  \ magical ceremonies to create hideous and terrifying abominations that can cow\
  \ and eviscerate the pit fiend\u2019s enemies.<br/><br/> Pit fiends themselves are\
  \ crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus, the ninth layer of Hell,\
  \ to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes. Those pit fiends that don\u2019\
  t leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper layers of Hell often form\
  \ the courts of Hell\u2019s elite, gathering cabals and sects that shape Hell\u2019\
  s political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many pit fiends see\
  \ themselves as living embodiments of hellfire, the all-encompassing wrath of Hell,\
  \ and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by fire. In Avernus, Dis, Malebolge,\
  \ Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit fiends build vast citadels of brimstone wreathed in\
  \ flame to lord over.<br/><br/> Pit fiends tower over other devils, standing at\
  \ least 16 feet tall, weighing over 1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess\
  \ of 20 feet. <h3 class=\"title\">Infernal Dukes</h3> Elite members of Hell\u2019\
  s political infrastructure and leadership hierarchy, the dukes of Hell are chosen\
  \ from among the most tyrannical, oppressive, and conniving devils. While not all\
  \ infernal dukes are pit fiends, a pit fiend\u2019s natural disposition toward conquest\
  \ and oppression often make it an ideal candidate for this position. To create an\
  \ infernal duke, adjust the pit fiend to be between 21st and 25th level. Because\
  \ of their physical prowess, manipulative nature, and powerful spellcasting abilities,\
  \ infernal dukes make excellent villains for long-running campaigns.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Pit Fiend (Tyrant Devil)

When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellfire, it is likely that one of Hell’s most powerful and diabolical generals, the pit fiend, masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit fiends often serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal worlds, and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated ferocity. To realize their tyrannical machinations, pit fiends claim mortal souls that they corrupt into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed through infernal manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell’s formidable legions. They often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies, drawing upon these lesser devils’ depravity during powerful magical ceremonies to create hideous and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the pit fiend’s enemies.
 Pit fiends themselves are crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus, the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes. Those pit fiends that don’t leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper layers of Hell often form the courts of Hell’s elite, gathering cabals and sects that shape Hell’s political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many pit fiends see themselves as living embodiments of hellfire, the all-encompassing wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by fire. In Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit fiends build vast citadels of brimstone wreathed in flame to lord over.
 Pit fiends tower over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over 1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet.

While not all infernal dukes are pit fiends, a pit fiend’s natural disposition toward conquest and oppression often make it an ideal candidate for this position. To create an infernal duke, adjust the pit fiend to be between 21st and 25th level.
