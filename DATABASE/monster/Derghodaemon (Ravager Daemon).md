# Derghodaemon (Ravager Daemon)

Derghodaemons represent death through unfathomable violence and being eaten alive. Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to bits for stew, a werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the elements and became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inflict the same twisted and bloody ends upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths—to these fiends, the quicker they can enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim and repeat the violent cycle.
Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long— the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience severe visual warping. The derghodaemon's appearance becomes more and more twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous urges to inflict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horrific attack derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming infestation—the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death, provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp of the insects' bodies don't drive them to violent fury first!

Whether or not the targets are hit, each must attempt a DC 31 Reflex save (at a –2 circumstance penalty if it was actually hit by the swarm spit). [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|Persistent damage]] caused by the swarming infestation ends as soon as the creature takes any amount of damage from an area effect. The derghodaemon can't use this ability for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Success **The swarm disperses as soon as it deals its swarm spit Strike damage. 
**Success **The swarm clings to the target and infests it, dealing 1d6 persistent piercing damage. 
**Failure **The swarm clings to the target and infests it, dealing 2d6 persistent piercing damage. 
**Critical Failure **As failure, but the hissing sounds caused by the infestation also cause the target to become [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round; this additional effect has the auditory, emotion, and mental traits.</span>
