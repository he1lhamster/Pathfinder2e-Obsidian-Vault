description: 'Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these
  malevolent humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing
  beyond the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek
  slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and
  merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens
  dress themselves in flowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their
  aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns
  and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.<br/><br/>Above the fierce captains
  who command the infamous black ships are an even higher caste of denizens of Leng.
  These cultists and musicians serve as high priests, laboring to appease the frightening
  gods who look down upon the Nightmare Realm with cold malice.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall

# Derghodaemon (Ravager Daemon)

Derghodaemons represent death through unfathomable violence and being eaten alive. Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to bits for stew, a werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the elements and became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inflict the same twisted and bloody ends upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths—to these fiends, the quicker they can enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim and repeat the violent cycle.
Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long— the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience severe visual warping. The derghodaemon's appearance becomes more and more twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous urges to inflict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horrific attack derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming infestation—the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death, provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp of the insects' bodies don't drive them to violent fury first!

Whether or not the targets are hit, each must attempt a DC 31 Reflex save (at a –2 circumstance penalty if it was actually hit by the swarm spit). [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|Persistent damage]] caused by the swarming infestation ends as soon as the creature takes any amount of damage from an area effect. The derghodaemon can't use this ability for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Success **The swarm disperses as soon as it deals its swarm spit Strike damage. 
**Success **The swarm clings to the target and infests it, dealing 1d6 persistent piercing damage. 
**Failure **The swarm clings to the target and infests it, dealing 2d6 persistent piercing damage. 
**Critical Failure **As failure, but the hissing sounds caused by the infestation also cause the target to become [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round; this additional effect has the auditory, emotion, and mental traits.</span>
