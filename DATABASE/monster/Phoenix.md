# Phoenix

The phoenix is a primordial bird made of heat and flame that dwells in the most inhospitable regions of the desert. Though highly intelligent and brimming with compassion, the phoenix is best-known for its iconic ability to resurrect itself when slain, emerging reborn from the ashes of its own corpse. Phoenixes are often sought out for their knowledge or healing abilities, as they cannot abide the sight of suffering and deny their succor only to the most foul and irredeemable of creatures.
 Phoenixes enjoy the company of metallic dragons, and when the two dwell in close proximity, they can forge lifelong friendships, sharing their resources and words of wisdom while keeping each other updated on regional news.
 While most phoenixes are benevolent, they are not infallible. When a phoenix loses its way or falls under the influence of evil, it still retains its strong appetite for knowledge. Evil phoenixes are known to assault universities and libraries in their pursuit for power—not only to gain new information, but also to set fire to the texts and thus hoard that knowledge for themselves.

Self-resurrection happens only if there are some remains to resurrect; for instance, a phoenix killed by a [[DATABASE/spell/Disintegrate|disintegrate]] spell can’t use this ability. A phoenix whose remains rest within an area devoted to an evil deity by [[DATABASE/ritual/Consecrate|consecrate]] can’t self-resurrect until its remains are no longer in that area.

###  Servants of Sarenrae

While phoenixes are not denizens of the Outer Planes, they have long been associated with the goddess Sarenrae. Indeed, many phoenixes view the Dawnflower as their patron and subscribe to her mission of redeeming those who have fallen to evil.
