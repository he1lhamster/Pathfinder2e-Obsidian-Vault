# Clockwork Amalgam

A clockwork amalgam is a powerful construct created by applying magic to a collection of interchangeable internal mechanisms. Each clockwork amalgam has unique properties, although most stand roughly 12 feet tall and have five clockwork appendages tipped with integrated weapons.
**Recall Knowledge - Construct ([[Arcana]], [[Crafting]])**: DC 45
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 43

<span class="in-box-ability">**Efficient Winding** For the clockwork amalgam to act, it must be wound by another creature using a unique key. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for 72 days, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> The amalgam can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: When it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).</span><span class="in-box-ability"> A creature can attempt a DC 31 [[Thievery]] check to [[Disable a Device]] to wind the clockwork down. For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Recalibrate <span class="action-icon">2</span> ** The clockwork amalgam can recalibrate its internal structure to shed damaged components and replace them with new ones, restoring 125 HP to the construct. Each time it uses this ability, the clockwork amalgam permanently deactivates one of its five melee attacks as the components from that arm reassemble within the core of the machine.</span>

It makes up to five melee Strikes (one for each active melee attack it has available), taking a –4 penalty to the attack roll for each attack, but ignoring the multiple attack penalty until it has made all of its attacks. It can use each melee attack only once and it can target each creature in reach only once. If the clockwork amalgam used Whirring Doom in the previous round, it can use it again this round using only 1 action instead of 3. The amalgam's movement Speed is halved until the end of its next turn.</span>

###  Fell Amalgams

Some clockwork amalgams become possessed by fell spirits or fiendish influences. Gifted with a spark of sentience, these “fell amalgams” purposely seek out other clockwork creations to destroy, collecting their parts and incorporating them into the fell amalgams' own ever-growing clockwork bodies. Unlike with typical clockworks, a fell amalgam's intricate clockwork brain can hatch cunning schemes and far-reaching plans.
