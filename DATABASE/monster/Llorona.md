# Llorona

Vengeful spirits called lloronas arise from people who died overcome with the grief and shame that comes with the tragic drowning of a child. In life, a llorona may have contributed to the child's death or simply lost the child to a horrible accident. In death, a llorona's pain manifests as a malevolent desire to drown others, imparting the same grief that they share with the person's loved ones. To this end, lloronas remain along riversides and other bodies of water in hopes of drawing their next victim and compelling them to drown themselves.
 Lloronas look much like they did in life, except they wear elegant funeral attire in undeath. Though stories typically describe lloronas as women, reports from seasoned adventurers include accounts of lloronas appearing as different genders and with a variety of appearances.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Rejuvenation** (divine, necromancy) When a llorona is destroyed, they re-form after 1d6 days at the site of their death.

Each living creature within 120 feet must attempt a DC 31 Will save. Regardless of its result, the creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
 **Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] with the nearest body of water and compelled to move toward the water and drown itself. If there's no nearby body of water, the creature instead remains still. The creature can attempt another DC 31 Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer fascinated. Once the fascinated condition ends, the creature becomes stunned 1.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature receives another Will save only at the end of a round in which it's submerged in water.</span>

###  Ghost Stories

Stories about lloronas are common in settlements near rivers, lakes, and the sea. These stories are typically aimed at children, intending to keep them from staying out late or venturing near waterways alone.
