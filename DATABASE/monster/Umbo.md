**Critical Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Success** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Helpful|helpful]] to myceloids and can't take hostile actions against them. If attacked by Umbo, the target is freed from this effect at the end of Umbo's turn. 
**Failure** As success, but for 1 minute. 
**Critical Failure** As success, but until the purple pox is cured.</span>
