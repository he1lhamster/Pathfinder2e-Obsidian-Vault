# Painted Stag

At a distance, painted stags appear constructed in the general shape of male deer, their flanks and antlers decorated with unique, colorful patterns. But while they retain (and indeed, augment) the blueprints [[DATABASE/deity/Shumunue|Shumunue]] imparted upon them, painted stags reject the confines of the Carved Lady's art of mimicry. Today, their cloven, hardwood hooves can crush bone and daub paint with equal skill, and their antlers snap together in a deadly vise. Their torsos rotate freely to navigate the latticed trees of their home plane—all the better to chase prey to their inevitable death.

###  Artistic Exchange

Though few know it, painted stags paint their own markings—making their sporadic appearances in elven art and tattoos, particularly in those cultures descended from the lost nation of Mierani in Varisia, all the more appropriate. Many modern depictions, however, erroneously portray them as benevolent protectors of the forest. Only Darklands tattoo cultures consistently depict them as the relentless predators they truly are.
