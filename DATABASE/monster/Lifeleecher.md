# Lifeleecher

Lifeleechers are mortic [[DATABASE/ancestry/Orc|orcs]] with gray flesh, sharp claws, and protruding tusks. Resilient and strong, they devour the vital essence of their enemies, which heals their wounds and shackles those souls to the lifeleecher.
 Many orcs believe lifeleechers are possessed by the spirits of fallen orc warriors too stubborn to die. Feared and revered, lifeleechers often rise to positions of power in their holds and battle on the front lines against the undead armies of the Whispering Tyrant.

###  Defying Death

Lifeleechers are commonly formed when an orc tainted by the pollutants of the Gravelands falls in battle. As their ferocity overcomes them, they transform into mortics and continue the fight, drawing sustenance from the enemies that first laid them low.
