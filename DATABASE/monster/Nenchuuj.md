# Nenchuuj

Nenchuujes embody the fear of magic corrupted, gone wrong, or spiraling out of control with unintended consequences. A nenchuuj's eyes are like divination pools, showing visions of all the ways various spells can fail, backfire, or warp. The smell of burnt flesh and ozone hangs heavy around them. When they speak, corrupted magical energy pours from their mouths. Regions recovering from tremendous magical fallout, or where many novices in magical studies gather, may draw large numbers of nenchuujes. They like to lure spellcasters close by affecting a fear of magic, often feigning piteous distress or recoiling from simple spells, only to turn more powerful effects against a spellcaster's allies and relish the horror this produces. Nenchuujes denounce the spellcasters for being at fault in harming these allies, stoking feelings of regret.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Easy to Call** The sahkil is considered 2 levels lower for the purposes of being summoned by rituals (such as [[Planar Binding]]), but is always free to attack or leave instead of negotiate unless the primary caster's check is a critical success.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Distort Magic <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (abjuration, divine) **Trigger** A creature targets the nenchuuj with a spell; **Effect** The nenchuuj warps the creature's magic, attempting an [[Arcana]] check to counteract the spell. If successful, the nenchuuj can instead redirect the spell, as [[Spell Turning]], onto the caster or onto a different target within range from the caster.</span>
