# Kizidhar Shuyookh

Kizidhar shuyookhs are the powerful rulers of the Glowing Infinity on the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]]. They view other genies, including other kizidhars, as subservient to their own greatness, manipulating them as though they were outsiders whenever it helps achieve their goals. Kizidhar shuyookh diplomats are sent as emissaries from the Plane of Wood to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Universe]], representing the metropolis of Nodollin and Grand Sultana Eshal Muazzam Rayadii of the Glowing Infinity, Lady of All that Grows and Decays.

<span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (arcane, concentrate, polymorph) The kizidhar transforms into a Small or Medium [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Wood|wood elemental]] or plant creature. This doesn't affect the kizidhar's statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Manipulative Wish** (downtime) **Frequency** three times per year; **Effect** The shuyookh conducts a _wish_ ritual for the benefit of a mortal, requiring no cost or secondary casters. The shuyookh's result is a success if they succeed at a DC 5 flat check or a failure if not. The shuyookh attempts to advance their own interests along with those of any beneficiaries from the wish.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Parting the Trees** The genie ignores difficult terrain from plants, and can share their space with larger plants, such as trees.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Sculpt Wood** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The kizidhar creates a wooden item out of their body that appears in their hand and remains attached. The item can be a one-handed simple weapon, shield, or object of light Bulk. A kizidhar can instead use this ability to transform an item it's already holding or to remove an object to free its hand. Any item created with Sculpt Wood crumbles to splinters if removed from the kizidhar's possession.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Seed of Ambition** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, emotion, mental) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The kizidhar plants a desire for greatness in the mind of a creature within 50 feet. The target must attempt a DC 30 Will save. On a failure, until the end of its next turn, the target can't [[DATABASE/action/Delay|Delay]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Ready|Ready]], or use reactions. Instead, it must use all its actions to Strike or cast the highest rank of spell available to it using spell slots or Focus Points, or take actions to facilitate doing so, such as drawing a weapon or moving toward an enemy. The target must focus its attacks either on the kizidhar or on the opponent it perceives to be the biggest threat. This effect ends if the kizidhar uses Seed of Ambition again.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Take Root** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (arcane, plant, wood) The genie thrusts their weapon into the ground. Plants sprout and grow out of the ground in a 20-foot burst centered on one corner of the kizidhar's square. All squares on the ground in that area are difficult terrain until the kizidhar uses this ability again.</span>

###  Wishcrafters

Kizidhar shuyookhs consider themselves artists of wish-crafting, planting, and nurturing the seeds of an idea and guiding its growth into the wish they ultimately bring to life. Shuyookhs take great pride in improving a wish as they conduct the _wish_ ritual, often adding their own unique signature elements to wishes, akin to a maker's mark.
