**Critical Success** Gambulami uses a mighty spin to smash the held creature against every creature within his reach. Every creature, including the grabbed creature, takes 1d10+7 bludgeoning damage. 
**Success** As critical success, but creatures take 1d10 bludgeoning damage. 
**Failure** The creature breaks free. 
**Critical Failure** The creature breaks free and Gambulami's spin causes him to fall [[Prone]].</span>
