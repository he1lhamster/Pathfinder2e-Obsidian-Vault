# Elder Thing Researcher

As one would expect from a species capable of living for thousands of years, many elder things grow more powerful than the standard specimen. Elder thing researchers are among the more frequently encountered of these incredibly rare beings, for their nature and interests often see them traveling to distant worlds to explore and lay the foundations for later conquest and colonization. Elder thing researchers often carry strange weapons or tools that merge technology with magic.

It then selects one of the following skills: [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], any [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]], [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]]. Once the skill is chosen, the elder thing researcher can attempt checks for the selected skill using its [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] modifier. This effect lasts until the elder thing researcher uses Eldritch Insight again to change its focus. If no focus is predetermined, assume an elder thing researcher has chosen to focus on Library Lore.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Hibernate** The elder thing enters a state of hibernation after focusing its thoughts for 1 minute. While hibernating, an elder thing is unconscious. The elder thing can remain in hibernation as long as it wishes—while hibernating, it doesn't need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a hibernating elder thing. Any effect that would normally rouse an unconscious creature can end an elder thing's hibernation, but the elder thing must attempt a DC 25 Will save. On a success, the elder thing awakens in 2d4 rounds; otherwise it takes 1d4 days to wake from hibernation. The elder thing can set the length of its hibernation when it enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening in this way, the elder thing does so in only 1d4 rounds, with no Will save necessary.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Unnatural Flight** The elder thing's wings allow it to fly in regions where flight is normally impossible, such as outer space. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Maneuver in Flight|Maneuver in Flight]], and on saving throws against effects that impede flight.</span>
