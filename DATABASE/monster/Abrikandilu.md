# Abrikandilu (Wrecker Demon)

Wrecker demons, also known as abrikandilus, despise beautiful things and do everything in their power to destroy both people and objects regarded as such. An abrikandilu forms from the souls mortals who were vandals, misanthropes, or defacers of artwork, particularly if their destructive actions stemmed from feelings of powerful envy.
 An abrikandilu loathes only one thing more than beauty: their own visage. The mere sight of their face—reflected in a mirror, a shield, or even a pool of water— can send a wrecker demon into a rage. Many demon slayers leverage tactic to their advantage, venturing into battle with polished steel shields and cold iron blades at the ready.

It is a strange irony that abrikandilus despise all works of artistry, yet without the objects of their jealousy they would have nothing to rage at but themselves.
