# Ioton

Periodically, stray thoughts colliding on the [[DATABASE/plane/Astral Plane|Astral Plane]] become entangled, forming a knot of rudimentary intellect. Known as iotons, these beings lack the willpower to manifest physical bodies, much less the self-awareness and vision to know what form these physical bodies might take. Instead, they manifest as ghostly, cloudlike wisps, each intermittently forming ephemeral features like alien eyes, unspeaking mouths, and shimmering symbols as iotons instinctively process their surroundings. Left alone, they might drift for ages amidst the Silver Sea.
 Gregariously parasitic, iotons sense and congregate around thinking beings, eagerly tearing off stray thoughts and using the harvested psychic energy to think clearly and form physical bodies. An ioton might understand that this process inflicts painful headaches in its victims, but it typically doesn't care. Not only do most of these ennosites become drunk on their newfound mental power and cling to their captured thoughts, but returning what they stole also robs an ioton of the mental bandwidth necessary to parse right from wrong. This sometimes causes a painful cycle where it repeatedly steals thoughts, apologetically surrenders them, and then blithely steals the thoughts anew.
 Iotons that gradually accumulate and consolidate enough mental potential form a permanent body, transforming into another type of ennosite.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Leech Thought** (healing, occult, polymorph, transmutation) While a creature is taking persistent mental damage from the ioton, the ioton takes the shape of a creature familiar to the target, such as an acquaintance, pet, or common animal, though the appearance is imperfect and grants no benefit to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] an individual.
 While transformed, the ioton loses its incorporeal trait, immunities, and resistances, but it gains an unarmed melee Strike with a +6 attack modifier that deals 1d8+2 bludgeoning damage. The ioton immediately returns to its original form once no creature is taking persistent mental damage from it.</span>

###  Immortal Observers

Sometimes an ioton is the sole witness to a crime or retains some other key intelligence, and their guileless minds make them trustworthy. However, actually extracting that information can prove nearly impossible, and even an ioton can misinterpret what it sees.
