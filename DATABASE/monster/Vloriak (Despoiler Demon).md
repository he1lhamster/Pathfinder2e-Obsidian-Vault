# Vloriak (Despoiler Demon)

Vloriaks rise from the sinful souls of those whose acts of sabotage resulted in despair and terror, and they delight in the destruction of mortal artifice. Often called despoiler demons, vloriaks were the followers of Xar-Azmak. Their numbers have dwindled over the eons since the Lord of Rust's death; those that exist now are scattered throughout the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]]. Their chitinous bodies and faceted eyes give them an insectile appearance.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Restoration Vulnerability** A vloriak suffers agonizing pain when a creature or object recovers from a debilitating effect in its proximity. The first time in a round in which a creature who is affected by a negative condition and is within sight of the demon reduces that condition's value, the demon takes 3d6 mental damage and cannot Lick Rust on its next turn.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Lick Rust** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (attack) **Requirements** The vloriak rusted a metal item with its tongue this turn; **Effect** The vloriak attempts a tongue Strike on the same target it just attacked. If it hits, it deals no damage as it licks away the rust and heals 2d6 Hit Points (or 4d6 Hit Points if the Strike was a critical hit). It can't Lick Rust on its next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rust** A vloriak's saliva causes metal to rust rapidly. If it succeeds at a tongue Strike or [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] attempt, the vloriak deals 2d6 damage (doubled on a critical hit) to a metal item the target is wearing or holding, ignoring its Hardness. If the vloriak hits an unattended metal item, the item takes this damage automatically. If a creature uses the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction with a metal shield against a tongue attack, the shield is automatically [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], but no other item is rusted on that attack.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spew Rusted Shards** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, evocation) The vloriak spews a 15-foot cone of acid and rusted metal. Creatures in the area take 3d6 acid and 3d6 piercing damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save). A creature that takes any piercing damage is exposed to [[DATABASE/disease/Tetanus|tetanus]]. The vloriak can't Spew Rusted Shards for 1d4 rounds.</span>

###  Vlorian Influence

Vloriaks hail from the otherworldly realm of Vlorus, and as such carry within themselves the potential for decay and rusting ruin. Other creatures that dwell in Vlorus— particularly fiends who rise to power there—can gain similar powers over rust as well. Fiends of any type can become infested with unique rust-themed abilities if they hail from this otherworldly realm.
