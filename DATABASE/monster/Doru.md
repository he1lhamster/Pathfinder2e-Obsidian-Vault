# Doru

These deceivers whisper fetid lies, sowing dark and dread inspiration into foolish mortal ears. Dorus serve as the spies and messengers of the divs. With silver tongues and dark motives, they often pledge themselves to vainglorious and deluded spellcasters, who they ply with wild conspiracies and rumors of deception among friends and foes alike; in the process, they push supposed masters to despotism and murderous revenge. All the while, dorus wean secrets, and weaknesses, from their marks. In the end, nearly every doru turns on their false liege, destroying the reputation and even causing the death of the person the doru pretended to serve.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Covetous of Secrets** Dorus have a weakness for secrets, hoarding them like a miser hoards gold. A creature can tempt a doru with some bit of obscure knowledge the doru doesn't know or thinks they don't know. Presenting the hint of the secret is a single action, which has the concentrate and linguistic traits, and requires a skill check using [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] (or some other appropriate skill determined by the GM) against the doru's Will DC. On a success, the doru is [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] for as long as the presenter draws out the explanation of the secret (spending 1 action each round doing so, to a maximum of 1 minute). On a critical success, the doru is fascinated for that duration plus 1 minute more as it ponders the implications of the secret. Regardless of the outcome, the doru is temporarily immune to that creature's attempts to present it with secrets for 1 day.</span>

###  Doru Secrets

Despite dorus' obsession, not all secrets capture their focus—instead, each fixates on a unique topic. Many are interested in the history of a particular mortal ancestry, while others delve into riddles, mathematical puzzles, or even local gossip.
