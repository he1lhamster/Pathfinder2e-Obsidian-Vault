description: "Kishis are duplicitous and murderous fey who dwell on the edges of Golarion's\
  \ densest jungles. At first glance, kishis appear to be attractive [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|humans]]\
  \ , usually of a local ethnicity, but their full heads of thick hair conceal a second\
  \ face: that of a snarling hyena. When a kishi lures their prey into a vulnerable\
  \ situation, their head swivels around, revealing this fearsome visage. In this\
  \ form, a kishi's powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush\
  \ a victim's bones in a matter of moments.<br/><br/> Kishi range widely in their\
  \ physical features, and their height and weight vary as much as the people whose\
  \ communities they infiltrate. They dress in fine clothing aligned with the latest\
  \ fashion trends, and they wear flashy jewelry with the intention of drawing onlookers'\
  \ eyes.<br/><br/> Like most fey, a kishi has inscrutable motives, though to their\
  \ victims, the kishi's goal seems simple\u2014to revel in the expression of shock,\
  \ betrayal, and terror on a victim's face. Although kishis can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Charm|charm]]\
  \ to make unwitting companions complacent, most of these sinister creatures prefer\
  \ to trick their prey using guile, gifts, and their dashing good looks. These ultimate\
  \ sadists derive pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward\
  \ at the end. The more uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better\u2014for\
  \ nothing satisfies kishis as much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone\
  \ who rarely grants it.<br/><br/> When kishis get their new friends or lovers alone,\
  \ they choose the most dramatic moments to reveal their true monstrous forms and\
  \ clamp their jaws down on their victim. Kishis have no desire to share their true\
  \ nature with the entire community, so they typically aim for the throats of their\
  \ victims, who can no longer cry out for help after being cut off from air. Kishis\
  \ consume every part of their victims' bodies, leaving no trace of the crime\u2014\
  even lapping up any spilled blood, claiming the victim's treasures as their own,\
  \ and cleaning the murder scene as much as possible.<br/><br/> Few things can bind\
  \ a community together as swiftly as uncovering a kishi. Once found out, a kishi\
  \ flees, hoping to find a new community to prey upon.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge\

# Kithangian (Beast Demon)

The kithangian—a horrifying amalgam of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Horse|horse]] and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Scorpion|scorpion]] also known as a “beast demon”—is a foul fiend born of the souls of mortals who abused and tormented animals in life. Kithangians tend to roam wild areas rife with animals to torture, though humanoid settlements with plenty of pets or livestock also make for tantalizing hunting grounds. Uncontested for too long, a kithangian's presence has a corrupting influence on the local fauna, which birth fiendish monstrosities until the demon is vanquished. If it realizes it's being tracked by vengeful [[DATABASE/class_/Druid|druids]] or demon slayers, a kithangian assumes the shape of an unassuming animal so it can get the jump on its pursuers.

###  Demon Hunters

Reclaimers of the Sarkoris Scar who follow the [[DATABASE/deity/Green Faith|Green Faith]] consider kithangians particularly heinous foes. They take grim satisfaction in hunting and slaying such demons, viewing their extermination as just vengeance for the evils these demons visit upon wildlife.
