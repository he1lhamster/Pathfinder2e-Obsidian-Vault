# Venexus

The white dragon Venexus hatched in Winterwall Glacier, north of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords and Irrisen, alongside her brother Fezerod. Upon reaching maturity, Venexus and Fezerod migrated south to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords in search of unclaimed territory. Although the pair remained together for centuries, shortly after they conquered Lost Mammoth Valley together Venexus drove him off. The valley was, at the time, a highly frequented migratory route rich in resources, wildlife, and humanoids to subjugate. Fezerod fled in heartbreak and shame. In the centuries since, Venexus has maintained control of Lost Mammoth Valley, considering the region and everything within her property.
 The opening of the Worldwound to the east forever changed Lost Mammoth Valley and Venexus's role as its self-appointed ruler. Invading demons forced the Burning Mammoth following to abandon most of their ancient migratory route, including Lost Mammoth Valley, leaving Venexus without intelligent creatures to subjugate. Thankfully, it wasn't long before a group of Sarkorian refugees settled in the valley. After these people, who called themselves Sutaki, established a permanent settlement, she made herself known as their overlord. To ensure their cooperation, she built her glacial palace alongside them, blocking escape from the valley.
 Years later, a brave but foolish Burning Mammoth warrior named Metuak came to Lost Mammoth Valley seeking Venexus's aid. He asked her to end the curse placed upon him by the Primordial Flame and to free him of his possession by the shadow demon Xeleria. Rather than help, Venexus stole the Primordial Flame, forcing Metuak to flee for Hillcross. Although Venexus would have followed to ensure his death, she hadn't truly understood the artifact's curse or its powers. The lamp burned her badly and melted her palace, but she couldn't bear to part with it. It became, in time, both her most valuable asset and greatest weakness.
