# Pine Pangolin

These creatures sleep while hanging upside down by their partially curled tails and rely on their thick wooden scales to protect them from danger. One such danger the scales negate is the falling damage from deliberately rolling up and dropping onto the head of an unsuspecting opponent, which is one of their favorite combat strategies. Beneath their scales, pine pangolin bodies secrete a thick, sticky tar that serves as a secondary line of defense.

###  More Wooded Origins

Pine pangolins grow in clusters of two to five individuals on giant trees, protected by a cozy layer of tar until their scales harden enough for their first drop. Snapdrakes are handcrafted for kizidhar nobility, often serving as loyal guards. Nobody knows where painted stags come from, as all who have tried to investigate have been eaten.
