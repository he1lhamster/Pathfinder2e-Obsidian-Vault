# Wraith, Smog

Clouds of choking fumes and toxic smog continuously shroud these potent undead. They constantly belch forth noxious vapors and find great humor in the death of creatures too weak to resist their vile fumes. These fetid vapors are so dense the corpses of a smog wraith's victims can float among them.
 Though it's possible to create smog wraiths through necromancy, most are the result of industrialists, inventors, and polluters who in life relished opportunities to exploit nature for profit, power, or prestige. In death, these wretched souls can rise as smog wraiths to continue their spoliation.

###  Smog Lords

In rare cases, evil druids slain by citydwelling foes rise as powerful smog wraiths called smog lords. These unholy beings wield all the usual powers of a smog wraith, as well as potent primal magic with which to wither and destroy civilization.
