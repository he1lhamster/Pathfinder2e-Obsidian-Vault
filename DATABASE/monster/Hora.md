# Hora

While most nymphs bond with a natural feature, such as a tree, pool, or cave, horai are rare nymphs associated with a specific time—the summer or winter solstice—rather than a location. Horai erect simple astronomical calendars near their home, which they use to mark the moment when the sun reaches its highest or lowest point in the sky. An hora tied to the summer solstice grows more powerful as the sun reaches its height, while an hora tied to the winter solstice is sickly and weak. The opposite holds true for winter horai, who are weak in summer and strong in winter. Meanwhile, autumn and spring horai draw power near the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, becoming weaker around the opposite equinox. 
Summer horai appear constantly bathed in sunlight, with skin and clothing of red, orange, and yellow, like the sunlight of high summer.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Solstice Dependent** An hora is mystically bonded to a natural location with a simple astronomical calendar that marks the summer and winter solstice. If they aren't at that location at dawn when the sunlight touches the calendar, they become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]], increasing the value by 1 for each missed day and reducing by 1 only when they witness dawn's light touch the calendar. Even on a cloudy day, there's enough sunlight to satisfy the hora's need. An hora can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond to a new location.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Summer's Salvation** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The summer hora or an ally within 30 feet that the summer hora can see fails a Perception check or saving throw; **Effect** If it's the month of the summer solstice, the hora's or ally's check retroactively gains a +4 status bonus, which can change the outcome from a critical failure to a failure or a failure to a success. If it's the month before or after the summer solstice, the check gains a retroactive +2 status bonus instead. In the other months except during the three winter solstice months, the check gains a retroactive +1 status bonus instead. During the winter solstice months, this ability has no effect. The summer hora can't use Summer's Fortune again for 1d4 rounds.</span>

###  Other Horai

The statistics here are for summer horai, but you can represent the other three types of horai with the following alterations. Winter horai have resistance to cold rather than to fire and Strikes that deal cold damage rather than fire damage. Similarly, autumn horai have resistance to negative energy and Strikes that deal negative damage; spring horai have no resistance and Strikes that deal positive damage (which only harms undead and creatures with [[DATABASE/monsterability/Negative Healing|negative healing]], as normal). Winter horai have the Winter Bound ability which impairs them during the summer months, and winter horai queens reverse the effects of their Tied to the Land ability (their land is healthy during the winter and withers during the summer). Similarly, autumn and spring horai are impaired during the opposing months, and their queens' Tied to the Land abilities change accordingly. Winter horai have Winter's Rescue rather than Summer's Salvation, which gives a +4 status bonus during the month of the winter solstice (Kuthona on Golarion), a +2 status bonus on the months before and after it (Neth and Abadius), a +1 bonus on most other months, and no benefit during the three summer months. Similarly, autumn and spring horai have reactions that grant a +4 status bonus during the month of their equinox, a +2 status bonus on the months just before and after, a +1 status bonus on other months, and no benefit during the opposing equinox and the months just before and after.
