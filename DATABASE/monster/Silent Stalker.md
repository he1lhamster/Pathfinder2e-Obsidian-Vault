# Silent Stalker

When a person is betrayed and killed in a way that their voice was silenced (such as through strangulation by a lover or close confidante), they might come back as a silent stalker. A silent stalker is a horrifying, twisted likeness of the person they were in life, with one obvious difference: the silent stalker has no mouth, simply a smooth patch of flesh where a mouth should be. Sound is suppressed in an area around a silent stalker, but once someone notices the quiet, it's often too late.

###  Silent Superstition

One marvels at the way people misunderstand the most basic facts about the magic of the dead. The absolute silence of certain revenants has led ignorant fools to believe they fear sound. People espousing this folly claim one can simply retreat to noisier surroundings, such as a tavern full of rowdy patrons, to keep the stalker at bay. In truth, nothing can stop a silent stalker, apart from destroying them or killing their murderer.
