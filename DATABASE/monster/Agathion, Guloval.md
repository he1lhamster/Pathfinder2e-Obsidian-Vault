# Agathion, Guloval

Agathions are born from petitioners who achieved enlightenment in life or after death and received [[DATABASE/plane/Nirvana|Nirvana's]] blessing. A guloval is small in stature but fierce, appearing as an anthropomorphic wolverine with gray and black fur, a white strip down the snout, and fearsome digging claws that can be easily used as weapons.
 A guloval's core value is aggressive protection, and as such, they are one of the most militant of the normally peaceful agathions. A guloval attacks with a frightening ferocity to protect others, and they particularly seek out roles as guardians of children or the elderly. Despite this compulsion to protect those who may not be able to defend themselves, gulovals are also known for grumpy temperaments and impatience with social niceties. Most prefer to live as hermits when they're not assisting someone in need.

Once an ally becomes a ward, a magical link forms between the guloval and the ward, and as long as they are on the same plane and both are alive, the guloval knows the ward's direction from them, distance from them, and any conditions affecting them. A guloval can maintain this link with up to 4 wards—if they select a fifth, one of the previous wards (chosen by the guloval) loses the link and is no longer a ward.</span>

###  Holoma Gulovals

A few Holoma clans maintain close relationships with gulovals who have traveled far from their home in [[DATABASE/plane/Nirvana|Nirvana]] to dwell on Golarion. These gulovals are truly ferocious when marching into battle alongside Holoma allies. All gulovals have internal codes that help guide and prevent them from harming innocents, and those allied with Holoma families are no exception.
