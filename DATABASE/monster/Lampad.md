# Lampad

Lampads protect dark, hidden places underground. Not only do they defend subterranean caverns from threats, but they also safeguard well-meaning innocents from the dangers that lurk below the surface. Lampads are so-named for the wisps of magic light they often carry, guiding the lost to safety while luring threats to their doom. Lampads' mercurial nature makes their reactions difficult to predict, though they rarely demonstrate outright malice without sufficient provocation.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Cavern Dependent** A lampad is mystically bonded to a single cavern or other self-contained underground area and must remain within 300 feet of it. If they move beyond that range, they become [[Sickened]] and are unable to recover. They must attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save every hour or increase the sickened value by 1 (to a maximum of sickened 4). After 24 hours, they become [[Drained]], with this value increasing by 1 every additional 24 hours. A lampad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond to a new cavern.</span>

###  Strong Emotions

While lampads are ever vigilant in their assigned tasks, they're known to become lonely and forlorn, as the majority of underground denizens make poor company. True companionship and conversation are among the few things that can keep a moody lampad from sporadically weeping, though like most creatures they find such tears cathartic, feeling better for a time after a good cry.
