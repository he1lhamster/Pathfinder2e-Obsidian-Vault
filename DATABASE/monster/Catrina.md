# Catrina

Not all spirits who enter the [[DATABASE/plane/Boneyard|Boneyard]] realize they have died. Catrinas meet these souls, helping to convince them of the finality of their fate to ease a spirit's passing. Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can't accept their death. They perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than out of true compassion for a mortal's grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material Plane, typically to help an extremely important mortal pass on.
 Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright flowers and colorful dresses, giving them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most catrinas present as feminine, masculine catrinas still dress in bright colors and carry garlands of flowers.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Compel Condemned** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The catrina telepathically compels a creature within 30 feet to approach and allow the catrina to kiss them, in preparation for using Kiss of Death. The target must attempt a DC 22 Will save. 
**Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Compel Condemned for 24 hours. 
**Failure** The creature must spend each of its actions to move closer to the catrina as quickly as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the compelled creature is adjacent to the catrina, it stays still and doesn't act. If the creature takes any damage, the effect ends and the creature is temporarily immune to Compel Condemned for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round, but if the catrina uses this ability again on subsequent rounds, it extend the duration by 1 round for all affected creatures. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but damage does not end the effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Kiss of Death** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (death, divine, manipulate, necromancy) The catrina gives a long, passionate kiss to an [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] or willing creature, dealing 3d6 negative damage.
