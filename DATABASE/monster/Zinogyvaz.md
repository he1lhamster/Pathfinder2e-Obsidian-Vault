**Children of the Night** (divine, enchantment, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. Zinogyvaz can only bring forth [[Hunting Spider]] and [[Spider Swarm]]. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.
**Items** _+2 [[Striking]] [[Composite Shortbow]]_ (20 arrows), [[Religious Symbol]] of [[Urgathoa]], [[Bracers of Armor]]

<span class="in-box-ability">**[[Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The vampire transforms into one of its animal forms or back into its normal form. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. Zinogyvaz can turn into a hunting spider or spider swarm only, and she keeps her fangs and web Strikes in either form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Create Spawn** (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drink Blood** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, necromancy) **Requirement** A [[Grabbed]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Restrained]], [[Unconscious]], or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. **Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [[Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[Drained]] and Zinogyvaz regains 24 Hit Points, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.
 A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 [[Medicine]] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. 
When Drinking Blood, Zinogyvaz may inject the victim with vampire drider venom.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Turn to Mist** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [[Gaseous Form]] spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses [[Fast Healing]] while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vampire Drider Venom** (poison) **Saving Throw** DC 35 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 3d8 poison damage and [[Enfeebled]] (1 round); **Stage 2** 4d8 poison damage and [[Paralyzed]] (1 round)</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Web Trap** A creature hit by Zinogyvaz's web attack is [[Immobilized]] and stuck to the nearest surface ([[Escape]] DC 35).</span>
