description: "<i>Veshumirix is capable of patience and farsighted behavior, but he\
  \ is also prone to outbursts of cruelty and destruction. His ego is surprisingly\
  \ fragile for a dragon of his strength, and he has no tolerance for the failures\
  \ of his underlings.</i> Veshumirix hatched in 3965 AR, one of a clutch of seven\
  \ dragons tucked away in a magma chamber beneath the tallest pair of mountains in\
  \ the Five King's Mountains: Torag's Crag. As typical among the fiercely independent\
  \ magma dragons, Veshumirix and his siblings were left to fend for themselves.<br/><br/>\
  \ Conflict between Veshumirix and his siblings began almost immediately. Veshumirix\
  \ was the second to hatch, shortly after his brother Moschabbatt, and proved the\
  \ weaker of the two. Eventually, on the verge of death from his wounds, Veshumirix\
  \ was forced to admit defeat, retreat, and plot revenge.<br/><br/> But Veshumirix's\
  \ plots were not to be fulfilled. He did not realize that far greater forces were\
  \ at work in the volcano, paying no mind to the petty squabble of wyrmlings. When\
  \ the gold dragon Mengkare inadvertently triggered the Rending, the massive volcanic\
  \ eruption utterly destroyed Veshumirix's modest lair and swept the young dragon\
  \ toward the volcano's core. Veshumirix let the current carry him in hopes of studying\
  \ the source of the devastation, hoping he might one day learn to harness such power\
  \ for himself and unleash it. He expected to see a mighty great wyrm magma dragon\
  \ rising from the ruin, but instead, he arrived just in time to see Mengkare abandoning\
  \ the site. Confused, he combed the area, looking for anyone who could explain what\
  \ had happened. As he searched, he came across a beautiful, shiny fragment for his\
  \ hoard: one of the shards of the destroyed <i> [[DATABASE/equipment/Orb of Dragonkind|Orb\
  \ of Gold Dragonkind]] </i>. The reports he gathered in bits and pieces from other\
  \ creatures of the volcano were imperfect records, embellished in the stories of\
  \ the few witnesses who had escaped the epicenter. While these tales revealed to\
  \ Veshumirix that his magma dragon theory had been incorrect, they also gave him\
  \ the false impression that the gold dragon Mengkare had mastered a means of triggering\
  \ titanic eruptions.<br/><br/> At first, Veshumirix was furious that a gold dragon\
  \ had discovered such power and was being spoken of in reverent tones as a greater\
  \ master of the volcanoes than the mightiest of magma dragons. Veshumirix swore\
  \ to himself that he would one day surpass Mengkare. In his childish but malevolent\
  \ fancies, he imagined himself tearing Mengkare limb from limb before triggering\
  \ an even larger eruption, one large enough to blanket the whole world in magma\
  \ and ash. Before slaying Mengkare, though, Veshumirix was first determined to bring\
  \ ruin to his brother Moschabbatt.<br/><br/> When Veshumirix returned to his birthplace\u2014\

  \ defeat. Veshumirix could have easily died that day, but Moschabatt was so overconfident\

# Veshumirix

_Veshumirix is capable of patience and farsighted behavior, but he is also prone to outbursts of cruelty and destruction. His ego is surprisingly fragile for a dragon of his strength, and he has no tolerance for the failures of his underlings._ Veshumirix hatched in 3965 AR, one of a clutch of seven dragons tucked away in a magma chamber beneath the tallest pair of mountains in the Five King's Mountains: Torag's Crag. As typical among the fiercely independent magma dragons, Veshumirix and his siblings were left to fend for themselves.
 Conflict between Veshumirix and his siblings began almost immediately. Veshumirix was the second to hatch, shortly after his brother Moschabbatt, and proved the weaker of the two. Eventually, on the verge of death from his wounds, Veshumirix was forced to admit defeat, retreat, and plot revenge.
 But Veshumirix's plots were not to be fulfilled. He did not realize that far greater forces were at work in the volcano, paying no mind to the petty squabble of wyrmlings. When the gold dragon Mengkare inadvertently triggered the Rending, the massive volcanic eruption utterly destroyed Veshumirix's modest lair and swept the young dragon toward the volcano's core. Veshumirix let the current carry him in hopes of studying the source of the devastation, hoping he might one day learn to harness such power for himself and unleash it. He expected to see a mighty great wyrm magma dragon rising from the ruin, but instead, he arrived just in time to see Mengkare abandoning the site.

## Campaign Use

If Veshumirix survives the adventure, he is likely to seek revenge against the PCs in the future. Beyond that, he is a ready ally for the Scarlet Triad in future adventures. He wants to aid the organization in the short term, but he is secretly planning a betrayal to steal the destructive power they are building so he can wield it against Moschabbatt.
