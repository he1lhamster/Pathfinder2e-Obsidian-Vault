# Giant Hermit Crab

Lucky hermit crabs with plentiful resources can live for decades and grow to tremendous sizes, often with magical help. Too large for most natural shells, giant hermit crabs use a variety of debris instead, including wagons, boats, treasure chests, and even abandoned pieces of giant armor.
