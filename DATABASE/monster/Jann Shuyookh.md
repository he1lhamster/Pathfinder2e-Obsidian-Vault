# Jann Shuyookh

Regarded as the progenitors of geniekind, janns hold a position of esteem above the genies tied to specific planes. They possess an inborn ability to grant wishes, which the other branches of geniekind lack and greatly envy. Nomadic jann shuyookhs rarely hold court, preferring to gather only when the need arises to perform great deeds. Lesser janns respect and venerate these leaders for their wisdom and total dedication to preserving the honor and reputation of their people. A jann shuyookh reads portents and omens when dealing with duplicitous mortals.

A summoned jann can't use this ability.</span>

###  Evolving Essence

With the return of the metal and wood elemental planes, janns found new elemental magic surging within their beings. This has caused rapid physical changes, and janns anticipate that it could eventually even change their moods and thoughts. Though most janns now feel the full breadth of elemental power, some still find themselves limited to just the elements of air, earth, fire, and water, or have diminished influence over metal and wood compared to the other four elements.
