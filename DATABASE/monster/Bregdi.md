# Bregdi

Bregdis hunt warm-blooded prey, lurking in the waters of most major port cities before using their ray-like bodies and hooked claws to hitch onto the underside of boats pulling into port. From beneath the docks and in the channels of settlements, bregdis wait for the careless or unlucky to fall into the water, where they make quick work of their hapless victims.
Although bregdis have little more intelligence than most animals, a particularly opportunistic bregdi might realize that a fishing line often leads to a tasty meal. A bregdi that spots a fishing lure might grab it gently with its claw to imitate a fish caught on the line. Once a fisherman is “hooked” and starts to reel in, the bregdi plays along, slowly approaching the shore while making sluggish struggling motions. Once near land, the bregdi violently tugs on the lure to yank its unsuspecting prey into the water. Bregdis can survive out of water for short periods of time, but only the most desperate bregdis hunt on land.
