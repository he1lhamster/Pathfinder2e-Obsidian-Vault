# Alate Ant

Alate ants are no less devoted and powerful than red guard ants, but they are slightly smaller in size and have delicate wings that bear them aloft. Alate ants secrete pheromones that addle the minds of the hive's enemies. A hive deploys alate ants as both defenders from aerial threats and as advance scouts.
