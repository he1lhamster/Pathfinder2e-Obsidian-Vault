# Piranha Swarm

More teeth and fury than body, few fish command as much fear and anxiety as the piranha. They move almost exclusively in schools, overwhelming larger creatures with sheer numbers and ferocity. Piranhas aggress toward sudden disturbances in the water and can smell blood from far away. Harvested piranha teeth serve as excellent cutting tools.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Feeding Frenzy** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Each enemy in the swarm's space takes 2d6 piercing damage (DC 20 basic Reflex save). A creature that fails the save also takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to their Reflex saves against Feeding Frenzy while this damage continues, as the piranhas' frenzy increases in intensity when they smell blood.</span>
