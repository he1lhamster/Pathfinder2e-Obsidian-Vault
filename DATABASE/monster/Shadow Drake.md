# Shadow Drake

Shadow drakes are typically among the smallest and least powerful of their species. Most stand as tall and long as house cats and have charcoal-colored scales and membranous wings just translucent enough to pass for shadows. Attracted to shiny materials, they employ deception, teamwork, and even rudimentary traps to create opportunities to make off with ill-gotten gains. Shadow drakes have a particular fascination and admiration for umbral dragons—a notable exception to the norm for drakes and dragons.

**Shadow Blend** The shadow drake's form shifts and blends reflexively with surrounding shadows. A shadow drake gains an additional reaction each round, but it can use this reaction only for Shadow Evade.
**Shadow Evade <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger **A creature attacks the shadow drake while it is in an area of dim light; **Effect **The shadow drake further obscures its position. The attacker must succeed at a DC 11 flat check in order to affect the shadow drake, as if the drake were [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|Hidden]] for the triggering attack.
