# Pixie

Insatiably curious, overly excitable, and just a bit puckish, pixies are wanderers and tricksters who use their pixie dust to create all sorts of whimsical situations, as well as to defend themselves. Other creatures often have trouble understanding a pixie’s rapid, rambling way of speaking.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Sprinkle Pixie Dust** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate) The pixie sprinkles pixie dust onto one of its arrows. If the pixie hits a creature with that arrow before the pixie’s next turn, the arrow inflicts one of the following special effects instead of dealing damage. Each effect depends on the target’s DC 21 Will save. On a critical hit, the target treats its save result as one degree worse.

* **Charm** (emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The target suffers the effects of a _charm_ spell, except it doesn’t gain a bonus to its save if the only hostile act was the pixie firing its bow, and the pixie can choose to direct the target’s adoration toward another creature rather than itself.
* **Memory Loss** (divination, mental) On a failed Will save, the target loses the last 5 minutes of its memory.
* **Sleep** (enchantment, incapacitation, mental, sleep) The target suffers the effects of a 3rd-level _sleep_ spell.
* **Subdual** (enchantment, mental, nonlethal) The target takes 4d6 mental damage, depending on its basic Will save.

###  Variant Pixie Arrows

Pixies can enchant their arrows with a wide variety of effects, though nearly all such enchantments are designed to charm or bewilder, never maim. Some arrows may emulate the effects of spells such as confusion, fear, hideous laughter, and even suggestion.
