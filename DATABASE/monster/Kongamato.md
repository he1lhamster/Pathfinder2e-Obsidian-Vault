# Kongamato

Though they resemble pterosaurs and hail from a similar era, kongamatos are actually a primeval branch of dragonkind. They aren't particularly intelligent and lack the powerful magical abilities that many of their dragon kindred command, but a kongamato has a supernaturally strong beak that can punch through incredibly dense substances. While this beak might seem like a valuable trophy for hunters, its magic dies with the kongamato, and all attempts to integrate them into weapons have failed.
 Though they dwell in swamps and other still waters, kongamatos prefer to hunt in rivers and streams, since running water delivers new prey on a regular basis. The predators hunt everything, and they are well aware their powerful beaks can sink boats and rafts. They even possess a semblance of draconic greed. While they care little for the material wealth or societal power, kongamatos claim large hunting territories, violently attacking any would-be rivals and ravenously slaughtering large animals in their territory, leaving carcasses half-eaten with little regard for whether they'll still have meals in the future.
 When a kongamato claims a territory that encapsulates a community, the people there have no choice but to hunt down the vicious predator or hire adventurers to do so on their behalf. Kongamatos' hunger is such that a single one can devastate entire herds of livestock and threaten the safety of the entire community. Unlike their draconic relatives, kongamatos ignore attempts to bargain with them, and efforts to appease them through regular sacrifices have no effect.

###  The Mother Kongamato

Legend tells of a massive elder kongamato who dwells in the southern Mwangi Jungle. Many refer to this centuries-old creature as the mother of kongamatos. Rather than prowling waterways, this one prefers solitude inland among the dense foliage of the jungle. Inhabitants of the area believe the high-pitched thunder that comes under a clear sky to be the creature's magical voice.
