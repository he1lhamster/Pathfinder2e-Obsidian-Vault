# Bogeyman

These nocturnal stalkers tail their chosen quarry for days, even weeks at a time, ominously showing up in back alleys, shadowy street corners, and even in victims’ own homes before going in for the kill. For unfathomable reasons, a bogeyman may spare a victim’s life and instead kidnap them, absconding to a far-off location before returning years later with a fresh bogey in tow.

A bogeyman’s aura of terror manifests as a shifting haze of images that reflect the viewers’ deepest fears. Whenever a creature ends its turn within the aura, it must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or become [[Frightened]]. A creature’s frightened condition (including from striking fear) does not reduce as long as the creature remains in the aura. If the creature succeeds at its saving throw, it becomes temporarily immune to the aura for 24 hours.</span>
