# The Bloodstorm

A hundred thousand leeches, mosquitos, and parasites form a roiling mass of hunger and malice. It moves like a storm through the tunnels and caverns of the Emperor's Peak, constantly in search of its next meal. Though it has many bodies, it has just one, startlingly clever mind. The flames and smoke of the cities keeps it at bay, but in the darkness, it is at home. The [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarves]] of Highhelm have learned how to live with the threat, but those traveling deeper into the mountain must always remain vigilant.
 In the swamps of the Tanglebriar, food is difficult to come by. So when a grievously wounded demon, a [[DATABASE/monster/Shemhazian (Mutilation Demon)|shemhazian]] known as Gratheyr, fled into its waters to escape from his enemies, every starving creature swarmed at the smell of blood. As the creatures devoured his flesh, they were corrupted by his [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyssal]] blood, and their hunger only grew. They feasted until nothing but his heart remained, still beating at the center of the swarm, binding it to a single will. With its meal finished, the bloated swarm left the swamp in search of its next prey. It moved aimlessly, hunting animals and travelers alike, until a great rumble beneath the earth attracted its attention. The Bloodstorm followed the vibrations deep underground, toward the scent of sweat and the sounds of voices.

###  Sadistic Hunter

While the Bloodstorm is mostly driven by animal instincts, it still has traces of the shemhazian's obsession with torment and pain. It's been known to leave victims wounded but alive, allowing them to narrowly escape. The swarm then follows the trail of blood, remaining hidden until the victim find's someone who can offer aid. Once the rescuer has treated the victim's injuries and they feel safe, it fills the tunnel with the sound of buzzing and floods in to strike. While [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarves]] from urban centers may consider these old wives' tales, those further from the city know well the dangers of an open wound.
