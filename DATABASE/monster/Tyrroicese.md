**Speed** 15 feet
<span class="in-box-ability">**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> pseudopod +23 [+18/+13] (acid, magical, reach 15 feet, versatile P), **Damage** 2d10+13 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Pseudopod Burst** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Tyrroicese makes up to three pseudopod strikes, each against a different creature. Tyrroicese's multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after all these attacks are made.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rallying Call** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (occult) When Tyrroicese subsumed Corporal Quordein, it gained a perverted form of the commander's ability to rally allies. The first time Tyrroicese uses this ability, it summons an [[DATABASE/monster/Ochre Jelly|ochre jelly]], which leaks out of the ceiling of area D13 and drops to the floor to join the fight, siding with Tyrroicese. Thereafter, when Tyrroicese uses this ability, any oozes within 60 feet become [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] for 1 round (the oozes can use their extra action only to Stride) and, if they're not allied with the agents, the oozes ally themselves with Tyrroicese.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Stretching Step** <span class="action-icon">4</span> (move) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** Tyrroicese forcefully extends a sticky pseudopod, plants it on a wall within 45 feet, and retracts the muscle. Tyrroicese springs over to a space adjacent to the wall, moving through the intervening squares as normal but ignoring any difficult or greater difficult terrain.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Subsume** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (incapacitation) Tyrroicese lifts an adjacent [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]] creature with its pseudopods and subsumes that creature into its own oozy flesh. The subsumed creature's dying value does not increase, though it can't decrease either. Tyrroicese regains 30 HP and also gains the ability to use one or two of the subsumed creature's special abilities or feats, subject to the GM's discretion. A creature adjacent to Tyrroicese can extract a subsumed creature by spending 2 actions to attempt a DC 29 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check. On a success, the subsumed creature is pulled from Tyrroicese and falls into the nearest available space.</span>
