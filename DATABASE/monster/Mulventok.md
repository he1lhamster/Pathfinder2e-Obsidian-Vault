# Mulventok

Sinister fleshwarpers reshape captive [[Urdefhan]] into these juggernauts of war. Their clear skin is hardened into a thick, mirror-like carapace, creating an intimidating exoskeleton. Mulventoks don't live long; within weeks—or, at most, months—their hyperdeveloped muscles split open their toughened skin, and they erupt in a shower of gore. A mulventok's creator shapes its mind just as much as its body, directing its aggression toward a single purpose, such as to raze a fortress or murder a specific individual.

###  Mulventok Leaders

Some fleshwarpers forge small units of mulventoks to pursue a similar but important goal, thinking that if some of the creatures don't survive, the others can complete the objective. Mulventoks work together surprisingly well, creating hierarchies of command that shift as needed in the field. Although mulventoks are arguably just as effective when working with non-mulventoks, their singular focus—which even extends to what they eat and where and how they sleep—is off-putting at best.
