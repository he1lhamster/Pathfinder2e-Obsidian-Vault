description: 'Because [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Morlock|morlocks]] are descended from
  distant human ancestors, clumsily or hastily fleshwarping a morlock simply produces
  a [[DATABASE/monster/Grothlut|grothlut]] . Skilled fleshwarpers, however, can tease
  out a morlock''s genetic differences to make an entirely different creature. Creating
  a dreshkan involves replacing the morlock''s bones with a metal skeleton. This new
  skeleton is often heavily augmented, such as with spiderlike limbs protruding from
  the spine or magazines of tiny, deadly needles. Arcane electricity courses through
  the dreshkan thereafter, making it jumpy and irritable.<br/><br/> Morlocks view
  dreshkans as impressive fusions of flesh and technology and gladly fight alongside
  these creatures, whom they view as paragons of morlock potential.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall

# Dretch (Sloth Demon)

Among the lowest and least powerful of all demons, dretches are just as vicious and cruel as their more powerful brethren. They happily vent their frustrations on anything weaker than themselves.
 Born from the souls of the slothful, these demons appear vaguely humanoid in appearance with awkward limbs and slack lumps of skin hanging from their frames. Supposedly, a single slothful soul of sufficient depravity and strength can spawn an entire horde of these creatures. However, as weaker demons, their lot in life is to suffer at the hands of more powerful Abyssal predators, and only a tiny number of dretches ever manage to become something more. For this reason, dretches are quite accommodating when summoned by mortals. They're usually content to work under conditions few other outsiders would accept, although they'll still gladly turn on even the kindest of masters who show even the slightest hint of weakness.
