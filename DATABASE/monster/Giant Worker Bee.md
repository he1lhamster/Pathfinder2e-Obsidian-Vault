# Giant Worker Bee

Worker bees, exclusively female, exist to feed and defend a hive. They have no qualms about sacrificing their lives when confronting intruders in their territory. Worker bees can fight singly, in small groups, or in swarms of dozens. Giant worker bees inject a venom with their stings, but this venom is rarely dangerous except to people sensitive to it. Other worker bees have no stinger and only bite their enemies.
