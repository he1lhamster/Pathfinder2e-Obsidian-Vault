# Seething Spirit

Hatred so powerful it lives beyond the grave—this sentiment animates the ephemeral crimson apparitions known as seething spirits. Single-minded in nature, they stoke the fires of anger and hate, capable of planning and strategy, but the one thing beyond their grasp is personal growth. Though similar to [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghost|ghosts]], seething spirits retain much less of their former living selves. Most of their soul has moved on, and only the fury remains. There's no way to set a seething spirit to rest: only violence can destroy it.
 By possessing a creature and nurturing the seeds of resentment and rage already within its mind, a seething spirit can greatly alter the host's behavior and personality. When broached about such changes, a host might claim they're just finally “telling it like it is.” Because a seething spirit can't voluntarily end its possession, it's essentially one with its victim until the victim's rage results in death. A seething spirit doesn't take pleasure in this death—they rapidly move on in search of a new rageful host.

This aura emanates from any creature possessed by the seething spirit, and it's inactive while the spirit isn't possessing anyone. Any creature in the aura, including a creature possessed by the spirit, takes a –1 status penalty to AC, can't perform actions with the concentrate trait except for the [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] action and actions with the rage trait, and gains a +2 status bonus to melee damage rolls against the spirit's enemies.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> A creature can attempt a DC 30 Will save when it enters the aura to avoid the effect.

If creature possessed by a seething spirit fails a saving throw against _calm emotions_, the spirit is forced out. If the spirit isn't possessing a creature and is targeted with _calm emotions_, the spirit takes 12 mental damage per level of the spell instead of the normal spell effects.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Furious Possession** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The seething spirit attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as a [[DATABASE/spell/Possession|possession]] spell (DC 30), except since the spirit doesn't have a physical body, they're not [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] when the effect ends. The spirit can't Dismiss the possession.
 The creature gains 12 temporary Hit Points that are lost when the possession ends. During the possession, the creature has the pulse of rage aura. Each time the possessed creature makes a melee Strike, the spirit can substitute their ephemeral claw attack modifier, damage amount, or both in place of the creature's own statistics.</span>

###  Directed Ire

A seething spirit most dearly wants to find a host with a rage similar to their own. A spirit spawned from romantic resentment might gravitate toward a jilted lover, for example. The rage in the seething spirit is purely evil, so a spirit created from anger at persecution might seek out an innocent prisoner to turn into a murderer who'll sate the spirit's rage.
