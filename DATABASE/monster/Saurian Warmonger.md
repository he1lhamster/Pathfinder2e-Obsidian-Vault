<span class="in-box-ability">**Boneshaking Roar** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (incapacitation, sonic) The saurian warmonger bellows, evoking the power of the primordial world. Non-dinosaur creatures within 30 feet take 10d6 sonic damage (DC 34 basic Fortitude save). On a failed save, a creature is also [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 2]] for 1 round (stunned 1d4 on a critical failure). The saurian can't use Boneshaking Roar again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Primordial Balance** A warmonger wields their mancatcher in one hand.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Restrain** When the warmonger makes a successful mancatcher Strike, their target must succeed at a DC 34 Reflex save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] until the end of the warmonger's next turn. Each time the creature fails an attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] the warmonger, it takes 2d6 piercing damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Three-Limbed Lunge** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The saurian warmonger makes three Strikes: one Strike each with the weapons in their hands and one Strike with their tail. They can perform these attacks in any order, though each counts toward their multiple attack penalty as normal. After making a Three-Limbed Lunge, the warmonger is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the beginning of their next turn.</span>
