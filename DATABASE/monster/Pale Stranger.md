# Pale Stranger

A pale stranger arises when a gunslinger is slain in a duel by an underhanded foe. Buried with their pistols, the corpse claws out of the grave to wreak vengeance upon their killer for cheating. Sometimes a pale stranger is created when a particularly petty [[DATABASE/class_/Gunslinger|gunslinger]] is beaten fairly and refuses to accept defeat, though such an individual must be especially self-delusional to retain the hatred necessary to spur the transformation. Whatever the circumstance, a pale stranger can wield their firearms with deadly grace and efficacy.

The pale stranger makes two ranged Strikes, one with each of the firearms, each using the pale stranger's current multiple attack penalty. Both Strikes must have the same target, who must be within the first range increment of both weapons.
 If both attacks hit, combine their damage, and then add any other applicable effects from both weapons. The pale stranger adds any precision damage only once, to the attack of their choice. Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances and weaknesses only once. This counts as two attacks when calculating the pale stranger's multiple attack penalty.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Revenant Reload** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (conjuration, occult) The pale stranger reloads each firearm they're wielding, supernaturally generating new black powder and bullets.

###  Ghastly Guns

The pistols carried by a pale stranger are valuable, but many believe they contain fragments of the creature's soul, making them cursed to slowly corrupt their wielder with the pale stranger's personality. As such, it can be difficult to sell a pale stranger's pistols. Luckily, most underworld markets trade in such goods regardless of their origin.
