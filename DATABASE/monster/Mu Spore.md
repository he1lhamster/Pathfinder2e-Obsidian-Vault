# Mu Spore

A mu spore is a thankfully rare fungoid monstrosity of vast power and strange intellect. Even the smallest mu spores are never less than a hundred feet long from tentacle tip to tentacle tip, yet despite this vast bulk, they are capable of flying with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide their flight.
 Many societies tell tales of vast mu spores appearing over cities at the dawn of apocalyptic events, but they’re more than just ravenous eaters of nations. Mu spores often possess rare or esoteric knowledge, and if peaceful contact can be made, this lore can be quite valuable. Their spores can also be used to craft certain foul drugs or deadly alchemical poisons, but harvesting these ingredients is dangerous, as the spores are not viable for long once they’ve been shed, forcing alchemists seeking to harvest them to operate in perilously close proximity to the abominations.

###  Underground Moons

Mu spores dwell in vast caverns, their pallid underbellies glowing softly to give the eerie impression of a strangely shaped “moon” adrift near the darkened ceiling so far above. Caverns can be faintly lit by this illumination—an unnerving sight for any traveler not expecting light in such a lightless realm.
