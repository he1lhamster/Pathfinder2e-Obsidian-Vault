# Shantak

The imposing shantaks are far more intelligent than their bestial appearance would suggest. They can speak, though their voices sound like glass grinding on stone, and they can't converse in any language besides [[DATABASE/language/Aklo|Aklo]].
 Shantaks' ability to travel through the gulfs of outer space at supernatural speed allows them to nest on numerous worlds, yet despite this mobility, most shantaks are reluctant to seek out new homes unless faced with no other option. Instead, they roost in discarded ruins or asteroids adrift in space, only emerging and landing upon planets in their chosen stellar system when the urge to feed compels them.
 Despite not being native to the [[DATABASE/plane/Dreamlands|Dimension of Dreams]], they're commonly found in that realm. Their ability to fly through space affords them swift travel between Leng and more hospitable reaches of the Dreamlands, making them particularly sought after as mounts for those who have business in the far reaches of the dreaming plane.
 Convincing a shantak to become a mount is notoriously difficult. They refuse any sort of training, and even if one is convinced to ferry a humanoid on their back, they can be obstinate and fickle. Anyone relying on a shantak mount should have a backup plan ready in case the shantak strands their passenger on an asteroid or strange planet after some disagreement.
 Although a shantak is nearly the size of an elephant, many possess irrational fears of certain creatures. In particular, [[DATABASE/monster/Nightgaunt|nightgaunts]] terrify them, but other shantaks have been observed fleeing from [[DATABASE/monster/Harpy|harpies]] and [[DATABASE/monster/Gargoyle|gargoyles]]. Though these ancestries all share the same trait, shantaks don't fear every type of winged humanoid, which makes the origin of their phobia all the more mysterious. Shantaks on Golarion typically hide themselves away in remote places since several of the creatures they fear appear on the planet in abundance.

###  Riding Shantaks

Those who seek to travel to other worlds might consider using a shantak as a mount for their speed and Share Defense ability, yet riding them is a risky endeavor. Far more intelligent than animals, shantak have strong, mercurial personalities and often require bribes from their riders. Even when they receive a gift they particularly enjoy, a shantak could still decide to drop off their passenger at an amusing (to them) remote location.
