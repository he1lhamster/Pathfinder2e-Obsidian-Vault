A creature that begins its turn within the area feels as if its lungs were filling with water and must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be unable to speak or breathe.

A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to breath of the bog for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rejuvenation** (divine, necromancy) Unless the damage that destroys a bog mummy cultist is positive damage, necromantic energies rebuild its body from swamp muck 1 week later. If the uncompleted body is destroyed during that time, the process starts anew. Anyone who succeeds at a DC 26 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] realizes that a [[DATABASE/ritual/Consecrate|consecrate]] ritual performed on the site that a bog mummy cultist was destroyed prevents its rejuvenation, the way positive damage prevents the rejuvenation from occurring.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rise Up <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** A creature walks on top of a bog mummy cultist that lies buried in the mud or peat below; **Requirements** Initiative has not yet been rolled; **Effect** The bog mummy automatically notices the creature and [[DATABASE/action/Burrow|Burrows]] before rolling initiative.</span>
