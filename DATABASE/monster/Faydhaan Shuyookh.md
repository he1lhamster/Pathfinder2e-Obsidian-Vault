The shuyookh can suppress or resume the aura as a free action. If the shuyookh acts hostile, the aura deactivates and can't be reactivated for 1 hour. When any other creature in the aura acts hostile, it must attempt a DC 35 Will save.

###  Shazathared

Shazathared is one of geniekind's greatest storytellers, and her noble lineage traces back to long-deposed faydhaan padishahs. Recently freed from a long imprisonment, “the Jewel of the Padishah” can be found enjoying a warm welcome among faydhaans. When the muse strikes, she performs exciting moral tales from the _Songs of Shazathared_ to honor or enlighten her hosts and delight her audience.
