###  Crawling Cargo

Undead make for the most common passengers inside a beetle carapace's abdomen, but swarms often pack tight inside the creatures. Insects tend to be more comfortable around undead than other types of animals. The following creatures make good options for combat encounters, in which they can be released at a dramatic moment for a grotesque surprise.
 **Bestiary**: [[Centipede Swarm]], [[Scorpion Swarm]], [[Wasp Swarm]]
 **Bestiary 2**: [[Army Ant Swarm]], [[Fen Mosquito Swarm]], [[Sportlebore Swarm]]
 **Bestiary 3**: [[Bore Worm Swarm]], [[Clacking Skull Swarm]], [[Hellwasp Swarm]], [[Hermit Crab Swarm]]
