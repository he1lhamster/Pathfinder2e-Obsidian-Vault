# Bison, Long-Horned

Much like their smaller [[DATABASE/monster/Bison|bison]] cousins, long-horned bison are bovines with short faces, two horns, a shaggy coat, and a noticeable hump on their back. Despite their relation to more placid bovines, however, long-horned bison are ill-tempered and territorial. Their tread shakes the ground, while the thunder of their stampedes can be mistaken for an earthquake. Long-horned bison weigh upwards of 4,500 pounds and measure up to 9 feet tall and 16 feet long. Their horns, measured tip to tip, can be almost as wide as the bison are tall.

The stampeding bison Strides up to twice its Speed in a straight line, dealing 4d8+8 bludgeoning damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save) to any Large or smaller creature in its path. 
Multiple bison can participate in Rolling Thunder by spending this ability's actions and waiting to charge until the herd is ready. Before the beginning of its next turn, a bison can then charge as a reaction triggered by an adjacent bison beginning its Rolling Thunder charge. All bison in the combined charge must charge in parallel lines, so the areas can't overlap. The combined charge deals an additional 3d8 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area, and a creature that fails the Reflex saving throw is also knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].</span>

###  Religious Significance

Long-horned bison play a prominent role in the rituals and ceremonies of many Kellid followings. Bison horns mark the shelters of community leaders, hides and wool are used to create ceremonial dress, and meat is offered to spirits before undertaking dangerous hunts. Among some followings, approaching a long-horned bison is an important coming-of-age ritual, with youths who get closest to the irascible creatures gaining more bragging rights and respect. The rare children who manage to mount a long-horned bison during these ceremonies often become community leaders, respected hunters, or legendary heroes.
