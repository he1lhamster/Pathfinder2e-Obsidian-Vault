Any creature that hears the howl must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or be frightened 1. Any creature that critically fails and is within 120 feet of the wendigo is instead frightened 3, and is also fleeing for 1d4 rounds (or until it’s no longer frightened, whichever comes first). A creature frightened by a wendigo’s howl still naturally recovers from its fright but can’t reduce it below frightened 1 in this way until 1 hour has passed or magic is used. Whether it succeeds or fails its save, a creature is then temporarily immune to that wendigo’s Howl for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ride the Wind** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (air, concentrate, primal, transmutation) **Trigger** The wendigo casts _wind walk_ while it has Grabbed a foe. **Effect** The wendigo attempts to turn the grabbed creature into wind and carry it along as part of the action. If the target succeeds at a DC 38 Will save, it prevents itself from being transformed; in this case, the wendigo still transforms, automatically releasing the victim. A creature forced to Ride the Wind along with the wendigo is exposed to wendigo torment. The target can attempt a new Will save each round to return to normal, though it immediately becomes corporeal and begins falling if it succeeds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wendigo Torment** (curse, enchantment, mental, primal) A creature affected by wendigo torment can’t recover beyond stage 1 until it has been restored to full HP. **Saving Throw** Will DC 38; **Stage 1** Stupefied 4 (1 day); **Stage 2** As stage 1 (1 day); **Stage 3** The creature searches for an individual of its own ancestry to kill and devour. It then becomes affected by _wind walk_ and sprints into the sky so fast that its feet burn away into jagged stumps. As the creature wind walks into the sky, it is replaced by a new wendigo over 2d6 minutes. Wish, similar magic, or a 9th-level resurrect ritual can return the victim to life. The new wendigo remains even if the victim is resurrected.</span>

###  Wendigo Worship

Some humanoids who dwell in arctic regions offer tribute to wendigos that hunt near their villages, treating them as gods or spirits of nature that must be appeased. They occasionally perform rites of cannibalism and place fetishes throughout the wilderness to mark the wendigo’s domain.
