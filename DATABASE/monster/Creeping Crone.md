# Creeping Crone

Hags are neither immortal nor unageing; if not slain by an enemy, a hag eventually succumbs to old age. A hag who dies in agony or rage can rise again as a [[Witchfire]], while those who die of old age might rise again as an undead creature known as a creeping crone. A creeping crone has lost far more than her life; they can't form or join covens, denying them one of a living hag's most distinguishing abilities. This inability, more than their rotting bodies or hunger for flesh, makes creeping crones exiled among their former kin.

###  Night Hags

For some reason, [[Night Hag]] never become creeping crones after they die. Although this is probably due to the protection provided by their heartstones, it might also be a side effect of long years of soul-trading in the foulest pits of the evil planes. Some stain lingers on night hags, whisking away their souls upon death so they're unable to rise as undead. Perhaps night hags can't resist making a bargain with their own souls and, upon their deaths, this payment becomes due.
