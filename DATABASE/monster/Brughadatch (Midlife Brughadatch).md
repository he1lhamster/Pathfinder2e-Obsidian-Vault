# Brughadatch (Midlife Brughadatch)

The biggest difference between a gahlepod and a grown brughadatch isn’t their humanoid appearance, but the powerful magic they gain as they mature.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Deceitful Feast** (illusion) The brughadatch conjures a decadent, enticing feast void of nutritional substance. This conjuration takes 1 minute and lasts for 24 hours. For each item of illusory food a creature eats, it must attempt a DC 29 Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature sees through the illusion and becomes immune to the effects of Deceitful Feast for 24 hours.
**Success** The creature doesn’t see through the illusion but is unaffected by the food.
**Failure** The creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Will saves against any of the brughadatch’s spells or abilities. The penalty increases with each failed save, to a maximum of –5.
**Critical Failure** As failure, plus for 1 hour, the creature’s attitude becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Helpful|helpful]] to the brughadatch, and the creature can’t use hostile actions against them.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Psychic Sip** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** Targets must have critically failed a save against a brughadatch’s Deceitful Feast or [[DATABASE/spell/Charm|charm]] innate spell; **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The brughadatch feasts on the souls of the creatures they’ve tricked. They target up to five creatures within 30 feet and feast on their ambient brainpower, dealing 4d10 mental damage (DC 26 basic Will save) to each creature. Unless a target succeeds at the Will save, this damage does not end the _charm_ effect or the effect of Deceitful Feast as a hostile action normally would.</span>

###  Brughadatches on Golarion

Brughadatches are commonly encountered in wetlands near interplanar portals to the First World, such as in the River Kingdoms, the Mushfens of Varisia, or the Swardlands on the Isle of Kortos. Since they prefer to feed on humans and other similar humanoids, brughadatches often congregate near remote bayou villages and boggy riverside towns, where they can lure in unsuspecting travelers with illusory food and drink. Many a unlucky traveler has fallen victim to the predations of a brughadatch clan after wandering into a spectacular (albeit illusory) banquet, only to realize the ploy too late.
