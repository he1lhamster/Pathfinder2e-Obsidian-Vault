description: "Brownies make their homes in the trunks of hollow trees, small earthy\
  \ burrows, and even under porches or within the crawl spaces of farmhouses. Often\
  \ attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts\
  \ lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often\
  \ is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking\
  \ might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue,\
  \ for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems\
  \ as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally\u2014certainly\
  \ they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no\
  \ swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand\
  \ barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.<br/><br/>When facing danger, brownies\
  \ rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers\
  \ in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love\
  \ of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to\
  \ run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry\
  \ a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call\
  \ their blades their \u201Cfinal trick,\u201D reserving their use for the direst\
  \ of circumstances.<br/><br/>Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always\
  \ repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may\
  \ eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment.\
  \ A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up\
  \ the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years\
  \ and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their\
  \ midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk,\
  \ pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the\
  \ resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos\
  \ away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house\
  \ is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear [[DATABASE/monster/Wolf|wolves]]\
  \ , and they avoid farms with dogs.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Fey</u> (\

# Brughadatch (Midlife Brughadatch)

The biggest difference between a gahlepod and a grown brughadatch isn’t their humanoid appearance, but the powerful magic they gain as they mature.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Deceitful Feast** (illusion) The brughadatch conjures a decadent, enticing feast void of nutritional substance. This conjuration takes 1 minute and lasts for 24 hours. For each item of illusory food a creature eats, it must attempt a DC 29 Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature sees through the illusion and becomes immune to the effects of Deceitful Feast for 24 hours.
**Success** The creature doesn’t see through the illusion but is unaffected by the food.
**Failure** The creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Will saves against any of the brughadatch’s spells or abilities. The penalty increases with each failed save, to a maximum of –5.
**Critical Failure** As failure, plus for 1 hour, the creature’s attitude becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Helpful|helpful]] to the brughadatch, and the creature can’t use hostile actions against them.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Psychic Sip** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** Targets must have critically failed a save against a brughadatch’s Deceitful Feast or [[DATABASE/spell/Charm|charm]] innate spell; **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The brughadatch feasts on the souls of the creatures they’ve tricked.

###  Brughadatches on Golarion

Brughadatches are commonly encountered in wetlands near interplanar portals to the First World, such as in the River Kingdoms, the Mushfens of Varisia, or the Swardlands on the Isle of Kortos. Since they prefer to feed on humans and other similar humanoids, brughadatches often congregate near remote bayou villages and boggy riverside towns, where they can lure in unsuspecting travelers with illusory food and drink. Many a unlucky traveler has fallen victim to the predations of a brughadatch clan after wandering into a spectacular (albeit illusory) banquet, only to realize the ploy too late.
