# Ba'aupa Mdoudu

Ba'aupa mdoudus are solitary, bone-eating creatures that prefer to feed on remains found on battlefields or within necropolises—the more ancient, the better. When unable to locate buried remains, ba'aupa mdoudus are drawn reluctantly to the surface in search of bones from the living; living bones can sustain a ba'aupa mdoudu, but the flavor (particularly the temperature of warm bones fresh from the flesh) unsettles them a bit.
 Ba'aupa mdoudus produce a slimy acid that liquefies minerals, allowing them to burrow though even solid stone and strip natural deposits of calcium from nearby rocks. In doing so, they leave smooth tunnels in their wake. When provoked, ba'aupa mdoudus secrete this acid through numerous pores along their length as a defensive response and accelerate this secretion under extreme circumstances.

###  Inorganic Treasure

The caustic acid of the ba'aupa mdoudu is extremely corrosive to organic material and stone but has minimal effect on metal and gems. Tombs raided by the ba'aupa mdoudu are thus typically devoid of any remains or organic materials; however, armor, weapons, and other inorganic artifacts are normally found intact.
