description: 'Though the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] is mostly
  liquid, it does contain its share of solid material, whether in the form of free-floating
  aquatic plants, hunks of coral, or even detritus from lost underwater cities. Flotsam
  and jetsam collect across the plane, and olobigondes are just one of the many creatures
  that have evolved to live among and consume this detritus. These flat, round fish
  are covered in a moss-like skin that makes them exceptionally difficult to spot
  as they hug the sides of flotsam, feeding off the waste that drifts into their wide,
  open mouths.<br/><br/> While olobigondes are primarily detritivores, they''ve been
  known to lie in wait within a forest of kelp or against a mossy stone to ambush
  smaller creatures, such as water scamps or lone passing merfolk. The fish launch
  themselves from their hiding spot to take large bites out of their surprised prey,
  then grab the victim as it tries to flee. Despite their size and ungainly shape,
  olobigondes can move quickly in water, though their bursts of speed are usually
  short-lived. In addition to maintaining a firm hold on prey, olobigondes'' mouths
  are filled with a unique toxin that weakens and decomposes living flesh. The hungry
  fish easily gulp down the resulting slurry.<br/><br/> Ancient olobigondes grow truly
  immense, and their outward appearance evolves. There seems to be no limit to their
  size. Their skin even separates into plates with deep channels where water can accumulate,
  giving them the appearance of an entire patch of detritus rather than one piece.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall

# Omox (Slime Demon)

Seemingly made from living, animated filth, omoxes have no true anatomy, although they generally spend most of their time in roughly humanoid shapes, resembling some grim caricatures of half-melted humanoids. While scholars once believed these foul demons to be a pure, concentrated form of the corruption that suffuses the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] and its inhabitants, in truth these demons arise from the souls of those who routinely befouled and polluted their surroundings in life.

**Cleanly Vulnerability** An omox embodies filth, and they find the concept of cleanliness abhorrent. An omox subjected to an effect that cleans them, such as the tidy command of [[DATABASE/spell/Prestidigitation|prestidigitation]], takes 2d6 mental damage. They also take this damage the first time each round a creature hit by one of the omox's attacks spends actions cleaning off the filth.
