# Omox (Slime Demon)

Seemingly made from living, animated filth, omoxes have no true anatomy, although they generally spend most of their time in roughly humanoid shapes, resembling some grim caricatures of half-melted humanoids. While scholars once believed these foul demons to be a pure, concentrated form of the corruption that suffuses the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] and its inhabitants, in truth these demons arise from the souls of those who routinely befouled and polluted their surroundings in life.

**Cleanly Vulnerability** An omox embodies filth, and they find the concept of cleanliness abhorrent. An omox subjected to an effect that cleans them, such as the tidy command of [[DATABASE/spell/Prestidigitation|prestidigitation]], takes 2d6 mental damage. They also take this damage the first time each round a creature hit by one of the omox's attacks spends actions cleaning off the filth.
