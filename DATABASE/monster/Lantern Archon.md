# Lantern Archon

Friendly, curious, and eternally optimistic, lantern archons embody the virtue of hope. They are formed of living light given corporeal shape, and they serve as beacons, guiding mortals out of their darkest moments and toward the path of righteousness. Their luminous bodies can flicker with the subtlety of a candle flame or flare up like a torch. Lantern archons can control all aspects of their light as easily as other creatures control their facial expressions, leading them to change color, twinkle, and otherwise dim and brighten in time with their actions and words. While effervescent and chipper in conversation, lantern archons are impressively stoic mobile support troops and guardians in times of conflict, and are capable of uniting to form powerful warriors of light called gestalts.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Gestalt** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (concentrate, divine, transmutation) Nine lantern archons can use this activity, all within 1 round of the first, to merge together to form a composite being for 7 rounds that appears as a glowing warrior of light. The gestalt has the base statistics of a legion archon (AC, saving throws, attacks, skills, Speeds, and so on) but the spells and special abilities of a lantern archon. Additionally, it has a ranged light ray Strike (+18 attack, **Damage** 3d4 fire and 3d4 good), and the bonus from its Lantern of Hope increases to +3. When the gestalt separates, its remaining Hit Points are divided evenly among the lantern archons, and if the gestalt had fewer than 9 HP, some of the lantern archons die.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Lantern of Hope** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, enchantment, mental) The lantern archon shines as a beacon of hope.
