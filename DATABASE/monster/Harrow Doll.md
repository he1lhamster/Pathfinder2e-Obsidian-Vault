# Harrow Doll

Harrow dolls are unique constructs that can make predictions about the future. The more elite circuses and traveling shows frequently feature a harrow doll, and many use the doll’s abilities to learn more about locals to better customize shows to their tastes—or to find easy marks for later cons. Upset patrons that try to harm a harrow doll or reclaim their payment quickly learn that the construct is more than capable of defending itself.

**Uncanny Divination** A harrow doll can cast [[Augury]] as part of a harrow reading, which takes the usual 10 minutes. When casting [[Locate]], the harrow doll doesn’t need to have previously observed a specific object to learn its direction, but instead can detail the direction only vaguely, using such phrases as “beside a weeping mound” or “beneath the lost sky.” When the harrow doll casts [[Mind Reading]], there is no effect if the target critically succeeds its save. Each time a harrow doll makes a harrow reading, it also changes which saving throw is affected by its fortune’s favor ability.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Fortune’s Favor** (fortune) Whenever the harrow doll attempts a specific type of saving throw, it rolls twice and takes the higher result. The type of saving throw is determined by the suit that featured most prominently in the doll’s most recent harrow reading: Fortitude (Hammers or Shields), Reflex (Keys or Books), or Will (Stars or Crowns). If the suit of its latest harrow reading is unknown, roll 1d6 at the beginning of combat to randomly determine it.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Harrowing Misfortune** (curse, misfortune) A creature struck by one of the harrow doll’s cards must attempt a DC 25 Will save or be cursed with misfortune, which forces the creature to roll twice and take the lower result on its next roll of a specific type, determined by the card’s suit (roll 1d6 to randomly determine the suit). A creature can be cursed with only one effect from harrowing misfortune at a time, with a new curse overriding any previous curse. The curse ends after 1 minute or after the specified roll is made, whichever comes first. The suits and their effects are: Hammers (melee attack roll), Keys (Reflex save), Shields (Fortitude save), Books (skill check), Stars (Will save), and Crowns (spell attack roll).</span>
