# Voidglutton

A voidglutton is a powerful type of [[Will-o’-Wisp]] that haunts a site where misery dwells—such as a graveyard, prison camp, or recent battlefield. A voidglutton appears as a seething sphere of glowing eyes swirling around an empty black vortex 4 feet wide. From within this vortex extend long, semi-transparent tendrils that end in seven-fingered, needled hands.
**Recall Knowledge - Aberration ([[Occultism]])**: DC 29
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 27
**Specific Lore**: DC 24

It regains 3d4 Hit Points and its Glow reignites if it had been extinguished. It cannot use Consume Light again for 1d4 rounds, as it is too glutted on fear to suppress its Glow.</span>

###  Agents of Empty Death

As with [[Will-o’-Wisp]] and their less powerful kin, [[Flickerwisp]], voidgluttons are associated with the Outer Goddess [[Nhimbaloth]]. Her cultists see voidgluttons as roving incarnations of her hunger and have been known to offer themselves up to voidgluttons as prey in order to achieve religious insights. Most who attempt this get a closer look at death than they intended.
