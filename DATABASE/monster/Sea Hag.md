# Sea Hag

Sea hags kill and eat fishers and sailors who come near their lairs, torment coastal dwellers with dark promises and vague threats, and enjoy the act of causing distress and discord in small towns. They generally avoid making their lairs too close to civilization, however, to avoid drawing enemies to their homes. Sea hags are known for tempting desperate victims into tragic and inescapable bargains, deals which the hag has already secretly stacked in her favor. Despite their voracious appetites, sea hags appear hideously emaciated, and unlike more powerful hags, they lack the ability to magically disguise their form.
 Sea hags can join covens, but their aquatic nature often prevents them from joining mixed covens with other kinds of hags.

 **Sea Hag’s Bargain** (necromancy, occult) The sea hag can make a bargain with a willing creature, who must be of sound mind. The creature gives away a special or cherished quality—such as its courage, its beauty, or its voice—in exchange for a boon or a promise from the sea hag. As long as the sea hag keeps her end of the bargain, the only way to restore the lost quality is to defeat the sea hag or make another bargain for its return.
