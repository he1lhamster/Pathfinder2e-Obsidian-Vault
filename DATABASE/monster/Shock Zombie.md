# Zombie, Shock

Shock zombies are hideous undead covered with bolts and electrical wiring. Most have two large electric coils mounted on their backs to absorb and project electricity. If uncontrolled, shock zombies often wander far afield in search of inventors' labs or lightning storms to draw power from. In a pinch, the natural electric currents inside living creatures more than suffice.

## Zombie Abilities

You can modify shock zombies with the following zombie abilities, in addition to those available to all zombies. Most shock zombies have one of these abilities; if you give a shock zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. 
**Arcing Strikes** (electricity) When a shock zombie hits a creature with a melee attack, an arc of lighting leaps to a second creature, dealing 1d12 electricity damage. This secondary target must be within 10 feet of the shock zombie's original target and must be the creature closest to the original target (if multiple creatures are equidistant, the shock zombie chooses which to affect). 
**Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (electricity, evocation) The shock zombie breathes lightning, dealing 4d12 electricity damage in a 40-foot line (DC 24 basic Reflex save). It can't use its Breath Weapon again for 1 minute. 
**Electromechanical Phasing** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (electricity) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The shock zombie activates its electromechanical components and begins phasing in and out of reality. The shock zombie casts [[Blink]] as a 4th-level divine innate spell. 
**Lightning Rod** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (electricity) **Trigger** A spell or ability with the electricity trait is used within 30 feet of the shock zombie; **Effect** The shock zombie attempts to counteract the spell or ability (counteract level 3, counteract modifier +17), harmlessly redirecting the electricity into one of its electricity coils.
**Recall Knowledge - Undead ([[Religion]])**: DC 24
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 22
**Specific Lore**: DC 19

###  Nature Shock

While most shock zombies are created through combined necromancy and engineering, some have more natural origins. Corpses of creatures slain by lightning strikes or lightning magic sometimes arise as shock zombies without the need for mechanical components.
