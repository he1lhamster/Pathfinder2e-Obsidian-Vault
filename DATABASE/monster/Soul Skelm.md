# Soul Skelm

Soul skelms arise not from mortal men but from other skelms, as their long-held wrath slowly twists them and replaces lingering fragments of their mortality with even more fiendish aspects. These skelms bully and exploit the souls of the dead, binding souls and undead to keep themselves indefinitely young. They bully living victims as well, stoking regret and shame even from inconsequential minutiae or outright fabrications until these feelings become unbreakable ties that the skelm can leverage from beyond the grave. A soul skelm's attentions can leave a victim isolated from friends and allies, making them all the more susceptible to the skelm's manipulations.
 Ambitious soul skelms—often those who arise from [[DATABASE/monster/Palace Skelm|palace skelms]]—search out powerful, high-strung mortals and trick them into bringing ridicule or shame on themselves. After their victim's death, the skelms gleefully remind them of their mortal failings, feeding on their despair.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bully the Departed** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, emotion, mental, occult, enchantment) The skelm draws upon the spirit of one of his deceased victims, tormenting their soul beyond the grave. Until the end of his next turn, the soul skelm gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Regeneration|regeneration]] 15 (deactivated by force or good), and he deals an extra 1d8 evil damage on his Strikes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The soul skelm can take on the appearance of any Medium male humanoid. This doesn't change his Speed or his attack and damage bonuses with his Strikes but might change the damage type his Strikes deal.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Isolating Lash** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (illusion, occult) The soul skelm makes a melee Strike trailing a wave of shadowy illusions. The skelm is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of his next turn. If the Strike is successful, the skelm increases the number of damage dice by one, and the target must attempt a DC 29 Will save. On a failure, the target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], inaudible, and otherwise imperceptible to its allies for 4 rounds, and it likewise can't see, hear, or otherwise perceive those allies. Regardless of the outcome, the creature is temporarily immune to Isolating Lash for 24 hours.</span>
