# Ararda

[[Shaitan]] corrupted by the Black Desert's blightburn become scorpion-like arardas. While other earth genies sparkle with the iridescence of gemstones and evoke the power of the earth itself, arardas use their connection to the ground to harness the might of electricity. Arardas are so infused with this radioactive crystal that their mere presence is toxic to most living creatures.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Blightburn Radiation** (abjuration, arcane, aura, disease) 60 feet. Blightburn crystals infused into an ararda's body attempt to counteract any teleportation spell moving into or out of the aura's emanation (counteract check +31; 7th level). In addition, any creature that starts its turn within the emanation is exposed to [[Blightburn Sickness]]. The aura is blocked by lead sheeting, 1 foot of stone, or large force effects (such as a [[Wall of Force]], but not a [[Shield]] spell). An ararda can suppress their aura with an action that has the concentrate trait.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Charged Earth** (electricity) Any creature that hits an ararda with an unarmed attack or touches the ararda takes 2d8 electricity damage. Weapons that hit an ararda also take 2d8 electricity damage.</span>
