# Formian Mageslayer

Grim, twisted formians forced into existence through the machinations of the King of Biting Ants, formian mageslayers are created for the express purpose of neutralizing and destroying enemy spellcasters. Wired to never sleep, mageslayers are tortured hunters and guardians whose only relief is found in tearing apart the magic and flesh of spellcasters who oppose the King of Biting Ants. Formian mageslayers have wings resembling those of dragonflies and longer, sleeker bodies than most formians.

**Disrupting Aura** (abjuration, aura, primal) 30 feet. Formian mageslayers are surrounded by an aura of disruptive energy that disperses magical energy and makes spellcasting difficult for their enemies. Whenever an enemy creature within the aura attempts to Cast a Spell or Activate a magic item, they must roll a DC 5 flat check; on a failed check, the spell or activation is lost and the action is wasted. Free action activations disrupted by this aura can't be attempted again until the start of the activating creature's next turn.
**Hive Mind** (divination, primal) Formians operate from a shared hive intelligence that allows them to communicate nearly instantaneously. While within telepathic range of at least one other formian from the same hive mind, a formian worker gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative checks, Perception checks, and saving throws against mental effects. If one formian is aware of a combatant, all members of the hive mind within range are aware of it.

They use their [[Arcana]] modifier as their counteract modifier with a counteract level of 8. If the formian mageslayer succeeds, they counter the spell and use the dispersed energy to gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to twice the spell's level for 1 minute. If the formian mageslayer critically fails this counteract check, their disrupting aura deactivates for 1 minute.</span>
