# Tumblak

Tumblaks prey upon fears of constriction, claustrophobia, or being buried alive. They appear as a roughly rectangular mass of mismatched parts from multiple bodies, as though several people were compressed in a coffin together and became inextricably tangled. Tumblaks enjoy lairing in crypts and collapsed buildings, and they phase through the rubble and tombs to seek prey. Mortals struggle to breathe in a tumblak's presence, which further heightens their terror.

**Easy to Call** A sahkil's level is considered 2 lower for the purpose of being conjured by the [[DATABASE/ritual/Planar Binding|planar binding]] ritual (and potentially other rituals, at the GM's discretion), but is always free to attack or leave instead of negotiate unless the primary caster's check is a critical success.
**Focused Force** Unlike most incorporeal creatures, a tumblak can make Strength-based checks against physical creatures and objects if it chooses, though such creatures still can't make Strength-based checks against the tumblak.

### Spiritual Aversions

Tumblaks are well-versed in burial rites from many diferent cultures. Some tumblaks believe themselves to be subject to efects that ward or soothe ghosts, even though they themselves aren’t undead. For example, tumblaks might become calm upon hearing a prayer to soothe the dead, or uneasy around bells used to ward of restless spirits.
