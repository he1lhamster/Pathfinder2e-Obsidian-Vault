# Angazhani

Angazhanis lurk in the depths of the world's jungles, where these sapient, four-armed apes prey on any creatures they deem lesser than themselves. They're purportedly the divine minions of [[DATABASE/deity/Angazhan|Angazhan]], demon lord of apes. While many angazhanis do worship this foul god, scarce evidence exists to support their claim to fiendish heritage. Jungle-dwelling people know well to steer clear of suspected angazhani territories; angazhanis of such areas don't slaughter outright, often capturing trespassers to serve as slaves or as living sacrifices in heinous rituals.

Even on a failed attack, the angazhani deals the damage from one fist Strike to the target, though they still miss completely on a critical failure. This ability counts as four attacks toward an angazhani's multiple attack penalty.

###  Jungle Murderers

On Golarion, angazhanis dwell almost exclusively in remote reaches of the vast Mwangi Jungle. Many of them served the hateful Gorilla King Ruthazek in Usaro, but after his downfall over a decade ago, these supplicants have fallen into infighting. The mysterious Mwangi warrior Shosenbe is attempting to reunite the angazhanis of Usaro, though not all of the fallen Gorilla King's former minions are eager to follow a human leader.
