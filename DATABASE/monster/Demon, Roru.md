# Demon, Roru

Rorus, sometimes called hunter demons, are brutal fiends that arise from the souls of mortals who mutilated animal corpses. As demons, these individuals don animal pelts, then infiltrate packs or herds to corrupt entire swaths of animals, turning their victims bloodthirsty and feral.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Incite Ferocity** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, enchantment, mental) The roru focuses its corruption on an animal or beast it can see within 30 feet. The creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1d4 rounds. The confused creature can't attack the roru. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is temporarily immune to Incite Ferocity for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wear Pelt** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, manipulate, transmutation) The roru dons the pelt of an adjacent dead animal, transforming into its lookalike. The roru becomes the same size and gains the same Speeds as the target animal. The roru loses its claw and jaws unarmed Strikes and gains the types of melee Strikes of the animal whose pelt it wears. The Strike deals damage equal to the roru's jaws Strike or, if the Strike has the agile trait, the roru's claw Strike. Either way, the damage type changes to match the new unarmed attack. While a roru wears a pelt, half of physical damage dealt to the roru is instead dealt to the pelt. A pelt has Hardness 5 and 25 HP. When a pelt reaches 0 HP, the roru is immediately expelled from the pelt and it is destroyed.</span>

###  Hunting Grounds

Rorus on the Material Plane prefer to corrupt animals in wilderness areas near humanoid-populated areas. The most brazen rorus operate within settlements, posing as mundane animals or leading cults in slaughterhouses.
