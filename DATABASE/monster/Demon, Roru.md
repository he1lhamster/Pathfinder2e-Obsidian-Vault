description: "To all but the most sharp-eyed underground explorers, a roper appears\
  \ to be nothing more than a large stalactite, stalagmite, or pillar of ice. Cunning\
  \ and patient ambush predators, ropers use this to their advantage.<br/><br/> Ropers\
  \ do not form large societies (although they can often be found living alongside\
  \ other deep-dwelling denizens), but they often congregate in small clusters and\
  \ sometimes hunt in groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and\
  \ death and the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world,\
  \ a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat.\
  \ Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper\u2019s appetite by entertaining\
  \ it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow\
  \ such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters\
  \ and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational\
  \ companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don\u2019t eventually\
  \ escape, the ropers\u2019 appetites win out over their intellectual curiosity\u2014\
  especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers\u2019 wits\
  \ and patience. A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Demon, Roru

Rorus, sometimes called hunter demons, are brutal fiends that arise from the souls of mortals who mutilated animal corpses. As demons, these individuals don animal pelts, then infiltrate packs or herds to corrupt entire swaths of animals, turning their victims bloodthirsty and feral.

The roru becomes the same size and gains the same Speeds as the target animal. The roru loses its claw and jaws unarmed Strikes and gains the types of melee Strikes of the animal whose pelt it wears. The Strike deals damage equal to the roru's jaws Strike or, if the Strike has the agile trait, the roru's claw Strike. Either way, the damage type changes to match the new unarmed attack. While a roru wears a pelt, half of physical damage dealt to the roru is instead dealt to the pelt. A pelt has Hardness 5 and 25 HP. When a pelt reaches 0 HP, the roru is immediately expelled from the pelt and it is destroyed.</span>

###  Hunting Grounds

Rorus on the Material Plane prefer to corrupt animals in wilderness areas near humanoid-populated areas. The most brazen rorus operate within settlements, posing as mundane animals or leading cults in slaughterhouses.
