# Siege Shard

Sieges provoke lingering feelings of confinement and desperation. These emotions can coalesce as a psychic presence that animates broken battlements as quasi-intelligent constructs dubbed siege shards. The shard's surface depicts the conflicts that created it, which hold the key to dispersing its psychic presence. A successful DC 18 check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] is sufficient to identify the conflict that engendered the construct. A creature aware of a shard's generative conflict can attempt the following activity.

###  Unique Siege Shards

Especially charged events, such as the clash of two bitter rivals or the destruction of a neighborhood, can create a stronger psychic presence resulting in a more powerful siege shard with potent innate psychic abilities. This shard's surfaces still display images of conflict, but it might take significant research to determine such a shard's origins.
