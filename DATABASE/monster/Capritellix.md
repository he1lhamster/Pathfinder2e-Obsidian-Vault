# Capritellix

The [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Metal|Plane of Metal]] can seem unpredictable to the point of cruelty, and capritellixes embody this perfectly. With a head formed of discs that each depict a portion of their face, a capritellix reshapes their personality with a quick whir.
 Despite their different faces, each capritellix has a unified identity, with one memory and one name. Each mood that cycles through the pieces of their face is a massively amplified facet of their personality, rather than a completely different individual. The differences are subtle to most observers, but a capritellix can display numerous mood combinations—typically 64 for one with four faces per disc or 125 for one with five faces per disc. No matter how much they change their face, however, capritellixes can't suppress their haughty ego or shake the ceaseless despair they feel.
 The conflicting priorities of each mood within a capritellix make it difficult for any of these creatures to make long-term plans or form solid relationships. What one face builds up, another undermines, cursed all the while with full knowledge of the former intentions they will never fulfill and the well-laid plans they will abandon.

###  Recycled Remains

When horribly damaged or weary, capritellixes travel to a communal necropolis, much like a fabled elephant graveyard. Thousands of metallic hands reach up from the landscape, clawing at the sky, and severed discs that used to make up capritellixes pile up in endless heaps. Other elementals sometimes salvage these disparate parts and assemble them into a new capritellix—a unique individual with a brand-new identity.
