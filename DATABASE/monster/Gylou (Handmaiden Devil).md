description: "A guthallath is an enormous construct created long ago by some unknown\
  \ empire, probably as a war machine. Nearly 100 feet tall, this massive stone statue\
  \ typically resembles a stalwart warrior wearing only a loincloth and skullcap.\
  \ Few have seen the entire body of a guthallath, though; most of the time such a\
  \ relic is buried up to its neck, covered in moss and stranded in some forgotten\
  \ place. Yet, every so often, one of these harbingers of destruction reactivates\
  \ in response to some unknown stimulus or rallying call, and when this happens,\
  \ woe be unto any who stand in its way.<br/><br/> While the guthallath\u2019s ancient\
  \ enemies are gone, it is an engine of pure destruction, designed to rampage for\
  \ weeks or even months. While not intelligent enough to enjoy or regret its acts,\
  \ the guthallath cannot be reasoned with\u2014it is unaffected by most magic, and\
  \ is unpredictable in how it selects its targets (and creatures it spares).<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Gylou (Handmaiden Devil)

Though gylous are deeply entrenched in the expansive and complex machinations of [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell]], they are highly skilled agents capable of nuanced diplomacy, masterful deception, physical finesse, and nearly any other tasks they set their minds to. This versatility has led to gylous becoming widespread throughout all layers of Hell, enabling them to filter key information to their masters regarding other devils' plots and schemes. Their allegiance is no secret, but their skills are so great that powerful devils employ one or more gylous regardless. While most gylous have a feminine form (combined with their role, this is the source of their common moniker of “handmaiden”), some have other gender presentations, and nearly all gylous take on carefully cultivated illusions to best suit the roles they fill. More often than not, gylous arise when lesser devils who have demonstrated exceptional utility and invaluable skills are uplifted into a new form, though on rare occasions they are shaped from the souls of evil mortals who showed unparalleled savvy within bureaucratic enterprises.
