# Storm Hag

Storm hags are the personification of a storm's rage. These crones hate those who huddle together with loved ones in warm, dry shelters while the wind howls and rain lashes the land and sea. Storm hags use their powers to wreak havoc on communities near the coastal caves or hovels where they often live.
 These hags send their voices on the wind to terrorize mortals before descending upon them with claws and fell magic. More than any others of their kind, they prey on the young, devouring children as much for the pain it causes their parents and caretakers as for the hags' love of young flesh.
 A storm hag's territory sometimes overlaps with that of [[DATABASE/monster/Sea Hag|sea hags]] and [[DATABASE/monster/Winter Hag|winter hags]]. While this may result in the formation of a coven that controls their combined territories, more often it leads to rivalries. Such feuds only increase the misery of innocent people caught between the rival hags' feuding.

**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Coven|Coven]]** A storm hag adds [[DATABASE/spell/Hydraulic Torrent|hydraulic torrent]], [[DATABASE/spell/Lightning Storm|lightning storm]], and [[DATABASE/spell/Mariner's Curse|mariner's curse]] to her coven's spells.
**Stormsight** Wind, precipitation, and clouds don't impair a storm hag's vision; she ignores the [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] condition from storms, mist, precipitation, and the like.
**Voice of the Storm** A storm hag can send spoken messages or sounds on the wind to any spot that she has seen and the wind can reach within a 50-mile radius. She can send a quiet whisper or a loud scream, and decides whether it's clearly audible or barely heard above the wind. The message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The hag can use this ability to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] creatures that hear her message with dire threats or unnerving whispers of doom.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Stormcalling** A storm hag can perform a special [[DATABASE/ritual/Control Weather|control weather]] ritual, which requires no secondary casters, to change the weather within 5 miles of her location for 4d12 hours. The primary check is a DC 23 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] check, and she can't get an outcome worse than a failure. The storm hag can create only hurricanes, thunderstorms, and tornadoes, but she can do so regardless of the current season. She can also quell natural weather events but never willingly does so.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wind Mastery** A storm hag is unaffected by strong winds, natural or magical. Windy conditions are not difficult terrain for her.</span>
