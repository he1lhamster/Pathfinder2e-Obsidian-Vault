# Ovinnik

The ovinnik is the most ferocious of house spirits, and the only one that will kill if sufficiently angered. They live in granaries, storage rooms, and sheds where food—particularly grain—is kept. Ovinniks resemble bipedal cats but bark like a dog to scare away thieves, and they often demand gifts of milk, pancakes, and dead roosters.

**Master of the Granary** A granary with a friendly ovinnik is blessed, as the preserves food from vermin and mold and does a hundred other small tasks. A granary so blessed never suffers from random accidents such as fires, and any checks to [[Craft]], [[Earn Income]], [[Repair]], or [[Subsist]] in the granary receive a +2 circumstance bonus. If the ovinnik is unfriendly, such checks take a –2 circumstance penalty instead, as the ovinnik causes devastating fires and infestations and otherwise makes life a misery. A ovinnik must spend a week in a place before these benefits occur.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Raise Grain Cloud** <span class="action-icon">2</span> While in their bound storeroom or granary, the ovinnik slams a paw against the ground, stirring up a cloud of grain dust in an 20-foot emanation. Within this cloud, they gain a +4 status bonus to any fire damage they deal. The ovinnik doubles their fire resistance against this increased damage. The grain cloud dissipates after the first such effect or after 1 minute if no such effects occur.</span>

###  Ovinnik's Foretelling

Ovinniks, on certain days, might deign to tell the future. Peasants approach the window of the fey's domain and present their bare palms. If the ovinnik touches them with a furred paw, then their family lives will be good. A smooth hand, however, signals brewing strife.
