# Bida

Bidas are black-scaled dragons with long, serpentine bodies and bat-like wings. Their legs and claws are smaller than those of most dragons, but their powerful undulating coils, like those of a boa constrictor, are potent weapons capable of squeezing the life from several unfortunate victims at a time.
 A bida uses its impressive intellect and powerful magic to pose as a humanoid and infiltrate a settlement. Over the course of weeks or months, it establishes itself as a key member of the village, and only after it has become invaluable to the community does it reveal the terrible price of its assistance: regular offerings of flesh and gold. From this point on, the bida dwells almost exclusively within its smoggy lair, growing fat off the blood of its sacrificial offerings. To hide its presence from the outside world, a bida conceals its enslaved settlement in a large-scale illusion, leaving only a stand of jungle trees where once a thriving village may have been and ordering the townsfolk to destroy any roads in and out of town.
 Bidas begrudgingly tolerate others of their kind, instead preferring the company of their small, tasty thralls. In rare cases, a pair of bidas may join forces to conquer a particularly large settlement, extracting that much more wealth (and blood) from the populace as a result of their partnership.

###  Bida Locations

Bidas claim thorps, hamlets, and villages as their territories, preferring semi-industrialized settlements that control nearby coal or gold mines they can use as lairs.

###  Bida Treasure

Bidas, like most dragons, are fond of treasure, particularly gold, and their hordes are spectacular to behold. Although the wealth in a bida’s cave belongs to the unfortunate villagers the bida has intimidated into servitude, many victims would willingly relinquish their claims to items to convince a party of dragon slayers to eliminate the tyrannical monster.
