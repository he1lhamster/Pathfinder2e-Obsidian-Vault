# Axiomite

According to the axiomites, their kind rose from the raw mathematical underpinnings of the universe, manifesting as great builders who created the ancient, colossal cities of the Outer Planes and gave life to the mechanical inevitables. According to the aeons, axiomites are part of the Monad, having both risen from and rebelled against it long ago. Since the Convergence, most axiomites have recognized this as a fundamental truth, particularly after the aeons showed the axiomites how the Utopian language has formed as an amalgam of aeon envisioning and formulaic mathematical expression. Most axiomites live in the perfect city of Axis, which they continually act to improve, thus refining the concept of perfection itself.
 A particular axiomite may look like any humanoid creature, though the particular form it takes on does not affect its abilities. Beneath this assumed form, all axiomites are the same—clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that constantly swirls and congeals into complex tangles of symbols and equations, evincing their existence as literal creatures of pure mathematical law.
 Axiomites arise from the souls of lawful neutral mortals, particularly those who were, in life, mathematicians, architects, crafters, or philosophers. While these souls do not retain any memories of their lives in the transition into axiomites, their life skills and experiences nevertheless serve a valuable metaphysical resource during formation.

In this form it gains a fly Speed of 40 feet and can fit through even tiny apertures, similarly to [[Gaseous Form]]. It can cast spells, but it can’t make melee or ranged attacks in this state. It can return to its humanoid form by using this action while in crystalline dust form.</span>

###  Axiomites in Axis

On the planar metropolis of Axis, an axiomite fills one of three roles: construction and maintenance of inevitables, building and repairing Axis’s buildings, and exploring the laws and constants that underlie all of reality.
