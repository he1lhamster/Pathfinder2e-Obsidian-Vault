# Alchemical Golem

This golem is a walking alchemical nightmare capable of inflicting all manner of painful wounds. Its ability to follow orders is granted by the otherwise mindless humanoid brain that floats in its dome-like head. In exceptionally rare cases, the brain used in its creation might retain fragments of memories or even actual intellect, resulting in an alchemical golem with a personality and agenda of its own.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Alchemical Chambers** An alchemical golem’s body contains six alchemical chambers filled with different substances.

Roll on the alchemical chambers list (see above) to determine which one shatters—on a roll of 1–5, creatures in the area take 10d6 damage of the appropriate type (DC 28 basic Reflex).

Determine the type of bomb created by rolling 1d6 on the alchemical chambers list above. On a roll of 1–4, it creates the corresponding greater alchemical bomb: an [[DATABASE/equipment/Acid Flask|acid flask]] from chamber 1, a [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost Vial|frost vial]] from chamber 2, [[DATABASE/equipment/Bottled Lightning|bottled lightning]] from chamber 3, or [[DATABASE/equipment/Alchemist's Fire|alchemist’s fire]] from chamber 4. On a roll of 5, it creates a poisonous bomb that deals 3d10 poison damage and 3 poison splash damage with no other effects. On a roll of 6, it creates a sickness bomb, which exposes the target and all creatures in the splash radius to the sickness effect; creatures hit by only the splash receive a +2 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude saves.</span>

###  Alchemical Golems

When an alchemical golem is defeated or disabled, if any of its first four alchemical chambers (1–4) remain intact, the chamber can be salvaged and used as a lesser alchemical bomb of the corresponding type: acid flask, frost vial, bottled lightning, or alchemist's fire, respectively.
