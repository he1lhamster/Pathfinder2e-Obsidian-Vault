# Vulpinal (Fox Agathion)

Vulpinals serve as the cunning and clever musicians and minstrels of the agathions. Incredibly far-ranging, these fox-like humanoids love traveling to learn and teach about all the unique songs, dances, myths, and traditions they can find. Though they prefer to travel alone, vulpinals are extremely gregarious toward those they meet on their journeys. They enjoy participating in the festivities of cultures they encounter, and they're known to form small traveling groups of like-minded individuals if they believe that their shared expertise can prove beneficial.

###  Vulpinal Flair

Bipedal vulpinals stand around 3 feet tall, with humanoid clawed hands and fluffy tails almost as long as their bodies. They typically appear with red fur, though leaders feature either white or black pelts with gray sprinkled across their muzzles and backs. Fox agathions like to wear stylish but functional clothing from the places they visit, often embellishing themselves with small trinkets and souvenirs they picked up along the way.
