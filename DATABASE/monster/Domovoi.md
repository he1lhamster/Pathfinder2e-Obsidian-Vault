# Domovoi

The elderly domovoi are patrons of the home and the dearest of all house spirits to the people they live with. Families with a domovoi leave a bowl of milk in the corner of the home in thanks, and peasants often take great pains to coax a domovoi to follow them to a new house.
 An enraged domovoi rallies the home itself in their defense. Anything in the house could betray its residents. Crockery falls onto the heads of attackers, doors slam in their faces, carpets tangle their feet, and woe betide the attacker if someone has hung a sword on the wall.

**Master of the Home** A home with a friendly domovoi is blessed, as the domovoi cooks, cleans, fetches water, and does a hundred other small tasks. A home so blessed never suffers from random accidents such as fires, and any checks to [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]], [[DATABASE/action/Earn Income|Earn Income]], [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repair]], or [[DATABASE/action/Subsist|Subsist]] in the home receive a +2 circumstance bonus. If the domovoi is unfriendly, such checks take a –2 circumstance penalty instead, as the domovoi hides things, makes noise when people try to sleep, tangles weaving, and otherwise makes life a misery. A domovoi must spend a week in a place before these benefits occur.
