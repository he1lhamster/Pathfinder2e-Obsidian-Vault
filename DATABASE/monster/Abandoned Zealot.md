# Abandoned Zealot

Once devout followers whose faith proved false, abandoned zealots return from the doorstep of the afterlife after being denied the eternal reward they expected. Consumed by self-loathing for the lives they squandered to false faiths and empty creeds, these lost souls serve as terrifying and implacable—yet ultimately pathetic—foes. A shapeless mass of smoke and shadow coils behind their broken masks. As abandoned zealots move, they spit and shriek a hateful cacophony of bitter lamentations and anguished weeping.
 Abandoned zealots are most commonly associated with the church of Razmir, which upholds a mortal wizard as a god—a truth unknown to most worshippers. However, abandoned zealots might arise from a true religion if they've been misled about that faith's true tenets or aims. This situation could easily result from the cruel schemes and predations of sinister beings, such as [[DATABASE/monster/Shrine Skelm|shrine skelms]] and the blasphemous devils known as [[DATABASE/monster/Deimavigga (Apostate Devil)|deimavigga]].

###  Liturgies of the Lost

A particular form of abandoned zealot appears near the Starstone Cathedral in the city of Absalom. Mortals who fail to reach divinity through the Test of the _Starstone_ perish and arise as these wrathful undead, despising other aspirants.
