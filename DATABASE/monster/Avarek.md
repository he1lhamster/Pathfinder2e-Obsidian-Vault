# Avarek

Avareks delight in tormenting ship's crews and causing shipwrecks off the coasts of Garund and the Inner Sea. Bipedal, aquatic fey covered in long, urchin-like spines, avareks stand 2 feet tall—or 3 feet tall if measured to the tips of their spines—and weigh fewer than 30 pounds.
 Avareks rely on subtlety and subterfuge to indulge their destructive whims, using magic to sabotage ships and cloud the minds of crew members and passengers. Patient and cunning, avareks lurk beneath or within a targeted vessel for weeks, building conflict and mistrust. Soon, shipmates accuse one another of theft and treachery; superstitious crew members might believe their ship is haunted. Eventually, the crew becomes too frightened or mistrustful to save their ship from the avareks' sabotage.
 Avareks take pride in their sunken trophies, claiming the wrecks of ships they've destroyed as their homes and gorging on the bloated, water-logged corpses of the crew and passengers.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Prickly Defense** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The avarek withdraws beneath its spines, presenting a defensive, spiky exterior. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to spine Strikes and AC. Any adjacent creature that attempts a melee attack against the avarek takes 1d6 piercing damage per attack, regardless of whether the attack hits. Prickly Defense lasts until the avarek uses a move action or makes a Strike with any weapon other than its spines.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rolling Assault** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The avarek curls into a ball and rolls rapidly, impaling enemies with its spines. The avarek Strides twice and makes up to two spine Strikes at any point during its movement, each against a different target within reach. These attacks count toward the avarek's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after the avarek makes all the attacks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Sneak Attack]]** The avarek's Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage to [[Flat-Footed]] creatures.</span>
