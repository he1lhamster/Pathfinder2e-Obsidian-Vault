# Groplit

The groplit is a squat little animal shaped like a water droplet, with a bulbous rear end and an eel-like face that juts from a narrow skull. Its rear legs are more muscular than those in front, which it primarily uses for balance, giving it the gait and appearance of a toad. Groplits are best known for their greasy skin and queasy hygienic habits: they spend most of each day using their two long tongues to slurp up their own oily excretions or similarly viscous discharge originating from plants or other animals. Although they prefer to dwell in northern wetlands, fens, and moist caves, groplits can thrive in all but the most barren environments. They'll eat just about anything, though they tend to prefer small, crunchy animals like bugs and birds.
 Groplits are famously loyal and highly sociable companions, and they make for dedicated, if somewhat odd-looking, pets. They can be taught simple commands and appear to take great pride in obeying them, performing stunts even in the face of obvious danger. An unscrupulous master might train a groplit with the intent to sacrifice it in an emergency, a fate to which the groplit is happily resigned. This single-minded obedience and their slow reproductive rate make groplits fairly rare in the wild.
 As a result of the way their bones are structured, groplits exhibit an imperturbable smile, of sorts—a physical feature which some find as creepy (or enraging) as others find it endearing. Its apparently ceaseless jubilation has given this creature the nickname “the grinning toad” in some parts of the world.
 Because they love to lap up oily matter of all kinds, groplits are naturally drawn to greasy animals like [[Slurk]], [[Giant Slug]], and [[Lagofir]]. For the most part, such animals rarely mind the company of an amiable groplit, though there's no such thing as a free meal; groplits who drop their guard amid their found family often end up on the wrong side of their companions' intestinal tracts.

###  Groplit Grease

The grease excreted from a groplit's skin might look repulsive but has many practical uses when collected and bottled. It naturally repels water and burns quickly, making it a useful fire-starter on wet or windy days. It's also handy for cooking to a high, fast heat, such as to char food. Groplit grease retains its viscous consistency in all but the most extreme temperatures and therefore makes a good lubricant for machines made of stone or metal (although it's a poor lubricant for wood, as friction makes it likely to set the wood aflame). This latter trait has made groplits highly attractive to southerners who rely on such machines.
