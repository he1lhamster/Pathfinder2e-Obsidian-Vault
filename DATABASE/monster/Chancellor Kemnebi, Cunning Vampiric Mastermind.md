# Chancellor Kemnebi, Cunning Vampiric Mastermind

Long ago, in the days before Geb was a nation, Kemnebi was a mortal man with a wife and family. Tragedy struck, and the kindly father dove into dark magic to save the lives of those he loved. Kemnebi can't recall what events he took part in during those early days; he'd long since purged the memories from his mind to make room for memories he considered more useful as well as a wealth of knowledge and skills. What he does recall is by the end of his mortal life his family was dead, he was alone, and he died, coming back through spite, determination, and [[DATABASE/deity/Urgathoa|Urgathoa's]] blessing as a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire, Vetalarana|vetalarana]].
 Kemnebi was reckless in his early days and was nearly destroyed by the monk Balji, whose death he drew out over years as an act of vengeance. Eventually, Balji died, but the simple monk would live on inside Kemnebi, who had let in too many of the monk's memories. This new, enlightened Kemnebi was a far more cautious, cunning, and terrifying predator. He has destroyed countless lives, fed off millions, and rose through Geb's hierarchy to become the most powerful Blood Lord within the nation.
 With [[DATABASE/deity/Arazni|Arazni's]] departure from Geb, the ghost king has returned to rule his nation, and Kemnebi has been forced to accelerate his plans—plans that would've devastated Geb's trade partners, sparked a war, and seen Kemnebi rival Geb himself. Now that the PCs have foiled Kemnebi's plans, Kemnebi has retreated into hiding in his shadow sanctum.

## Campaign Role

Kemnebi is chief among the Blood Lords and the main villain of the Blood Lords Adventure Path. While the characters spend most of the campaign foiling Kemnebi's plans and saving their nation from war, in “Ghost King's Rage,” the characters must finally find and destroy Kemnebi, who hides within his shadow sanctum and plots revenge against both Geb and the meddlesome Blood Lords who have foiled centuries of planning and preparation. Kemnebi is unrepentant and difficult to destroy.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Enlightened Mind** Whenever Kemnebi is targeted by a mental effect, that effect's source or caster must succeed at a DC 5 flat check. If this check fails, the mental effect doesn't affect Kemnebi.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Mental Rebirth curse, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult)** Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]] by the vetalarana and loses the [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> After 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vetalarana Vulnerabilities** All vetalaranas possess the following weaknesses.

* **Barred Senses** A vetalarana can't see or sense through force effects or [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]], and their mind can't penetrate force effects or cold iron. Such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through Mental Rebirth.
* **Revulsion** A vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. A vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. Speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the auditory, concentrate, and linguistic traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. A vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the fleeing condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. After 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).
* **Vulnerable to Brain Destruction** A vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 HP while unable to take mental actions, can't use Mental Rebirth.

This has the effects of the [[DATABASE/spell/Possession|possession]] spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. A comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against Control Comatose.
 As long as a comatose victim is [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]] by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] conditions are temporarily suppressed.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drain Thoughts** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (necromancy, occult) **Requirements** A [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or willing creature is within Kemnebi's reach; **Effect** Kemnebi seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]]f and Kemnebi regains 35 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that's already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to Kemnebi but increases the victim's stupefied value by 2. Additionally, Kemnebi views one of the victim's memories and can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory he views as 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Modify Memory|modify memory]].
 A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.
 A victim who becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently unconscious.

It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.</span>
