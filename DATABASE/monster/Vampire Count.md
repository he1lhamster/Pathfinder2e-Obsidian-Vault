**Children of the Night** (divine, enchantment, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include [[DATABASE/monster/Rat Swarm|rat swarms]], bat swarms, and [[DATABASE/monster/Wolf|wolves]], but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Mist Escape** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. **Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it’s at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.</span>

If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator’s control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire’s Will DC.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Dominate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] (DC 22) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drink Blood** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, necromancy) **Requirement** A [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. **Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]] and the vampire regains 10 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.
 A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Turn to Mist** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [[DATABASE/spell/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]] spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.</span>
