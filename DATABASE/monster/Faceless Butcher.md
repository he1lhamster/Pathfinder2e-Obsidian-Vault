# Faceless Butcher

The deformed flesh on this humanoid horror’s head bears grim holes where their eyes, nose, mouth, and ears should be, and little else. Stories of faceless butchers always center on the monstrous murderer’s preferred weapon: a wicked and bloodstained meat cleaver, which the butcher uses to carve flesh from skull to add to their collection of stolen faces. Once they’ve taken a victim’s face, the faceless butcher can wear it, transform into an exact replica of the deceased, and begin stalking their next victim.

###  Boondocks Killer

Among small villages where locals whisper stories of the faceless butcher, one can never be sure if the local fisher or trapper who returns from an unexpectedly long trip upriver is who they have always been, or if something far more sinister has returned in their stead.
