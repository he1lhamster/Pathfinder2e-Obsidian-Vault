# Cassisian (Archive Angel)

The weakest of angels, cassisians usually serve as lackey messengers for more powerful angels or as spiritual guides for mortals. Despite their limited intellect, cassisians have a knack for precise recollection, particularly with scripture. Most cassisians are formed from the souls of trustworthy mortals, but some arise from fragments of greater angels destroyed in service to the celestial realms.
