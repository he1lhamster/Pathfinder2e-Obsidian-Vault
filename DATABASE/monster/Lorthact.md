# Lorthact

Once, Lorthact was a darling of the powers of [[Hell]], an infernal duke beholden to no single archdevil and rumored to have the favor of the god [[Asmodeus]] himself. But Lorthact was not satisfied in his station—like so many devils— and concocted a plan to reverse roles with [[Eiseth]], one of Hell's Queens of the Night. Lorthact hoped to gain control of the [[Erinys (Fury Devil)]] armies of Hell and a substantial portion of Dis, while Eiseth would take the role of his consort. 
Eiseth uncovered the plot, and Lorthact found himself the target of her legendary fury. His allies and patrons abandoned him, unwilling to bring Eiseth's wrath upon themselves, and Lorthact fled Hell entirely. He leapt from plane to plane, unable to find refuge until at last he slipped Eiseth's pursuit by hiding as a mortal in the city of Korvosa.
 Korvosa proved a fruitful haven and hideout for Lorthact. He quickly found a mortal powerful enough to further his ambition but foolish enough to bargain with him: Volshyenek Ornelos. It wasn't long before Lorthact replaced the man, and for over a century, Lorthact led the Acadamae directly. When Volshyenek's identity drew too much attention from Eiseth's minions, he faked “Ornelos's” death and continued to direct the wizards' college from the shadows until today. He collected souls over the years—primarily through an elaborate hoax known as the Breaching Festival—hoping to eventually rebuild his name and reputation in Hell's hierarchy, but patience was never one of Lorthact's virtues.
 His attempts to quicken the process have backfired twice in recent years, both as the direct result of adventurers accidentally interfering with his plots. In the years since these risky failures, Lorthact sacrificed much of his infernal power to maintain his metaphysical secrecy from Eiseth. Now but a shadow of his former power (already much reduced from his original strength as an Infernal Duke), Lorthact is risking everything in a final attempt to regain an edge by supporting the [[Vampire, Strigoi]] progenitor Aliriel, planning to betray her and claim complete control over Ileosa's soul once she returns to life.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Divination Immunity** As a side effect of existing slightly outside the normal time stream, Lorthact is difficult to detect via divination spells and abilities. These effects function as though Lorthact and items he carries are not present, and those specifically targeting him, such as [[Scrying]], fail entirely unless the source of the divination is a higher level than Lorthact—in which case they succeed only if the caster succeeds at a DC 16 secret flat check.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Arcane Absorption** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (arcane, enchantment, manipulate, mental) **Requirements** Any creature adjacent to Lorthact is [[Stupefied]], capable of casting prepared arcane spells, and is either [[Immobilized]], [[Unconscious]], or willing; **Effect** Lorthact attempts to drain a 1st- through 8th-level prepared spell from the target, who can resist with a successful DC 37 Will saving throw. On a failure or against a willing target, the prepared arcane spell is transferred from that creature as if it were cast, and Lorthact immediately prepares that spell in the same level slot. If he already had a spell prepared in that slot, the previously prepared spell is lost. That creature is then immune to Arcane Absorption for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Arcane Spellcaster** As long as Lorthact has one arcane spell prepared in this way, all arcane spells are on his spell list, which allows him to activate items such as scrolls, wands, and staves. He can recharge his staff of power as a prepared spellcaster by using his arcane spell slots. He has one spell slot to prepare arcane spells of each level from 1st to 8th, and can prepare any Common arcane spell in these slots during his daily preparations. The spells listed above represent those he most typically prepares, but given time, he can adjust this selection as needed for the task at hand.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Scholastic Masquerade** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) Lorthact takes on the appearance of Volshyenek Ornelos or reverts to his true form. In Volshyenek's form, he loses his fly Speed and claw Strikes, doesn't inflict additional mental damage with his Strikes, and reduces his AC to 34. He gains a +4 status bonus on [[Deception]] checks to appear human in this guise.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Staff of Power** Lorthact's [[Staff of Power]] is tipped with a pair of metal tines that grant the weapon the versatile piercing trait.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Thought Theft** (curse, divine, enchantment, mental) Any creature that takes mental damage from Lorthact's claws or staff must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or become [[Stupefied]] (stupefied 2 on a critical failure). Further mental damage dealt by Lorthact increases the value of the stupefied condition by 1 on a failed save to a maximum of stupefied 4. Whenever Lorthact causes a creature to become stupefied in this way, he absorbs some of those thoughts and gains a +1 status bonus on all Will saving throws and Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill checks until the end of his next turn.</span>

###  Lorthact's Cult

Lorthact's cult is incredibly small. Even in his reduced state, he can still grant spells to his few remaining clerics (none of whom appear in this adventure). His symbol is a staff wrapped in scrolls.
