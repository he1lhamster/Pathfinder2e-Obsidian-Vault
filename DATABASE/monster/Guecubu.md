# Guecubu

Sometimes an individual performs acts of horror so unspeakable that the earth they walk on becomes imprinted by their evil. With such villains, even slaying them and scattering their bones can't rid the world of their vile presence. Their souls rise again as guecubus, gruesome skeletons made of scorched bones, rotting flesh, and befouled earth. Guecubus roams the land seeking those they deem responsible for their death.
 A guecubu remembers what was done to them, and the memories of their supposed mistreatment fuel their quest for revenge. Guecubus are well-equipped to exact such vengeance. Along with monstrous power and the ability to move through earth, they retain all the cunning they had in life. These creatures are known to kill their enemies one by one, leaving no trace of their presence behind save pebbles and dust.

The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain, with each square dealing 3 piercing damage to a creature that moves through it. A guecubu is immune to these effects. Ground under the effects of a [[Consecrate]] ritual or a [[Circle of Protection]] spell tuned against evil or chaos can't be affected by this ability.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Earth Glide** The guecubu can Burrow through any earthen matter, including rock.

###  You Again?

A guecubu is one of the clearest manifestations of selfish evil found in the world. They believe they were raised to make their enemies pay for their demise, completely in denial to their own role in those events. Bereft of the henchmen and power they commanded while alive, the guecubu gleefully uses their new powers on those they hate. Many adventurers realize at some point that the guecubu pursuing them is a former foe they believed dispatched.
