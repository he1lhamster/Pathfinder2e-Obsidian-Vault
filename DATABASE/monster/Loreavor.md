# Loreavor

Rarely, when an [[DATABASE/monster/Ioton|ioton]] (the lowliest ennosite) leeches a particularly secretive thought, it can choke to death on the secret, only to be born from its previous body into that of a loreavor: an ennosite whose existence is shaped around the consumption of secrets and artistry.
 Loreavors sip at secrets throughout their lives and are instinctively drawn to obscure information. Their hunger places them firmly at odds with scholars and historians alike. Living victims lose memories; written texts become blank books. Loreavors' favorite sites are ruins and ancient libraries, but they can also survive on banal secrets of everyday life as well. While the creatures are secretive, typically staying out of sight and fleeing danger, they become aggressive when their favored food sources are threatened.
 A loreavor appears as a 3-foot-long, pale, wormlike creature with dozens of half-formed faces growing from its segmented body. Trapped in an area without secrets to eat, a loreavor won't starve and can live for years.

If the spell isn't cast within 24 hours, or if the loreavor uses Reconstruct Spell again before casting the spell, the spell is lost. No more than one loreavor can reconstruct a given spell this way.</span>

###  A One-way Journey

When a loreavor is “born,” it gains the ability to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|plane shift]] once as an innate spell that affects itself only and does so to travel to another plane— typically the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]—when it senses a particularly enticing collection of unprotected secrets or artwork. The GM might determine a loreavor encountered on the [[DATABASE/plane/Astral Plane|Astral Plane]] might not have used this spell yet, affording it a one-time method of escaping conflict if a battle goes against it.
