Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true wereant's natural form is their hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, they use their original humanoid size, lose their jaws and claw Strikes, and gain a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by their mandibles. In animal shape, they take the form of a Medium giant ant, gain a climb Speed of 20 feet, gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grab]] on their mandibles Strike, and lose their weapon Strikes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Curse of the Wereant** (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse affects only humanoids; **Saving Throw** DC 34 Fortitude.

It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to defenses against being [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shoved]] or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Tripped]], and its melee Strikes deal an additional 2d8 mental damage. These effects end when it moves from its square using anything other than Hasty Reposition.</span>
