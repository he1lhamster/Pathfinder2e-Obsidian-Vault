# Violet Fungus

At a glance, a violet fungus might seem to be little more than an unsightly and sickeningly purple mushroom of unusual size. Only once one draws closer— once whip-like tentacles dripping with flesh-rotting venom slither out from the fungus's cratered cap—does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool become apparent. Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the clutches of this monstrous fungus's tentacles, since violet fungi are practically synonymous with caverns on Golarion.
 Anyone who has ever braved the world's caves for an extended period of time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush with this vicious plant's cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Xulgath|Xulgaths]] in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a first line of defense.

###  Deadly Whips

Canny adventurers can harvest a defeated violet fungus's tentacles and use them as [[DATABASE/weapon/Whip|whips]]. The whips inflict violent rot (with the same effects and DC as in the violet fungus's stat block) on anything they touch, including the wielder, although metal gloves such as gauntlets can protect against the poison. Such whips can be used for 1 hour before they degrade and become useless.

###  Violet Venom

Alchemists and poisoners cherish violet fungi for the plants' potent rotting poison, and have perfected an effective method of preserving the toxin as [[DATABASE/equipment/Violet Venom|violet venom]]. After slaying a violet fungus, a character can extract the fungus's toxin with a successful DC 20 [[DATABASE/domain/Nature Domain|Nature]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] check. Afterward, the extracted venom can be [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Crafted]] into 1 dose of violet venom with a successful DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check.
