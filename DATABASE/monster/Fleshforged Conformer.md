# Fleshforged Conformer

Shapeshifting fleshforged conformers have adapted to survive Ecanus's high-magic, population-dense sprawl. Resembling blocky humanoid skeletons splotched in uneven layers with cartilage and muscle, conformers are capable of attaching and detaching flesh from their bodies, often sending autonomous gobbets of fat and ligament to observe living creatures and harvest biological material.
 Fleshforged conformers use their resources to augment and change their bodies, which helps them infiltrate Nexian society to better understand the arcane principles and occult secrets behind their creation. Some assume the guises of humans and animals to lead quiet, settled lives in Nex, but most are discovered and summarily exterminated as defects and threats to public safety.
**Recall Knowledge - Aberration ([[Occultism]])**: DC 24

<span class="in-box-ability">**Conformance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The conformer contorts and reshapes their body into a desired form. The conformer takes on the specific appearance of any Small, Medium, or Large humanoid or animal that they've observed and whose appearance they remember. This doesn't change the conformer's Speed or their attack and damage bonus with their Strikes, but might change the damage type their Strikes deal.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Surgical Detachment** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, manipulate, morph, occult, transmutation) The conformer detaches part of their body to serve them as an autonomous organism. For the next 24 hours, the conformer gains the loyal service of a [[Fleshforged Skinskitter]]. As long as they remain within 1 mile of each other, the conformer can use the Surgical Detachment action again to empathically direct the actions of their skinskitter servant as well as perceive through its senses. Due to how taxing this process is, the conformer can have only one skinskitter servant at a time.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tissue Siphon** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate, occult, transmutation) **Requirements** The conformer is within reach of an [[Unconscious]] or willing creature, or a creature taking [[Persistent Damage]]; **Effect** The conformer touches and absorbs some of the creature's flesh. The target must attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save; on a failure, they become [[Drained]] and take damage from their persistent bleed damage, even though it isn't the end of their turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wear Flesh** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (transmutation, occult) **Requirements** The conformer has used Tissue Siphon to absorb flesh within the last hour; **Effect** The conformer expends the flesh they've absorbed to transform their body, reproducing the effects of one of the following spells: [[Adapt Self]], [[Enlarge]], [[Shifting Form]], [[Tentacular Limbs]], or [[Unusual Anatomy]]. The Wear Flesh action gains the traits of the spell it's reproducing, and the conformer can Sustain a Spell on these effects.</span>

###  Paranoia's Price

The presence of fleshforged conformers has a predictably deleterious effect on society, even without any hostile actions taken by the fleshforged themselves. Many Nexians who know of the creatures constantly scan their neighbors for any sign of deception, and more than one reckless murder has been committed simply out of the mistaken belief they were actually a conformer is disguise.
