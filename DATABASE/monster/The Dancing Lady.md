**Success **The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round and is temporarily immune to Captivating Dance for 24 hours.

The baobhan sith attempts an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC. On a success, the victim becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] and the baobhan sith regains 10 HP, gaining any Hit Points in excess of their maximum Hit Points as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a victim that's already drained doesn't restore any Hit Points to the baobhan sith but increases the victim's drained value by 1. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires 10 minutes, a successful DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check, and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1.</span>
