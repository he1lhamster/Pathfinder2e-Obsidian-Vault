**Critical Success **The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Captivating Dance for 24 hours. 
**Success **The creature is [[Slowed]] for 1 round and is temporarily immune to Captivating Dance for 24 hours. 
**Failure **The creature is [[Fascinated]], and it must spend at least 1 of its actions on each of its turns to move closer to the baobhan sith as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the creature ends its movement or turn adjacent to the fey, it is slowed 1 until the end of its next turn.

The baobhan sith attempts an [[Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC. On a success, the victim becomes [[Drained]] and the baobhan sith regains 10 HP, gaining any Hit Points in excess of their maximum Hit Points as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a victim that's already drained doesn't restore any Hit Points to the baobhan sith but increases the victim's drained value by 1. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires 10 minutes, a successful DC 20 [[Medicine]] check, and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1.</span>
