This requires an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]], and the everburning mammoth regains 15 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points.

It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.</span>
