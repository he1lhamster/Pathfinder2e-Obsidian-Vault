# Hunter Wight

Dangers deep in the wilderness claim the life some lone scout or hunter. When they arise as wights, they renew their hunt with equal vigor, but all the living are now their prey. Hunter wights prefer to seek strategic ground, frequently taking residence atop hills or within abandoned watchtowers and keeps.

###  Bone Arrowheads

A hunter wight snaps bits of their ribs into arrowheads to drain life from a distance. These bones slowly regenerate over time.
