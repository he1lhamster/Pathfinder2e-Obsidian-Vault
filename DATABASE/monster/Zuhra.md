# Zuhra

Zuhras, the genies of the elemental [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Metal|Plane of Metal]], are bold and imposing, fond of being the center of attention and drawing a crowd with flashy performances, displays of skill, and tales of their personal victories. Despite their large personalities, their long-term relationships tend to be cool and somewhat distant; zuhras often make alliances but rarely form friendships, and the trust required for deeper relationships is rarer still. The few mortals who've gotten to know a zuhra often describe them as bombastic but emotionally aloof.
 Since the reconnection with other planes, zuhras have sought out and formed bonds with other genies. They find their jabali cousins to be capable smithing partners, if a bit staid and dull. Zuhras rarely pay non-genie elementals any more than a passing glance, finding even the intelligent ones uninteresting to communicate with or hard to relate to.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Conductive Redirection <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (arcane, concentrate, electricity) **Trigger** The zuhra is hit by an attack, spell, or effect that deals electricity damage; **Effect** The zuhra conducts the electricity through their body, taking damage as normal, and redirecting a bolt at one target within 30 feet that they can see. The zuhra makes a ranged attack roll with a +20 modifier against the target's AC. On a hit or critical hit, the target takes electricity damage equal to the full damage of the triggering effect.</span>

###  Distant Thunder

Zuhras favor music over all other arts. Given their long isolation, however, their preferences are quite unlike those of other genies or most musicians of the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Universe]]. They value volume, intensity, and discordant combinations of sounds. Lead vocal parts incorporate droning and screams, often with a chorus providing a melodic counterpoint.

###  Skimming Along

Zuhras achieve flight by using magnetism to lift their own bodies into the air. As this grows more difficult the higher they go, many zuhras' preferred method of movement isn't walking or flying, but gliding along the smooth surfaces of their home plane much the way mortals cross ice on skates, with only a thin layer of electromagnetism between them and the ground.
