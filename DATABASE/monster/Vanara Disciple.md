# Vanara Disciple

Vanara culture prizes order and discipline, leading to many vanaras studying monastic practices. They also value compassion, kindness, and community, whether that community is their own or one they're visiting. Most vanaras are quick to offer aid to those in distress and rarely hesitate in the face of evil, no matter the danger it presents. The leaders of vanara villages tend to be religious figures, or occasionally others possessing similar values and experience. Vanaras venerate [[DATABASE/deity/Ragdya|Ragdya]], the Sage of the Mountain, who encourages seeking enlightenment through worldly action and sees the virtues of pranks and humor.
