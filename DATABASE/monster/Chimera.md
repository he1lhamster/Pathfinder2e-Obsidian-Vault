# Chimera

The chimera is the archetypal example of an unnatural monster made up of a monstrous mix of wildly different component creatures: in this case, a lion, a dragon, and a goat. Wild, hateful, and hungry, it tries to eat any creature it sees, but sometimes a strong-willed master is able to compel a chimera to serve as a guardian or even a mount.

The chimera can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.

###  Kobold Adoration

Some kobold groups are fond of chimera guardians or pets, but few kobolds have the bravery or resources to keep a chimera happy for long. While chimeras are often pressed into service by more intelligent creatures, it’s also not unheard of for a chimera to keep a herd of unintelligent animals—lions, goats, or even serpents—as both companions and food supply.
