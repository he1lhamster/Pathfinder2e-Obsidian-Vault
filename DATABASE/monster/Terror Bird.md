# Terror Bird

Common terror birds, also known as axe beaks, are notable hunters. On their own, they use their great speed to catch prey unawares. In a flock, they can swarm larger beasts like aurochs and take them down with overwhelming numbers.

###  Diatryma

These smaller kin of terror birds sport dark feathers and stand around 6 to 7 feet tall—smaller than terror birds, but no less ferocious. Diatrymas are mostly found in drier regions, where their small, orange beaks have earned them the nickname “dagger beaks.” Diatrymas are 1st-level creatures akin to terror birds with the weak adjustment.
