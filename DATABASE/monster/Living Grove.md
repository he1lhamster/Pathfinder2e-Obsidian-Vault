# Living Grove

A living grove is a singular connected entity, with dozens of genetically identical trunks united within the same root system. At rest, a living grove resembles nothing so much as a small arboretum of birch and aspen trees, though oak and redwood varieties that are significantly larger and tougher exist as well.

**Defensive Camouflage** The living grove can [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] in natural environments even if it doesn't have cover. While Hiding, its root system is safely covered in dirt, granting the grove a +3 status bonus to AC. A critical hit cracks this protective layer of earth to disperse in the wind, ending the effect.

###  Slumbering Giants

Long before mortal civilization, living groves made their way to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Universe]], buried their roots deep for safety, and fell dormant. A handful of these ancient elementals survive to this day, numbering among the oldest non-immortal entities yet living on the plane. Their long separation from the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]] has sent most into a deep hibernation, but an infusion of planar energy or powerful primal magic could potentially wake them up.
