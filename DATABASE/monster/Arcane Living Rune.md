###  Camouflage

Living runes are aware of the value of surprise attacks. They often hide themselves amongst other inscriptions or glyphs, observing foes for a time before striking, though clever adventurers who Investigate the inscriptions might notice the presence of the living rune. Living runes are also fond of setting up [[Glyph of Warding]] as decoys and dummies.
