# Straugh

When skirmishes break out between tunneling [[Ghoul]] and creatures that dwell beneath the surface of Golarion, there's a chance that ghoul fever could infect such animals, producing strange new variants of ghoul beasts. However, letting the natural corruption run its course sometimes results in unsatisfying monsters, so some necromancers speed the process. This is the situation that led to the creation of the first straugh. A priest of [[Kabriri]] made the monstrosity to defend a claimed cemetery from another sect of ghouls who were preying upon the interred bodies. In some places, ghouls use straughs to tunnel into rival warrens or highly fortified mausoleums.

The straugh releases a disgusting cloud of gas and decaying detritus in a 15-foot cone; any creature within the area must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [[Sickened]]. On a critical failure, the creature also takes a –5 foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.

###  Hungry Beasts

Some creatures are especially engineered by foul necromancers to have traits like that of ghouls. [[Skaveling]] and straughs are examples of this. As a GM you can create your own ghoul variants if you wish. _Pathfinder Book of the Dead_ (see Undead Adjustments) provides advice on how to accomplish this on the fly with nearly any creature, though some make more sense than others. The best creatures to receive the ghoul treatment are those normally associated with being ravenous and dangerous. When you want a creature that is significantly more powerful than the base creature, it's sometimes best to be your own necromancer and design a ghoul-like undead beast from the ground up to reflect their increased threat level.
