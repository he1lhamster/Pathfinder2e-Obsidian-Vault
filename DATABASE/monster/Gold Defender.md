**HP** 190; **Immunities** bleed, death effects, disease, [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]], fire, healing, magic, mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], poison, [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]]; **Resistances** physical 15 (except [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Weapon|adamantine]])
<span class="in-box-ability">**Death Throes** When the gold defender is destroyed, it melts into worthless slag. As it melts, it releases a 10-foot radius cloud of fumes and a 10-foot radius puddle of molten metal. Creatures that breathe fumes are exposed to gold defender poison. Creatures that move through the puddle take 10d6 fire damage. The fumes dissipate after 1 round and the puddle cools after 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Golem Antimagic** harmed by cold (6d10, 2d8 from areas and [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]]); healed by fire (area 2d8 HP); [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] by acid</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Malleable Shape** The gold defender's body is made from soft gold, which is particularly pliable. If the gold defender is critically hit with an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, the attack partially bends and reshapes the gold defender. The gold defender becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 2]] until it spends an Interact action to bend itself back into shape.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vulnerable to _Telekinetic Haul_** Casting [[DATABASE/spell/Telekinetic Haul|telekinetic haul]] on the gold defender squeezes its form, compressing it into a smaller and much more awkward shape. The gold defender becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 3]] and can't use Light Reflection. The gold defender must take a 1-minute activity, which has the manipulate trait, to restore its shape, removing the clumsy condition and restoring its Light Reflection.</span>

**Speed** 20 feet
<span class="in-box-ability">**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> fist +28 [+23/+18] (magical, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d10+12 bludgeoning</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Gold Defender Poison** (poison) Any [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]] value from this poison is reduced by 1 every hour; **Saving Throw** DC 33 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 4 rounds; **Stage 1** 2d6 poison and drained 1 (1 round); **Stage 2** 4d6 poison and drained 2 (1 round); **Stage 3** 8d6 poison and drained 3 (1 round).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Inexorable March** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The gold defender Strides up to its Speed, pushing back each creature whose space it moves into and damaging them if they try to stop its movement. A creature can attempt to bar the way by succeeding at a DC 37 Fortitude save. On a critical success, the resisting creature takes no damage; otherwise, it is damaged as if hit by the defender's fist Strike.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Light Reflection** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (primal, evocation) **Requirements** The gold defender is not in darkness; **Effect** The gold defender reshapes its skin into a reflective surface that magnifies ambient light into a precise beam that burns all creatures in a 30-foot cone, dealing 14d6 fire damage (DC 31 Reflex save if the gold defender is in dim light, DC 33 Reflex save if it's in bright light). It can't use Light Reflection again for 1d4 rounds.
 **Critical Success** The creature takes no damage. 
**Success** The creature takes half damage. 
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and catches fire, taking 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]]. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the persistent fire damage is 5d6.</span>
