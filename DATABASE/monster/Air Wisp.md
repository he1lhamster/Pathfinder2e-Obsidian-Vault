<span class="in-box-ability">**Resonance** (aura, air) 30 feet. All wisps vibrate at a frequency attuned to their element, resonating with and empowering all creatures and effects sharing that trait.

These temporary Hit Points last 1 hour.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> A wisp that uses this reaction is permanently destroyed, and it can be restored only by a [[Wish]] spell or similarly powerful effect. If an ability would prevent the wisp's destruction (for instance, if the wisp is summoned and would merely be dismissed), Accord Essence has no effect.</span>
