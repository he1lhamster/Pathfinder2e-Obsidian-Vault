<span class="in-box-ability">**Confusing Display** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate, emotion, enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental, occult, visual) The augnagar's writhing limbs and flesh seethe and squirm in a disorienting and unsettling manner. Creatures in a 30-foot emanation must attempt a DC 30 Will save, after which they are temporarily immune to further Confusing Displays for 1 minute. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature is [[Stupefied]] for 1 round. 
**Failure** The creature is stupefied 1 and [[Confused]] for 1 minute. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature can't attempt a flat check to recover from confusion whenever it takes damage from an attack or spell.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Inhale Vitality** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (necromancy, occult) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The augnagar inhales sharply, drawing life force out of creatures in a 50-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 12d6 negative damage (DC 30 basic Fortitude save, and the creature is [[Fatigued]] on a failure). The augnagar becomes [[Quickened]] for 1 round on its next turn, and it can use the extra action only to Stride or Strike.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rotting Curse** (curse, disease, necromancy, occult) **Saving Throw** DC 30 Fortitude; **Stage 1** [[Drained]] (1 day); **Stage 2** drained 2 and the creature displays hideous, festering wounds exuding a horrific stench. Any creature within 30 feet of the victim must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [[Sickened]] (plus [[Slowed]] on a critical failure, for as long as it's sickened). While within the aura, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute. The victim of the disease doesn't roll a save, but takes the failure effects automatically and can't reduce its sickened value below 1 (1 day).</span>
