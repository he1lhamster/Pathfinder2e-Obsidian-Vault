description: "A crafty [[DATABASE/monster/Gug|gug]] with a command of necromantic\
  \ powers, Helg has turned the tables on the xulgath slavers and now indirectly commands\
  \ their forces through the animated corpse of their murdered leader, Arskuva. <br/><br/>\
  \ While most humans have difficulty telling one gug from another, Helg Eats-the-Eaters\
  \ is fairly distinctive. She is slimmer than most of her kind, though just as tall.\
  \ She always wears a large religious symbol of Bokrug around her neck, depicting\
  \ a bearded lizard with a curled tail.<br/><br/> Helg's primary devotion in life\
  \ is to serve Bokrug. She began dreaming of the Water Lizard as a whelp, and it\
  \ took her years to understand the visions that she was receiving. She finally found\
  \ a gug savant who could explain her visions to her and teach her more about Bokrug's\
  \ faith, as well as certain necromantic magic. One night after the savant had died\
  \ and left Helg on her own again, she began dreaming of an undersea cavern with\
  \ a large and incredibly lifelike statue of her patron, which turned to look at\
  \ her and beckoned. When she awoke, Helg knew that she had to find that statue,\
  \ and she left her home in the Darklands. Through her ongoing dreams, she triangulated\
  \ the location of the old and forgotten shrine to the caves beneath the town of\
  \ Willowside. She felt compelled to take it to a deeper, safer place beneath the\
  \ earth.<br/><br/> As Helg approached the shrine from her dreams, she noticed xulgath\
  \ troops gathering nearby in the forest, near an old tower. Knowing that such creatures\
  \ were rare on the surface, especially in such numbers, Helg investigated. The xulgaths'\
  \ gug slaves proved to be Helg's easiest way into the camp: no one, not even the\
  \ other browbeaten gugs, noticed or questioned an extra slave. While eavesdropping\
  \ on the xulgaths' leader, Arskuva, Helg learned that the xulgaths weren't interested\
  \ in Willowside at all, but in the aeon tower just outside of town. She decided\
  \ to take matters into her own claws.<br/><br/> Helg murdered the unsuspecting Arskuva\
  \ and animated her body, and now commands the xulgath army by proxy. Yet Helg understands\
  \ that her surreptitious command is precarious\u2014a dramatic change to the xulgaths'\

  \ the Bokrug statue and relocating it to someplace safer and deeper than its current\
  \ shrine. First, although the townspeople of Willowside are individually weak, even\
  \ compared to a xulgath (much less a gug), surface-dwellers have a distressing tendency\
  \ to defend one another and seek help from other communities. Helg needed to isolate\
  \ Willowside, so she has slowly maneuvered the xulgaths into besieging the town.\
  \ Bored with the dull work of camping near a sealed tower, the xulgaths are eager\
  \ for action.<br/><br/> Second, Helg needs a way to transport the statue in secret,\

# Helg Eats-The-Eaters

A crafty [[Gug]] with a command of necromantic powers, Helg has turned the tables on the xulgath slavers and now indirectly commands their forces through the animated corpse of their murdered leader, Arskuva. 
 While most humans have difficulty telling one gug from another, Helg Eats-the-Eaters is fairly distinctive. She is slimmer than most of her kind, though just as tall. She always wears a large religious symbol of Bokrug around her neck, depicting a bearded lizard with a curled tail.
 Helg's primary devotion in life is to serve Bokrug. She began dreaming of the Water Lizard as a whelp, and it took her years to understand the visions that she was receiving. She finally found a gug savant who could explain her visions to her and teach her more about Bokrug's faith, as well as certain necromantic magic. One night after the savant had died and left Helg on her own again, she began dreaming of an undersea cavern with a large and incredibly lifelike statue of her patron, which turned to look at her and beckoned. When she awoke, Helg knew that she had to find that statue, and she left her home in the Darklands. Through her ongoing dreams, she triangulated the location of the old and forgotten shrine to the caves beneath the town of Willowside. She felt compelled to take it to a deeper, safer place beneath the earth.
 As Helg approached the shrine from her dreams, she noticed xulgath troops gathering nearby in the forest, near an old tower. Knowing that such creatures were rare on the surface, especially in such numbers, Helg investigated. The xulgaths' gug slaves proved to be Helg's easiest way into the camp: no one, not even the other browbeaten gugs, noticed or questioned an extra slave. While eavesdropping on the xulgaths' leader, Arskuva, Helg learned that the xulgaths weren't interested in Willowside at all, but in the aeon tower just outside of town. She decided to take matters into her own claws.
 Helg murdered the unsuspecting Arskuva and animated her body, and now commands the xulgath army by proxy. Yet Helg understands that her surreptitious command is precarious—a dramatic change to the xulgaths' mission might raise suspicions.
 Helg faces two obstacles in recovering the Bokrug statue and relocating it to someplace safer and deeper than its current shrine. First, although the townspeople of Willowside are individually weak, even compared to a xulgath (much less a gug), surface-dwellers have a distressing tendency to defend one another and seek help from other communities. Helg needed to isolate Willowside, so she has slowly maneuvered the xulgaths into besieging the town. Bored with the dull work of camping near a sealed tower, the xulgaths are eager for action.
 Second, Helg needs a way to transport the statue in secret, as the Zevgavizeb-worshipping xulgaths aren't likely to approve of a statue to another god in their midst. Helg hit upon the idea of a mobile siege tower, which could move in secret amid the protection of a xulgath army unlikely to question a construction useful in their assault on the aeon tower. Helg drafted the plans and had Arskuva present them. Fortunately, the xulgaths bought her ruse and now work diligently to complete the three-story siege engine.
 When the tower is complete, Helg will put the rest of her plan into motion. She'll recommend testing the siege tower against Willowside, and in the confusion, she'll slip into the sea caves, shrink the statue to a manageable size with her [[Statuette]] ritual, and hide it in the siege tower before it regains its normal mass. Arskuva will then receive further instructions to return to the Darklands with their siege tower (and, along with it, Helg's precious statue).
 Helg generally hides in the shadows rather than confront her enemies directly, preferring deceit and subtlety even when directness might be more effective. Helg is thus happy using Arskuva to command the army rather than openly attempting to take control.

## Campaign Role

The heroes might see Helg as merely another monster to overcome, but they can also negotiate with her. Helg's driving goal is to acquire the statue of Bokrug from the shrine. While she has no compunction about attacking Willowside, its destruction isn't necessary to her plans, so she's willing to call off the xulgath siege in exchange for the statue. She sees no useful purpose in making an enemy of the heroes if she doesn't have to. Helg doesn't have a further role to play in this adventure path, but heroes who get into trouble in the Darklands in _Pathfinder Adventure Path #155: Lord of the Black Sands_ might need to visit the closest thing to a friendly face they have in the region.
