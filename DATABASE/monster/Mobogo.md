# Mobogo

Mobogos are massive, swamp-dwelling monstrosities that combine the worst aspects of giant toads and evil dragons. Lazy, cruel, and greedy, these vile creatures make their lairs in the most ancient and primordial swamps. The [[Boggard]] who call such places home worship mobogos as living demigods, regularly bringing sacrifices of food and valuables lest they become the next victims of the mobogos' boundless appetites.

The creature isn't [[Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the mobogo's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with a Strike against AC 27 that deals at least 10 slashing damage. This deals no damage to the mobogo but prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes 1 round. The mobogo can move without ending the Grab as long as the creature remains within the tongue's reach.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tongue Reposition** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The mobogo attempts to move a creature grabbed by its tongue. The mobogo rolls an [[Athletics]] check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the mobogo moves the creature into any space within the tongue's reach. If it wishes, the mobogo can transfer the grabbed creature to its jaws.</span>

###  Children of Gogunta

The [[Boggard]] of Golarion believe mobogos to have hatched from the first clutch of eggs laid by their demon goddess [[Gogunta]], following her awakening at the dawn of creation. The boggards, hatched millennia later from the second clutch, have been charged with serving and aiding their elder siblings in keeping her sacred swamplands untainted by the presence of outsiders.
