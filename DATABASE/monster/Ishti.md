<span class="in-box-ability">**Change Shape** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The lamia matriarch can take on the appearance of a Medium humanoid. This doesn't change their Speed or their attack and damage modifiers with their Strikes, but it does prevent them from using their cursed touch. Each lamia matriarch has a fixed humanoid form—they cannot adopt a different appearance each time they use this ability, and the appearance resembles that of their upper torso when in their true form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Matriarch's Caress** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (curse, enchantment, mental, occult) The lamia touches a creature, who must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or become [[Stupefied]] (stupefied 2 if critically failed). If the target fails additional saves against this ability, the condition value increases by 1 if failed or 2 if critically failed (to a maximum of stupefied 4). This condition value decreases by 1 every 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Poison Weapon** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate) Ishti applies a poison to a piercing or slashing weapon of her choice.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Quick Dervish Strike** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The lamia matriarch makes a dagger attack against each enemy within reach. Each attack counts toward their multiple attack penalty, but the penalty does not increase until after all the attacks. The first enemy she damages is subject to matriarch's caress.</span>
