A swirling vortex of reflected color and light shimmers around the crystal dragon. Creatures in this aura's emanation are [[Dazzled]]. Each creature that ends its turn in the emanation must succeed at a DC 37 Will saving throw or be [[Stunned]] (or stunned 3 on a critical failure). Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is temporarily immune to the stunning effect for 1 minute. The crystal dragon can turn this aura on or off using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and it can choose not to affect allies.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Reflect Spell <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Vehanezhad is targeted by a ranged spell attack roll** **Effect** Vehanezhad adjusts a wing and gains a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, the spell reflects at the caster, who must roll a second ranged spell attack roll against their own AC to determine if the spell hits them instead.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Twisting Tail <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature within reach of the dragon's tail uses a move action or leaves a square during a move action it's using** **Effect** The dragon makes a tail Strike at the creature with a –2 penalty.

A creature who takes damage from this breath weapon is exposed to crystal corruption.

The creature must attempt a DC 40 Fortitude save.
 **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
 **Success** The target is [[Slowed]] for 1 round as portions of its flesh turn crystalline.
 **Failure** The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition value increases by 1 (or by 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition value by 1. A creature unable to act due to the slowed condition from Crystallize Flesh is [[Petrified]] permanently, transforming into a crystalline statue. The effect ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Draconic Frenzy** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Vehanezhad makes two claw Strikes and one tail Strike in any order.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Draconic Momentum** Vehanezhad recharges her Breath Weapon whenever she critically hits with a Strike.</span>
