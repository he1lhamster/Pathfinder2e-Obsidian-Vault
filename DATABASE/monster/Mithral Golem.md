# Mithral Golem

Mithral golems are gorgeously crafted, silvery humanoids made from colossal amounts of the purest [[DATABASE/equipment/Mithral|mithral]]. While massive in construction, they possess amazing speed and grace through literal fluidity. Unpredictable and flexible, they can melt into liquid form and reform into a solid shape in mere seconds, allowing them to shape their limbs into sharp spikes or heavy fists as needed.

###  Creative Fluidity

The mithral golem's fluid form offers endless possibilities for inventive owners looking to deploy these constructs within their trap-filled domains. The golem can be instructed to remain in its liquid phase until a specific triggering event, appearing as a pool or font filled with quicksilver, or covering columns or statues. Truly fiendish minds might store them in hidden reservoirs hooked to pumps and nozzles, ready to spray a dangerous foe onto unsuspecting adventurers
