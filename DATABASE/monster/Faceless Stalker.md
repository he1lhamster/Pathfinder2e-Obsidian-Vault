# Faceless Stalker (Ugothol)

Among the subtler of the alghollthu creations were the ugothols—also known as faceless stalkers. These twisted beings used shapeshifting to infiltrate settlements and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders, causing unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their aquatic masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today, most faceless stalkers—like the less dangerous ulat-kinis—pursue programmed goals without the guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live as close to the sea coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures themselves. Most dwell in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers of coastal towns.
 By instinct, faceless stalkers seek to sow discord. They replace leaders in humanoid societies, then guide infiltrated settlements down paths of destruction. Among humanoids who have wicked tendencies, a faceless stalker can become a prominent trailblazer, leading a group to new heights of depravity and violence. Inevitably, however, faceless stalker infiltrators lead their followers to ruin. The ugothol eventually moves on—either because its true nature is about to be discovered, or because it has despoiled or devastated all local resources.
 An ugothol gains nourishment only through its long, bloodsucking tongue. Their prey bear distinctive triple puncture wounds near major arteries. Corpses bearing such marks are typically the first clues found to uncover a faceless stalker’s presence, though sometimes they are overlooked as marks belonging to a vampire or chupacabra.
