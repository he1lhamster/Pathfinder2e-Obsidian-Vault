**Universal Language** Anything spoken by the Shadow Prince is perceived by the listener in its native language.
**Urban Legend** A brainchild is sustained only by the reputation that precedes them. Mindless creatures are immune to a brainchild and can't perceive them. The brainchild's size, features, and items, as well as the appearance of their attacks, match what the foes perceiving them expect. If foes expect to see different things, the brainchild chooses which to manifest. If any creature that can perceive the brainchild believes the brainchild has one of the abilities below, the brainchild has that ability. A creature can [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] or [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] (against the brainchild's [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] DC) to attempt to disbelieve an individual ability. If at any point no creature perceiving the brainchild believes in the ability, the brainchild loses that ability immediately. If foes expect different particulars, such as one believing the brainchild is immune to fire and another believing they're immune to divinations, the brainchild chooses one to have.
