# Tomb Giant

Masters of mausoleums and keepers of crypts, the dread creatures called tomb giants are anathema to all living beings, but especially so to other types of giants. Long ago, so the legends say, tomb giants sold their souls in exchange for unfathomable necromantic powers. With whom they made this foul bargain remains a mystery—if the rumors hold any truth at all. Still, tomb giants' power over undeath remains undeniable, and nearly all of them embrace a fervent passion for necromancy.
 Tomb giants construct massive gothic settlements in haunted valleys and on forsaken hillsides, far enough away from the societies of smaller people that they remain relatively undisturbed, but close enough that they can raid the graveyards of nearby villages with impunity.
 Elder tomb giants—those who have animated countless hordes of humanoid [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Zombie|zombies]] and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Skeleton|skeletons]] and yearn for even greater challenges—enjoy the thrill of subduing, slaying, and reanimating their fellow giants. [[DATABASE/monster/Taiga Giant|Taiga giants]] in particular are choice prey to an experienced tomb giant, as their larger cousins make formidable undead guardians and warriors.
 A tomb giant views its mortal life as only one part of its existence. After death, most tomb giants are themselves reanimated as undead, who then continue to practice their necromantic arts.

The tomb giant touches a creature that died in the past 24 hours, infusing its flesh and bone with negative energy. Once during the next hour, the tomb giant can spend a single action (from any distance) to release this negative energy from the corpse in an explosion that deals 10d8 negative energy in a 15-foot burst (DC 32 basic Fortitude save); if not released before the end of the hour, the energy dissipates harmlessly. The tomb giant can't use Font of Death while a previous corpse remains infused.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Throw Rock|Throw Rock]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> </span>

###  Generals of the Underworld

The most powerful tomb giants amass literal armies of undead minions to serve them and wage wars on their behalf. Woe to any sleepy hamlet caught in the crossfire of two warring tomb giants, whose campaigns of doom can transform an idyllic vale into a forsaken boneyard overnight.
