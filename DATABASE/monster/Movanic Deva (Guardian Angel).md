# Movanic Deva (Guardian Angel)

Movanic devas are stewards of the flow of good creatures' souls through the cycle of life and death, from the point a creature is born to the day it dies. These angels arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share a specific connection with a creature's vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas are most concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal lives, so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva leaves its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of their stewardship over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within animals a level of sapience to allow them to become kindly and benevolent as well, thus increasing the flow of goodness into the afterlife. They also spend time patrolling the [[DATABASE/plane/Positive Energy Plane|Positive Energy Plane]] and [[DATABASE/plane/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], seeking to contain significant threats to life.

###  The Gift of Sapience

When a movanic deva awakens an animal, the animal becomes neutral good and is well-disposed toward the deva, but the deva understands that free will is an important part of life. While the deva provides enough support and guidance to the animal to help it adjust to its newly sapient world view, not all animals awakened in this way remain on the path of good.
