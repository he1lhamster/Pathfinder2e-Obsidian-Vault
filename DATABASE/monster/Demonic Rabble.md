# Demonic Rabble

The typical demon throng consists of a chaotic mix of less powerful demons— typically [[DATABASE/monster/Abrikandilu (Wrecker Demon)|abrikandilus]], [[DATABASE/monster/Dretch (Sloth Demon)|dretches]], and [[DATABASE/monster/Quasit|quasits]], with a few [[DATABASE/monster/Brimorak (Arson Demon)|brimoraks]], [[DATABASE/monster/Babau (Blood Demon)|babaus]] or other, more powerful demons swept up in the mayhem. This tangled mess of different creatures makes coordinated tactics untenable but, while individual demons in the throng might not be able to fully utilize their abilities, the throng itself makes up for these deficiencies with dangerous options of its own.
