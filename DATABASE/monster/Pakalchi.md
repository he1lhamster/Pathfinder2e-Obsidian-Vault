# Pakalchi

Pakalchis strive to intensify their preys' inherent insecurity over personal and emotional bonds, playing on the threat of those relationships falling into ruin. These sahkils are among the most manipulative of their kind, pulling strings both literal and figurative on their victims over stretched-out periods of time, exhilarating in the despair and fear for as long as possible.

**Easy to Call** A sahkil's level is considered 2 lower for the purpose of being conjured by the [[Planar Binding]] ritual (and potentially other rituals, at the GM's discretion), but it is always free to attack or leave instead of negotiate unless the primary caster's check is a critical success.
