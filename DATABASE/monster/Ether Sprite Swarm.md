# Ether Sprite Swarm

One ether sprite is quite enough for most, and can be tiresome for even the fey. When a group of them get together, it's outright bedlam.

###  Sprite Collections

Ether sprites have a reputation for being thieves. In truth, they're generally curious about the world and simply have a tendency to walk away with objects that don't belong to them, not understanding the concept of ownership. As a result, ether sprites tend to have small interesting objects in their possession, such as talismans or gemstones.
