# Clockwork Puppeteer

Clockwork puppeteers are grim constructs capable of controlling corpses like puppets. They typically stand 12 feet tall and have spindly legs and long arms ending with scalpel-like claws. Dozens of metallic strings, composed of interlocking clockwork links, hang from their wrists.

The puppeteer can use up to six strings at a time. It can release any creature grabbed by a string as a free action. Each string has AC 30, and its [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC is 32.

###  Clockwork Free Will

Although mindless, clockwork puppeteers display an unusual ability to reason and make choices independently. This appearance of free will is, however, merely an illusion. In truth, a puppeteer's clockwork “brain” is so complex it bears a powerful semblance of agency. Creating these brains is a taxing and expensive endeavor, which is why clockwork puppeteers are among the rarest kinds of clockwork.
