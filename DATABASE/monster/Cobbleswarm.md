###  Cobble Mite Pets

Characters looking to keep a cobble mite as a pet can usually buy one in a large city for 1 gp. Cobble mites are content as pets if they're pampered and well-fed. Searching for one in the wild takes careful hunting and risks finding cobble mites laired together in a cobbleswarm. A character with a familiar can choose a cobble mite, which must have the burrower familiar ability.
