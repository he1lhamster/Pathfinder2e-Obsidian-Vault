description: 'Nimble spirit guides are small and discreet, using their diminutive
  size and natural agility to dart from hiding place to hiding place. They tend to
  be much shyer than other spirit guides, at least initially, preferring to watch
  nearby mortals from a distance before deciding whether to trust them. When their
  trust is so earned, nimble spirit guides are often playful and contagiously exuberant.
  These spirit guides can often be found entertaining lost children with antics until
  they are rescued or freeing prisoners by stealing keys and picking locks.<br/><br/>

# Nimble Guide

Nimble spirit guides are small and discreet, using their diminutive size and natural agility to dart from hiding place to hiding place. They tend to be much shyer than other spirit guides, at least initially, preferring to watch nearby mortals from a distance before deciding whether to trust them. When their trust is so earned, nimble spirit guides are often playful and contagiously exuberant. These spirit guides can often be found entertaining lost children with antics until they are rescued or freeing prisoners by stealing keys and picking locks.
 The green monkey is a nimble spirit guide who takes the appearance of a tiny primate with green fur that, on closer inspection, turns out to be fine blades of grass.
