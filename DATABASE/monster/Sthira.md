# Sthira

The Wall of Heaven claims many intrepid climbers. Some such travelers come seeking fortune. Others seek enlightenment. Many, however, find only an icy death. With no means for a proper burial, many of these unfortunate souls remain abandoned to the ice, their bodies becoming macabre guideposts along mountain trails.
 Through means unknown, the most willful of these frozen travelers reanimate to seek vengeance upon the living for their denied burial. Such creatures, called sthiras, are composed of multiple bodies or body parts frozen together into one horrific monstrosity.

###  Other Sthiras

Mountaineer stories warn of sthiras that have incorporated the bodies of powerful non-humanoids and have even more terrifying abilities as a result, ranging from the capacity to cast spells, exhale gouts of ice, or even fly.
