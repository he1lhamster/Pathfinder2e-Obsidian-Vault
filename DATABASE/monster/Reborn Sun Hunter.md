<span class="in-box-ability">**Burning Sacrifice** (divine, evocation, fire) When the sun hunter is destroyed, they explode in a blast of flame that deals 6d6 fire damage in a 10-foot emanation (DC 27 basic Reflex save). Creatures that critically fail their saves are marked with [[DATABASE/deity/Walkena|Walkena's]] religious symbol on a visible area of their body, which remains for 1 day. This mark allows Walkena to treat the creature as if he knew the creature's identity but not having met them for the purposes of [[DATABASE/spell/Scrying|scrying]], lowering the spell's DC by 2.

The sun hunter attempts a Perception check against that creature's Deception DC or Will DC, whichever is higher. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute. 
**Critical Success** The sun hunter reads the target like a book. The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against the sun hunter's attacks until the end of the sun hunter's next turn. 
**Success** The sun hunter notices a brief opening. The target is flat-footed against the sun hunter's attacks until the end of the sun hunter's turn. 
**Failure** The target is unaffected. 
**Critical Failure** The sun hunter's intense focus opens them up to other attacks. The target is unaffected, and the sun hunter is flat-footed until the start of their next turn.</span>
