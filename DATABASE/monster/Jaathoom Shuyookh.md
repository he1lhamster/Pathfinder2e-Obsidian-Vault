# Jaathoom Shuyookh

Exalted jaathoom shuyookhs are ostentatious purveyors of dreams and nightmares. They can remain invisible like any jaathoom, but prefer to make themselves visible to better communicate and express their individuality through bright fabrics, expensive jewels, and flashy displays of excess.
**Recall Knowledge - Elemental ([[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]])**: DC 32
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 30

The shuyookh's visions of the subject's future inform how it interprets the wish.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ominous Dreams** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (mental, prediction) The jaathoom sends a prophetic dream into the mind of a sleeping creature within 60 feet. An unwilling creature can avoid the vision if it succeeds at a DC 32 Will save. The jaathoom chooses the dream's subject but not its exact events. The target sees a brief vision of its future related to that subject, with the effect of [[DATABASE/spell/Augury|augury]]. If the result is bad or mixed, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 2]] and doesn't start to recover from being frightened until it wakes.</span>
