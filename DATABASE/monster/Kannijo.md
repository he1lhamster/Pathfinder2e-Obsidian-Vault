**Breathsense** 60 feet (precise). A jiang-shi can't perceive living creatures beyond 5 feet except with their breathsense. A living creature within the listed range who holds its breath is invisible to the jiang-shi for as long as it hold its breath. To hold its breath in this way, a creature must have one hand free to fully plug its nose or cover its mouth. (Refer to Drowning and Suffocation for the full rules on holding breath.)

<span class="in-box-ability">**Jiang-Shi Vulnerabilities** All jiang-shi possess the following vulnerabilities.

* **Revulsion** A jiang-shi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or the sound of ringing handbells. A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring that item for 1 round (similar to [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raising a Shield]]). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).
* **Bitter Epiphany** A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a DC 25 Will save. They are then temporarily immune to bitter epiphany for 1 minute.<span class="in-box-ability"> **Critical Success** The jiang-shi is unaffected.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Success** The jiang-shi is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 round.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Critical Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 minute.</span>

</span><span class="in-box-ability">**One More Breath** (divine, necromancy, negative) Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point. Scattering at least 1 Bulk of glutinous rice or hen eggs on an unconscious jiang-shi destroys them permanently. If the jiang-shi was reduced to 0 HP by an attack from a weapon made of [[DATABASE/equipment/Darkwood|darkwood]], they're destroyed immediately</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Harrowed Fulu** Unlike the typical jiang-shi, Kannijo's warped fulu has been replaced by a card from the _Deck of Destiny_—a replacement that has largely gone unnoticed by the vampire. Kannijo is immune to spells cast from a magic item without expending a spell slot, such as from a [[DATABASE/equipment/Scroll|scroll]] or wand, and also gains the passive abilities granted from _[[DATABASE/equipment/The Snakebite|The Snakebite]]_ (but not its activation ability). A creature can [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]] _The Snakebite_ to remove it (DC 33). This immediately ends Kannijo's immunity to these effects, negates the card's passive effects, and removes Kannijo's [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing]]. Kannijo can no longer use _The Snakebite_ as its fulu, but can create a replacement warped fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Drain Qi** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, necromancy) **Requirements** A [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or willing creature is within Kannijo's reach; **Effect** The jiang-shi drains the victim's life energy, or qi, through their breath. This requires an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] and the jiang-shi regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1. If the victim has the ability to cast ki spells, it can spend 1 Focus Point to avoid becoming drained. This protects it only from the current attack, not from subsequent attempts to Drain Qi.
 A victim's drained condition value decreases by 1 every week. If the creature restricts their diet to glutinous rice for at least 1 day and spends 10 minutes dancing, jogging, or otherwise engaging in vigorous physical activity by succeeding at a DC 25 Athletics check, it reduces its drained condition by 1.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Manipulate the Green** Kannijo can use [[DATABASE/ritual/Inveigle|inveigle]] against plant creatures normally immune to mental effects, and can communicate with inveigled plant creatures as if under the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Speak with Plants|speak with plants]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rigor Mortis** The jiang-shi ignores difficult terrain and effects that would render it [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. A jiang-shi can't take the [[DATABASE/action/Drop Prone|Drop Prone]] action. When a jiang-shi [[DATABASE/action/Leap|Leap]], it doesn't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by move actions, such as [[DATABASE/action/Attack of Opportunity|Attacks of Opportunity]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spirit Naga Venom** (poison) **Saving Throw** DC 33 (34 against [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] targets); **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 2d6 poison damage and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] (1 round); **Stage 2** 3d6 poison damage and stupefied 2 (1 round)</span>
