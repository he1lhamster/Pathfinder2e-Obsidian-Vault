# Bright Walker

Those who encounter [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Caligni|calignis]] quickly learn that their deaths involve burning out instead of bleeding out. At times, this dramatic immolation is denied to a caligni, so they arise as a bright walker. Tied to caligni society, these creatures don't understand that their glow damages and repels living calignis. Despite their name, these undead don't walk; they instead float a few inches above the ground.

###  Bright Walker Formations

Most calignis assume that bright walkers arise at the whims of their malign and capricious demigods, the [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Owb|Forsaken]], but as the Forsaken are denied the souls of these undead, some other unknown force must be involved.
