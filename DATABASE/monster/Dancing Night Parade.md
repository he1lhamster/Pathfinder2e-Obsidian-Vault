Soiya!** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (emotion, mental, sonic) The night parade shouts a series of energetic call-and-responses, dealing 3d10 sonic damage and 4d6 mental damage to all creatures in a 10-foot burst within 20 feet (DC 41 basic Will save). If the troop is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Troop Movement** Whenever a troop Strides, it first [[Form Up]] as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to its Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wasshoi! Wasshoi!** <span class="action-icon">1</span> to <span class="action-icon">3</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The night parade dances with wild abandon, unintentionally striking nearby creatures. It deals damage to each adjacent creature (DC 41 basic Reflex save), and any creature that fails its save is pushed 10 feet in any direction as the night parade bounces it overhead. The damage depends on the number of actions.
