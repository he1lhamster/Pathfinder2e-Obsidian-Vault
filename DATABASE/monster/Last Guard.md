# Last Guard

Honor and broken oaths bind a last guard to a location they failed to defend in life. There they must keep watch until their duties are fulfilled or they are swayed by a compelling call to war, departing to march to battle.

**Battlefield Bound** Without a call to war, a last guard can stray only a short distance from the location they failed to defend, typically 120 feet. Some last guards are instead bound to a province, kingdom, or nation, rather than a specific location.

###  Armies of Legend

Last guards are formed under very specific and tragic circumstances. While this last guard is composed of elves armed with curve blades who failed to defend an elven settlement, last guards can arise from any culture. They most commonly form from the spirits of [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarves]], [[DATABASE/ancestry/Elf|elves]], [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|humans]], and [[DATABASE/ancestry/Orc|orcs]].
