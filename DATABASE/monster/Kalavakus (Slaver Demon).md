# Kalavakus (Slaver Demon)

Kalavakuses work as slavers in the Abyss, earning them the alternate moniker of “slaver demons”; these fiends round up captured victims and sell them to other fiends or unscrupulous mortals. Pleas for freedom or clemency fall on deaf ears, as slaver demons consider anyone they can catch and hold to be their rightful property and theirs to sell. Kalavakuses know more than just physical means of restraining slaves; they also know how to fetter a victim’s soul. The most successful slaver demons have vast slave-pits in the Abyss where they keep stables of imprisoned souls.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Enslave Soul** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (arcane, enchantment, mental) The demon enslaves the soul of a living creature within 60 feet. The target can attempt to resist this enslavement with a DC 29 Will save. A slaver demon can have only one living soul enslaved with this ability at a time, and no more than one slaver demon can enslave the same soul. If a slaver demon kills a creature whose soul it has enslaved, the demon regains 20 HP and the soul is consigned to an eternity of toil in the Abyss, adding to the slaver demon’s tally of souls and allowing the demon to enslave another.
 **Success** The target avoids being enslaved and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
 **Failure** The target is enslaved and is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] for 24 hours or until the slaver demon is slain, whichever comes first.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target also suffers the effects of a failed saving throw against [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]].</span>

###  Slaver's Sins

Slaver demons arise from the souls of mortals who worked as slavers, tyrants who encouraged human trafficking in their domains, or bureaucrats who turned a blind eye to illegal slaving activities.
