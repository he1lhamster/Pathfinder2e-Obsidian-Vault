# Hamatula (Barbed Devil)

Hamatulas are forged in Erebus to protect infernal vaults from those foolish enough to try to rob the archdevil [[Mammon]]. In case the vicious spines protruding from their bodies and ability to teleport weren't deadly enough, they are also clever wielders of warding glyphs. They are effective conjured guardians, though they resent being pulled away from their duties in [[Hell]]. Unlike most fiends, hamatulas are formed from several souls that lack any features distinctive enough to merit another role.

###  Hamatula Treasures

Perhaps because hamatulas exist to guard the riches of archdevils, infernal dukes, and queens of the night, they find themselves drawn to wealth. Though they despise summoners who pull them away from their assigned duties, hamatulas use their servitude as an opportunity to collect treasures and wealth that they can offer to their lords upon their return. Treasures that are painful or dangerous to handle are among their favorite prizes.
