# Tidehawk

Tidehawks, avian embodiments of the sea and rain, nest in deep underwater crevasses and glide among waves. They feed mostly on large sea life and rise above the surface during or in the aftermath of a rainstorm to bask in the fresh moisture of the air.
 Though tidehawks hail from the same mystical family as the legendary [[DATABASE/monster/Phoenix|phoenix]], the two rarely interact due to their different outlooks and elemental affiliations. Phoenixes see tidehawks as flighty and unreliable, while tidehawks view their fiery kin as self-righteous do-gooders who can't resist meddling in mortal affairs. Only particularly evil threats to natural environments can bring them together.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Self-Resurrection** (healing, necromancy, primal) When a tidehawk dies, it melts into a torrent of rainwater. If this rain falls into a body of water, such as an ocean or lake, the tidehawk returns to life fully healed 1d4 rounds later, as if subject to a 6th-level [[DATABASE/ritual/Resurrect|resurrect]] ritual. Self-resurrection happens only if there are remains to resurrect; for instance, a tidehawk killed by a [[DATABASE/spell/Disintegrate|disintegrate]] spell can't use this ability. A tidehawk that dies while above land must wait until its rainwater runs or seeps into an appropriate body of water to self-resurrect. A tidehawk can self-resurrect only once per year.</span>

The tidehawk gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of its next turn. If the tidehawk takes damage from a melee Strike while under this effect, this water armor explodes outward, dealing 4d8 bludgeoning damage (DC 32 basic Reflex save) to the attacking creature and ending the circumstance bonus to AC.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Typhoon Dive** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (evocation, primal, water) **Requirements** The tidehawk is [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Flying]]; **Effect** The tidehawk Flies up to its Speed, diving below the surface of deep water (such as a sea or ocean), causing a surging wave that deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 32 basic Reflex save) to each creature within a 60-foot emanation of where the tidehawk entered the water. The area becomes difficult terrain until the start of the tidehawk's next turn while the water surges and runs off.</span>

###  Wind and Wave

As dwellers of both water and air, tidehawks are viewed by many to be favored creatures of [[DATABASE/deity/Gozreh|Gozreh]], deity of wind and wave. Sailors argue whether a tidehawk sighting is a good or ill omen, as Gozreh can turn quickly from calm to wrathful. Tidehawks themselves rarely attack vessels on the water, but when they do, they leave few survivors.
