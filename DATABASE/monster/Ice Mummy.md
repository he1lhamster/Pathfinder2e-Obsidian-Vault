# Ice Mummy

The cold of high places coupled with strong winds and less oxygen creates an effect that can preserve bodies, mummifying them through natural processes. Many are created deliberately by cults, and a rare few voluntarily transform.

Living creatures are [[Frightened]] while in an ice mummy's great despair aura. They can't naturally recover from this fear while in the area but recover instantly once they leave it. When a creature first enters the area, it must succeed at a DC 24 Will save (after taking the penalty from being frightened) or be [[Paralyzed]] for 1d4 rounds. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</span>

###  Frozen in Time

Cults that prepare ice mummies first dehydrate the victim, then take them to the top of a mountain or glacier for a gruesome ritual. The mummy-to-be is stripped naked and rubbed down with oil and fat infused with herbs. The skin is preserved for magical talismans or clothing. If the victim rises to undeath, it receives its own skin to wear.
