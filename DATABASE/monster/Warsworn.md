On a failure, the target falls prone; if the target was airborne, it falls up to 120 feet, taking damage from the fall and landing prone if the descent brings it to the ground. On a critical failure, the target is also held under a pile of scrap (DC 37 to Escape).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Trample]]** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Huge or smaller, corpse wave, DC 37</span>

###  Warsworn

While uniquely terrible, war is not the only tragedy that can lead to mass deaths. Other forms of mass undead, similar to warsworn, can sometimes arise from causes such as famine or disaster. Flamesworn rise from large crowds killed by fire, while plagueborn rise when entire townships or even cities perish to disease.
