# Sigbin

Resembling hornless goats with extremely long tails, sigbins live in forests and prey on inhabitants of nearby humanoid villages. Sigbins drink the blood of their victims by biting into their shadows, rather than their flesh. This process typically leaves the victim so fatigued that they must lie down to rest, at which point the sigbin finishes the job by sinking their jaws into the person's chest and consuming their heart.
 Due to their nauseating smell, many sigbins hide among livestock and in other overwhelmingly odorous places. Sigbins have the ability to hide in plain sight simply by standing stock still, but this power works only against adults and elders; for whatever reason, children and young animals can see the invisible sigbins. Many believe this is because children are unsullied by the cruel ways of the world, and so their eyes are still innocent enough to spot the devious beasts. Unfortunately, most adults tend to ignore children's cries about the monsters, chalking up such claims to overactive imaginations or attention-seeking behavior, inadvertently allowing sigbins to continue their hunts uninterrupted.

The sigbin gains 15 temporary Hit Points that remain for 1 hour.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Unassuming Cloak** (illusion) A sigbin becomes almost imperceptible if it stands completely still. If the sigbin does not move or attack during its turn, it becomes [[Invisible]]. It remains invisible until it moves or takes a hostile action. Children and young creatures, like animal cubs, can see the sigbin normally, even while it's invisible.</span>

###  Sigbinans

Rumors hold that wicked individuals can capture [[Sigbin]] and use them for nefarious purposes. These monster hunters are known as sigbinans. Capturing a sigbin is a dangerous process that requires using a living person as bait and a large magical jar as the trap. Once they've captured a sigbin, the sigbinan can deploy their monster to terrorize others. In the jungles of Vudra, sigbinans have been known to capture sigbins to create magical amulets that, when donned, grant the wearer the sigbin's ability to drink blood through a person's shadow.
