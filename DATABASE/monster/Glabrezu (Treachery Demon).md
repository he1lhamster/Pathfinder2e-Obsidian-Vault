# Glabrezu (Treachery Demon)

Glabrezus are looming behemoths who revel in the act of twisting mortal desires into their ultimate ruin, betraying and manipulating as easily as they breathe. Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to fruition in the most destructive way possible, turning a wish or hope into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although the long-term repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example, a struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only to find that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted in the form of a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal’s needs.
 These massive demons have enormous pincers and a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting from their chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the souls of mortals engaged in treason and deception.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Truth Vulnerability** A glabrezu’s lies sustain them, and the truth can destroy them. Whenever a revelation effect counteracts or reveals the glabrezu’s illusions or the glabrezu fails a save against an effect that would prevent them from lying (such as [[DATABASE/spell/Zone of Truth|zone of truth]]), the demon takes 3d6 mental damage. They take this damage only once per effect, even if the effect reveals multiple illusions or prevents multiple lies.</span>
