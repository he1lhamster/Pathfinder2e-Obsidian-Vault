# Misery Siktempora

Creatures born of intense pain and suffering, the armless, six-legged misery siktemporas are some of the most numerous of their kind since misery is as ubiquitous an experience as living. They're also the most proactive of siktemporas, seeking to propagate the misery from which they spawn. They delight in opportunities to travel to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], where misery is so woefully prevalent and easily multiplied.
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 33
**Specific Lore**: DC 30
