# Harmona

Catching a glimpse of a harmona is said to be lucky. Flying quickly, observing and scouting new areas, these brightly colored avian fey are all but hidden to the eye. A soft buzz accompanies them, discernible only to creatures with particularly keen hearing.
 Intelligent and curious, these tiny fey birds freely roam the [[First World]], accompanying high-ranking fey creatures such as queens or their courts. In turn, companions who treat a harmona with respect for their knowledge and skill benefit from the harmona's aid in times of need.
 When these curious creatures find a natural gate between the planes, they glide through to explore and expand their knowledge. Those who find their way onto the [[Material Plane]] often choose to remain there in search of diverse and unusual places. This frequently leads them to the same locations that draw in curious adventurers. A harmona might befriend a non-fey adventurer as a companion, but they resent those who would treat them as pets and fight to the death to avoid capture.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Concussive Blow** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (evocation, primal, sonic) The harmona makes a beak Strike, channeling disruptive sound waves into the blow. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [[Stunned]] (stunned 2 on a critical failure). After this Strike, the harmona can Fly up to half their fly Speed.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Subsonic Pulse** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (evocation, primal) The harmona beats their wings rapidly towards the ground, creating a nearly inaudible rumble and sending a wave of shaking earth to overwhelm their enemies. Each creature in a 15-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 30 basic Fortitude save or take 6d6 sonic damage. A creature that fails its save is knocked [[Prone]] from the shaking ground.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ultrasonic Thrust** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (evocation, primal, sonic) The harmona beats their wings skyward, creating a spiraling vibration. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must attempt a DC 30 Reflex save as the high-frequency blast flings them up and away. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature is pushed 5 feet away and knocked off balance, becoming [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of their next turn. 
**Failure** Sonic waves fling the creature 15 feet back from the harmona. The creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall and lands [[Prone]]. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is flung 30 feet and takes double damage.</span>

###  Sweet Eats

Harmonas, like their mundane hummingbird counterparts, have rapid metabolisms and usually get most of their energy and wing power from flower nectar. Over time, they developed a taste for sweets such as cupcakes, cookies, pie, wine, elderflower cordial, and the like. They can be expensive companions to feed, but it is easiest to befriend a harmona by tempting their curiosity with a sweet it hasn't had the pleasure of trying yet.
