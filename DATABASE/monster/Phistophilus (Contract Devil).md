# Phistophilus (Contract Devil)

Contract devils are clerks, scribes, and bureaucrats of Hell rarely found outside the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential contracts, tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their worldly desires. If a target is desirable enough, a phistophilus can offer contracts for prices seemingly lesser than their soul all at once, though in this case, the devil carefully manipulates the price to drive the signatory toward the forces of law and evil, and therefore ultimately to Hell anyway. Contract devils are tall creatures with skin tones that range from bronze to crimson and large curving horns extending from their bodies, over which they often drape favored or important contracts.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Draft Contract** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (conjuration, divine, manipulate) The contract devil produces an infernal contract for a single living mortal. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, akin to the power of a [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] spell but fulfilled to the letter by the contract devil. To receive any of those benefits, the mortal must willingly sign its true name to the contract. At that point, the mortal’s soul is bound to the contract devil and Hell.
 While the contract is in effect, the victim can’t be restored to life except by [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] or similar magic. If the mortal is restored to life by those means, the contract devil knows which mortal came to life and can locate the creature or creatures who restored the mortal to life for 1 year, gaining the effects of a [[DATABASE/spell/Locate|locate]] spell with unlimited range. Avoiding the terms of an infernal contract is difficult and often dangerous.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Infernal Investment** A contract devil can cast a 10th-level innate [[DATABASE/spell/Scrying|scrying]] spell at will, but only to target a creature with which it has a contract. The target automatically critically fails its save.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Infernal Wound** (divine, necromancy) A contract devil’s Strikes also deal 3d6 persistent bleed damage that resist attempts to heal it. The flat check to stop the bleeding starts at DC 20. The DC is reduced to 15 only if the bleeding creature or an ally successfully assists with the recovery.
 The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an infernal wound is increased by 5. A spellcaster or item attempting to use healing magic on a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 29 counteract check or the magic fails to heal the creature.</span>

###  Infernal Contracts

The infernal contracts created by contract devils are not the only ways a devil can engage a mortal in a binding agreement, but they are the most convenient. Other devils must perform complex rituals or jump through bureaucratic hoops to organize a contract with a mortal, and in most cases the easiest solution for devils in this situation is to simply enlist the aid of a contract devil.
