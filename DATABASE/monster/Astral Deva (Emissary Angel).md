description: 'The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant with a voracious appetite.
  Rather than consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling
  prey and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls
  the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin
  vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its
  root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat
  changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its
  learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.<br/><br/>As it is slow
  moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area for as long
  as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails or swamps,
  these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly tended fields,
  and vineyards. While assassin vines can''t be trained in the classical sense, they
  can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins and fey have
  been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes into their
  lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious than
  its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure the bones
  of the vines'' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting in
  what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.<br/><br/>Mature
  assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main
  trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout
  every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally
  bear small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump, blood-red
  berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant iron aftertaste,
  as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge

# Astral Deva (Emissary Angel)

Astral devas are the elite messengers and emissaries of the celestial realms, serving deities and celestial armies by delivering messages, performing reconnaissance, and providing support for those in need of aid. They watch over planar travelers and take powerful mortals under their wings to mentor them. Astral devas carry scrolls containing important messages and other celestial secrets.
Astral devas can form spontaneously from the souls of exceptional good-aligned mortals, but are also sometimes created from such souls intentionally by deities or demigods. In the later cases, astral devas often bear physical features that mark them as closely affiliated with that deity. An astral deva created by Sarenrae, for example, might have hair made of fire, while one created by Torag might look more dwarven, and one created by Desna could have butterfly wings instead of feathered wings. It’s not unusual for astral devas created by lawful good or chaotic good deities to share their creators’ alignment.
