# Leng Ghoul

In the icy nightmare dimension of Leng, ghouls with hoofed feet gather in morbid groups to worship and research, forming societies that mockingly mimic (and in their opinion, surpass) those of the living. Most worship the malevolent gods of the Elder Mythos and see the living as little more than fodder who will eventually die and provide memories for Leng ghouls to consume and absorb. Not all Leng ghouls are evil, but most are, and even those who aren't possess sardonic senses of humor and grisly appetites that make them disturbing allies at best.

 The Leng ghoul can immediately attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] check to learn one non-secret memory the corpse had when it was alive (use the standard DC for the creature's level). The exact memory learned is determined by the GM but is typically something of use to the Leng ghoul.

###  Corpse Libraries

Because Leng ghouls can draw lore from the flesh they consume, their temples often contain libraries that would, to the untrained eye, look more like abattoirs of preserved corpses. Here, a curious Leng ghoul can browse and feed simultaneously, or even research secrets that have long laid dormant in the dead.
