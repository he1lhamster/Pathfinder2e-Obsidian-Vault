# Gluttonworm

Akiton's gluttonworms share many features of Golarion's [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Cave Worm|cave worms]], yet these immense predators are their own distinct species. Gluttonworms “swim” through the vast deserts of Akiton, moving almost like whales through the ocean as they forage for their next meals.

###  Forever Ravenous

A gluttonworm's metabolism is slow; they can go for years or even decades without a filling meal. Most gluttonworms exist in a constant state of ravenous pain as a result, and behave in an incredibly aggressive manner when they encounter anything edible. Most native creatures know to stay well away from the telltale rumbling and shifting dunes that portend a gluttonworm's approach.

### Thasteron

This unusual mineral can be found throughout Akiton. While not suitable for crafting items, the shimmering greenish ore that contains thasteron can be refined into a volatile liquid fuel—either through technological methods or, more efficiently, through the use of khefak, arthropods who feed on the ore and secrete refined thasteron. Thasteron can be used to fuel a wide range of devices, ranging from weapons to appliances to vehicles. The fuel is slightly radioactive—not enough to cause immediate harm, but prolonged exposure can cause long-term health concerns for most living creatures.
 A significant part of Akiton's economy is based on the mining, refining, and trade of thasteron, but off-planet the liquid is relatively worthless without proper technology to take advantage of it. Prices for raw thasteron aren't included in this adventure as a result. A character foolish enough to ingest thasteron must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 3]] (and also drained 1 on a critical failure). Thasteron can be used to create alchemical bombs as well—these bombs are identical to [[DATABASE/equipment/Alchemist's Fire|alchemist's fire]].
