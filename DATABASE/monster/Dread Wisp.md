# Dread Wisp

Will-o'-wisps native to the Darklands are more ominous and malevolent than those that bob about in the lonely marshes and surfaces of the upper world. These dread wisps instill terror with eerie shifts of light and consume the fear they create, drawing life energy from their victims in the process. While dread wisps can survive anywhere within the Darklands, they prefer moist areas like partially submerged caves, the banks of underground rivers, and towering fungus gardens.
 Dread wisps don't glow as brightly as surface will-o'-wisps because even the dimmest light attracts notice underground. Long-lived and hateful creatures, they remember vivid details about their lives, travels, and most delicious prey. Although dread wisps could share extensive lore and unique experiences, they don't, as they find amusement in others' ignorance.

###  Dread Wisp Origins

The origins of will-o'-wisps are hotly debated, but dread wisps have a commonly understood origin. Surface wisps give momentary hope to those lost and scared in a dark and damp wilderness, but nearly all of the Darklands is dark and damp. Hope has little place here, and defiant people and menacing monsters populate the Darklands. Subterranean will-o'-wisps adapted to overcome these new, resilient food sources. Dread wisps descended from those tenacious survivors.
