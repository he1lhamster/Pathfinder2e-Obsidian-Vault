# Wolliped

Wollipeds are large, docile herd animals found in the snowy foothills of large mountains. Their eight legs give them sure footing even in icy terrain, and they grow thick, warm fleece as protection against the elements.
 Arctic ranchers have been breeding wollipeds for hundreds of years, as the gentle creatures take well to domestication and make plentiful, hardy sources of meat, milk, and wool. The creatures also provide sure-footed transport in difficult mountain regions, and they can even be trained for plowing and hauling if necessary.
 As a result of their widespread domestication, few are found in the wild. Young wollipeds have weak vision during their first few weeks and habitually follow any larger creature that walks by. Usually, these young wollipeds become attached their rancher or parents, but on occasion a few might follow large wild creatures and wander off from their herd. This has led to feral wollipeds around the Kodar mountains in Irrisen that are much more aggressive than their domesticated cousins.
 Wollipeds are extremely sturdy, and their docile temperaments make them excellent mounts for those traveling mountain passes. Some mountain settlements have further trained their wollipeds to fight. Battle-ready wollipeds are formidable enemies that pose a threat to even the most experienced of challengers—But even untrained, wollipeds are not defenseless. In addition to their long tusks, they have developed spitting as a way of communication and assault, and readily regurgitate a mixture of stomach acid and the remnants of their last meal to deter predators.
 Few on Golarion realize that these arctic beasts are not native to their world. Wollipeds originated on the planet Triaxus, a world with a magically enhanced eccentric orbit around the same star as Golarion. During the centuries-long Triaxian winters, wollipeds play an integral role in many communities as food, wool, transportation, and even a simple form of companionship. During the equally extended tropical summers, wollipeds retreat to the polar extremes of their world to await the return of the long snows.

###  Warm Fuzzies

Once a year, wollipeds are shorn and their fleece is spun into massive skeins of yarn. This yarn is mostly sold to surrounding villages, but savvy ranchers sell their fleece as far out as Whitethrone in Irrisen and throughout several of the kingdoms in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Wolliped fiber takes well to dyeing methods, and the yarn is easy to knit into complex patterns. Some villages have competitions to make the most elaborate sculptures out of their wolliped yarn.
