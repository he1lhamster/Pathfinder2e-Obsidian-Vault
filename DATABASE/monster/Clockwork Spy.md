# Clockwork Spy

Engineers, technologists, and mechanically gifted wizards employ clockwork spies—tiny, spiderlike constructs capable of recording and playing back audio— to surreptitiously surveil their enemies or steal secrets from competitors. Their spindly bodies and delicate components make them unsuitable for combat; in fact, most builders construct clockwork spies with a self-destruct mechanism to ensure the spies' meddling can't be traced back to them.

**Record Audio <span class="action-icon">1</span> ** The clockwork spy records all sounds within 25 feet onto a small gemstone worth 1 gp embedded in its body. The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound on a single gemstone.
 Once it begins recording, it can't cease recording early, nor can it record onto a gemstone that already contains a recording. Some clockwork spies contain multiple gemstones to allow for a series of recordings. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they must be given simple commands regarding when to start recording sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between different kinds of creatures but not between specific individuals.
 The spy can start or stop playback of recorded sound by spending a single action. Removing a gemstone from or installing a gemstone into a clockwork spy requires a successful DC 14 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]]; on a failure, the gemstone is undamaged, but any recorded sounds are erased and the gemstone still can't be used to make another recording.
**Wind-Up** 24 hours, DC 14, standby
