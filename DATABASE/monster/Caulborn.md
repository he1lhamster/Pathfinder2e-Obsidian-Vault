# Caulborn

Telepathic prophets and historians, caulborn gather in small cabals for protection and camaraderie, using their collective brainpower to unravel cosmic conundrums. Once they've exhausted an area's secrets, they depart, seeking new homes hidden within cities, sequestering themselves within caves, or lurking in forgotten corners of the planes. From the moment an [[DATABASE/monster/Ioton|ioton]] absorbs especially profound thoughts and begins taking on the permanent form of a young caulborn, these ennosites' genius and toughness grow with each new discovery. Absorbing such information destabilizes their corporeal form, like when books are stacked too high, so excess knowledge seeps from a caulborn's body, causing a literal brain drain that caulborn find incredibly vexing. To avoid this occurrence, caulborn must feed on others' psychic energy to maintain themselves, which is usually a harmless process. Especially hungry caulborn even abduct prey.
 Despite their need to feed, caulborn rarely care to interact with other creatures, especially beings that could react to their appearance with fear or hostility. They occasionally make exceptions for accomplished scholars or storied travelers, however, bartering their own lore for outside secrets.

**Collective Sense** (divination, mental, occult) Caulborn are aware of all other caulborn within 300 feet, with the effects of a [[DATABASE/spell/Status|status]] spell, and they can perceive anything within the other caulborns' thoughtsense. If two or more caulborn are within range of each others' thoughtsense, they can't be flanked.
**Thoughtsense** (divination, mental, occult) The caulborn senses all non-mindless creatures at the listed range.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Consume Thoughts** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (mental) **Requirements** The caulborn's last action was a successful hand Strike; **Effect** The caulborn steals some of the psychic energy from the creature it hit. The target must attempt a DC 25 Will save; regardless of the outcome, the creature is temporarily immune to Consume Thoughts for 1 minute. 
**Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Failure** The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]] for 1 minute, and the caulborn regains 1d12 Hit Points. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is stupefied 3 for 1 minute and the caulborn regains 2d12 Hit Points. If the target was already stupefied when the caulborn used this ability, the target is also [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Cooperative Scrying** (divination, occult, scrying) Three or more caulborn adjacent to each other can collectively cast [[DATABASE/spell/Scrying|scrying]] once per day (DC 25), with no limit to the duration so long as at least three caulborn remain adjacent and use no actions other than to Sustain the Spell. The daily limit applies to all caulborn who participated, meaning none of them can participate in another _scrying_ that day.</span>

###  Macabre Symbosis

Deep below the eclectic city of Kaer Maga can be found a curious society of caulborn and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire|vampires]]. For millennia these creatures have fed off each other in peace, the vampires providing thoughts and the caulborn blood, all while spying upon the curious inhabitants of the city far above. Elsewhere, caulborn form even stranger alliances.
