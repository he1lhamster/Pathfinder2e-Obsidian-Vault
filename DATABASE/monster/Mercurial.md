# Mercurial

Some of the most populous denizens of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Metal|Plane of Metal]], mercurials are weird creatures of liquid metal known for changing their features, chemical compositions, and temperaments with equal frequency. Excitable, curious, and friendly, mercurials are quick to offer assistance to extraplanar beings, but their volatile personalities can make them unreliable allies.

###  Many Faces, Many Names

As immortal beings with comparatively short attention spans, mercurials invariably become bored with their current identities sooner or later and seek a change by adopting a new face and persona. To avoid confusion among friends and acquaintances, a mercurial's name typically consists not only of their current moniker, but a list of the last few names used, presented in chronological order as far back as the mercurial can remember.
