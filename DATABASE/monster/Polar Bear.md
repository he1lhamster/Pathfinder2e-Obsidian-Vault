# Polar Bear

Polar bears are known for their pale fur, with black eyes, lips, and toe pads. They are aggressively predatory creatures, stalking prey for miles on land or across the icy waters of frozen oceans. They are also amazing ambush predators, leaping from the water to ambush seals resting on ice floes. If they are desperate, polar bears hunt not only other animals but also humanoids.

###  Vengeful Beasts

Polar bears have been known to take special interest in those who have vexed or wounded them, sometimes following individual hunters back to their villages and stalking them exclusively for several days. This could happen because the hunter killed the bear's mate or one of its cubs, or took prey that the polar bear had been stalking. Polar bears engaged in such behavior have even ignored easier prey to focus intently on the chosen target.
