# Hound Archon

Among the rank-and-file soldiers of Heaven's armies, few individuals are more dependable and truer to the cause than the noble hound archons, embodiments of the virtue of diligence. Unlike [[DATABASE/monster/Horned Archon|horned archons]], who perform at a similar level along Heaven's grand hierarchy, hound archons do not scout ahead for evil or perform reconnaissance missions in hostile territory. A hound archon's role is as a soldier in the heart of battle or, occasionally, as a sentinel tasked with protecting a particular strategic location or holy site.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Archon's Door** Once per day, if an archon sees another creature cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dimension Door|dimension door]], the archon can use dimension door (heightened to 5th level) within 1 round to attempt to follow that creature to the maximum distance of the archon's dimension door. If the archon's dimension door has enough distance, the archon appears the same distance and direction from the creature as before either creature used dimension door.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) A hound archon can take the appearance of any canid animal of Small to Large size. This doesn't change their Speed or the attack and damage bonuses for their Strikes, but if the canid's bite attack has the [[DATABASE/monsterability/Knockdown|Knockdown]] ability, then the hound archon's bite attack gains that ability while they are in that form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Diligent Assault** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The hound archon carefully makes one greatsword Strike and one jaws Strike in any order. These attacks count toward the hound archon's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks.</span>
