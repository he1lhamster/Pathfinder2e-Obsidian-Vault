# Sarglagon (Drowning Devil)

Sarglagons dwell in [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell's]] myriad waterways, lakes, and oceans. They serve as guardians of the Academy of Lies—the repository of secrets in Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell. Sarglagons breathe water and air with equal ease, and can move through water, land, and even air with uncanny swiftness. Few fiends travel the waterways of the multiverse, but where a river crosses the planes, odds are sarglagons have traveled it to further their infernal machinations. The only body of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the fiends have yet to develop any defense against that waterway's memory-sapping qualities. Mortal spellcasters sometimes bind sarglagons as guardians of precious secrets or treasures, particularly in aquatic areas. Most strangely, sarglagons sometimes act as unnerving caretakers to mortals who have no idea what they did to earn their unwanted protectors' attention. The constant uninvited vigilance of these devils is often disturbing and stifling to their wards.
