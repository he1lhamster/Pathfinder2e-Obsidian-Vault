# Toshigami

Toshigami are especially powerful kami who protect cherry trees, particularly ones in places where the primeval powers of nature remain strong. The cycle of blossoming, flourishing, and wilting that cherry trees exhibit provides a striking visual metaphor for toshigami, who wield immense powers over growth, decay, and even time.
 Also known as blossom kami, toshigami have a particular fascination with mortals. Many folk legends tell of toshigami who bestow their blessing unto worthy individuals who fight for just causes. Likewise, it isn't unheard of for toshigami to aid virtuous souls in dire need of healing or restoration. In truth, blossom kami are so rare and enigmatically aloof that few mortals have ever encountered such beings. Decades, even centuries, might pass before a humble village realizes that a toshigami inhabits its beloved cherry tree.
 The stories persist, however, as they have for ages, leading to a widespread appreciation for cherry trees. The site of a new village might be chosen due to its proximity to an ancient cherry tree, and cherry trees are planted and carefully tended in larger population centers, both for their beauty and out of respect for the blossom kami. Should a toshigami choose one such tree as their ward, so much the better for the entire community.

**Ward** (abjuration, divine) Every kami is bound to a ward: a specific animal, plant, object, or location. A kami can merge with or emerge from their ward as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. While merged, the kami can observe their surroundings with their usual senses as well as the senses of their ward, but can't move, communicate with, or control their ward. Additionally, a kami merged with their ward recovers Hit Points each minute as if they spent an entire day resting.
A toshigami's ward is a specific cherry tree.
**Items** _+2 [[Striking]] staff_

<span class="in-box-ability">**Fleeting Blossoms** A toshigami's staff Strikes stir up fleeting cherry blossoms that bloom, wilt, and decay all in the space of an instant. On a hit, they deal an additional 1d6 mental damage, as well as an additional 1d6 negative damage to living creatures and an additional 1d6 positive damage to undead.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Swift Staff Strike** <span class="action-icon">2</span> In a rapid series of movements, the toshigami unleashes a deadly assault. The toshigami makes three staff Strikes. The toshigami's multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after they've made all three Strikes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Touch of Ages** (curse, divine) A toshigami's attacks bestow a curse that alters the very flow of time in those they attack. When a toshigami hits a creature with a melee Strike, the creature must attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save as its perspective shifts rapidly between that of advanced age and an infantile state. Regardless of the outcome, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature becomes [[Clumsy]], [[Enfeebled]], and [[Stupefied]] for 1 round. 
**Failure** The creature becomes clumsy 2, enfeebled 2, and stupefied 2 for 1 minute. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the conditions are permanent.</span>
