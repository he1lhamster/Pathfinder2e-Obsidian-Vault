# Spirit Turtle

Spirit turtles are benevolent fey known to heal those in need and confer other powerful gifts. These gentle giants resemble enormous turtles and often bear entire ecosystems on their shells.
 In ancient times, so the legend goes, spirit turtles used to grant wishes to many mortals. After millennia of such encounters, the giant creatures grew tired and went into hiding or returned to their home plane, the [[First World]]. Those few spirit turtles who remain on Golarion now grant their favors only to the purest and worthiest mortal petitioners.

###  Spiritual Tasks

Most spirit turtles grant an extended lifetime as gift for completing an important task. The requirements of a task vary from turtle to turtle, but they are always massive undertakings. In one part of the saga of Artimos the Tailor, Artimos met with a spirit turtle and earned their favor by sewing a quilt as massive as the lake in which the turtle slept. The quilt required cloth from the robes of each ruler in Tian Xia, but Artimos's efforts eventually earned him a golden needle to aid him on his journeys.
