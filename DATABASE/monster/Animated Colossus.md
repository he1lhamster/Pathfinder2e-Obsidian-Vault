<span class="in-box-ability">**Construct Armor** Like normal objects, an animated colossus has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage the colossus takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an animated colossus is reduced to fewer than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks, removing the Hardness and reducing its Armor Class to 35 when broken.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Enormous** An animated colossus takes up a space of 6 squares by 6 squares (30 feet by 30 feet) and is 100 feet tall.</span>
