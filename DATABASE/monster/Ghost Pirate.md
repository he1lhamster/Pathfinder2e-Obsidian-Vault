# Ghost Pirate

Undead prowling the ocean on derelict ships have long been threats sailors keep an eye out for. Other than corporeal undead, some undead pirates take on an incorporeal form, especially if their bodies have been lost to the fishes. Captains of crews in particular are likely to return from the dead, perhaps on account of their strong personalities.

###  Face of a Crew

Just because a ship has a ghostly captain doesn't mean the entire crew—or what remains of them— are all ghosts. Many command [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Skeleton|skeletons]], [[DATABASE/monster/Ghoul|ghouls]], and [[DATABASE/monster/Draugr|draugr]] as well. Occasionally, a ghost captain is an extension of a [[DATABASE/monster/Bone Ship|bone ship]], giving its prey one last chance to surrender.
