# Hyphae Tyrant

Leshy creations sometimes fall prey to herbivores and foragers. Whereas most take the loss in stride, fungus leshies sometimes grow bitter and explore the grimmer elements of fungi: decomposition and possession. Combining unethical experiments, mind-altering cordyceps spores, and occult magic fueled by their own victim narrative, a fungus leshy can transform into a hyphae tyrant, who in turn transforms corpses into sporeborn puppets to torment local fauna. These leshies' greatest tragedy is perhaps their own impermanence. As their agendas increasingly celebrate decay, a hyphae tyrant's spite and occult narrative slowly drain their life force, ultimately ending in a final burst of destructive energy.

### Creating Mycoguardians

To create a mycoguardian, such as a sporeborn, a ritualist can perform a ritual similar to [[DATABASE/ritual/Create Undead|create undead]] called _create mycoguardian_, but providing valuable parasitic fungal spores instead of black onyx. This ritual uses Fungus Lore (trained) or Nature (expert) for both the Primary Check and Secondary Checks, and lacks the Evil trait.
