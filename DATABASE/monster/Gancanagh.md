description: "Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium. Embodiments\

  \ who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings\
  \ that profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially\
  \ the demonic tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free\
  \ love. One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such\
  \ a creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed\
  \ paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy\
  \ drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can\u2019t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many gancanaghs\

# Gancanagh (Passion Azata)

Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium. Embodiments of free love, they eagerly throw themselves into courting targets for brief but earnest flings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve Cayden Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings that profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially the demonic tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free love. One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such a creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can’t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking smoking pipes because they think it makes them look dapper. They cherish their silver flutes, for they enjoy the beauty of flutes’ music and its ability to sway the heart.
The majority of gancanaghs present themselves as male, but the concept of gender to a creature like a gancanagh, which can change its shape freely, is much more fluid and open to interpretation than for many mortals.
