# Qormintur

As the seneschal of the influential [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Drow|drow]] [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Mummy|mummy]] [[DATABASE/monster/Dyzallin Shraen|Dyzallin Shraen]], Qormintur administers most of her master's business transactions and assets. She is Dyzallin's trusted ally, and upon his departure, she continues to study the ruins of Xul-Khundur on his behalf.
When Qormintur was just 10 years old, her family decided to sell their business in a small [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Duergar|duergar]] settlement and look for new opportunities in the Darklands city of Hagegraf. A few days after departing, duergar slavers attacked their caravan, murdered her father, and captured everyone else. Qormintur was sold as a slave in Shraen, and she never found out where her mother or siblings were taken. She did discover, however, that one of her father's business rivals had blackmailed her parents to leave, and the same duergar had arranged for the slavers to attack the caravan. The memories of that betrayal and the loss of her family still haunt her, and her deepest desire is to get her revenge.
 When she arrived in Shraen, Qormintur was first taken to the city's slave pens to be sold as a laborer, personal attendant, or fodder for one of Shraen's undead nobles. Despite the hopelessness, fear, and anxiety she witnessed in the slave pens of Shraen, her spirit never broke. When she was brought to auction, a sadistic [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire|vampire]] named Zihain Shraen attempted to purchase her (and likely make her one of his many playthings). The mummy Dyzallin Shraen outbid the vampire; Qormintur believes that pity or compassion caused Dyzallin to save her from a fate worse than death, but in truth, Dyzallin simply wanted to spite Zihain.
 During her first few years as Dyzallin's slave, the ancient drow never failed to remind Qormintur that he had saved her, and that her life was his to take if she ever disobeyed him. At first, Qormintur resented Dyzallin, but as years turned into decades, a strange bond of mutual trust formed between the soulless drow and the young duergar. In a city where trust was a commodity harder to come by than adamantine or diamonds, Dyzallin formed a bond with his servant. Dyzallin kept her close to him and encouraged her personal interests in alchemy. As a reward for her service, Dyzallin has promised to transform her into a mummy. So far, she hasn't considered the offer very seriously; after all, at barely a century old, she's young for a duergar.
 Appearances matter in Shraen, so despite Qormintur's trusted position, Dyzallin still makes her display her slave brands on her forearms. As Dyzallin's seneschal, Qormintur takes care of many administrative tasks for him, including buying and selling magic items and other slaves. This position has often put her into contact with the same duergar slavers who once brought ruin to her family. For now, she is forced to hide her feelings, but when the opportunity presents itself, she will not hesitate to exact her revenge. She is more than capable of doing just that—Qormintur is a potent combat alchemist and often leads Dyzallin's forces against [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Urdefhan|urdefhans]] and other threats. Dyzallin tasked Qormintur with marshalling his forces from Shraen to the lost pyramid of Xul-Khundur, and with securing the site so Dyzallin could study the magic orb at the pyramid in peace. After Dyzallin returned to Shraen with the orb, Qormintur organized guards and has continued her master's research to unearth more of the pyramid's secrets. This research hasn't met with many results so far, and Qormintur is starting to get bored and to wonder whether she's been abandoned. Despite her loyalty to Dyzallin, Qormintur is painfully aware that she doesn't really belong in Shraen, but also that she can never return to her people. Now that she has spent time outside of Shraen and out of Dyzallin's domineering presence, a new thirst for independence is brewing inside her.
 Qormintur is a lean, young duergar woman who wears a fine blue cloak over beautifully crafted [[DATABASE/equipment/Mithral|mithral]] armor. Her forearms bear sinister-looking brands that match those on her armor and cloak; these brands mark her and her equipment as property of Dyzallin. Her eyes are cold and betray a hint of sadness.

## Campaign Role

If Qormintur survives the encounter with the heroes, she tries to warn Dyzallin about their interference. If you decide to add a greater challenge to the climactic battle, she can fight alongside Dyzallin in his tower (replacing one of the uthuls accompanying him). If the heroes capture Qormintur, she might suggest they offer to trade her for the orb. Of course, Dyzallin won't give up the orb for Qormintur; when he refuses, she could have a change of heart and side with the heroes if they have treated her well. Finally, if the heroes are remarkably persuasive, they might convince Qormintur to abandon Dyzallin's cause and leave the Black Desert to find a new home.
