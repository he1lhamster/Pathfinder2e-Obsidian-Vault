# Peri

Peris are contrary, artful celestials renowned for their beauty as much as their deceptive natures. Mercurial, though never malicious, peris strive to aid mortals, though they are more likely to dispense riddles and quests than to offer aid outright.

###  The Lambent Court

Though they eschew servitude and the worship of gods, many peris consider themselves friends and allies of [[DATABASE/deity/Atreia|Atreia]], the Lambent King, the imprisoned elemental lord of fire. They guard and conceal his holy sites from his enemies and send mortals out in search of his prison, the _Garnet Brand_, hoping to bring the benevolent force of exalted light and fire back into the multiverse.
