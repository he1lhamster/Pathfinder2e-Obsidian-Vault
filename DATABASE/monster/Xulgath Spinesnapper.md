# Xulgath Spinesnapper

Xulgath physiological diversity doesn’t always imply drastic change; some xulgaths are simply much larger and stronger than their clutchmates. Most xulgaths call such siblings spinesnappers, though terms like bonebreaker, marrowvent, or similarly violent epithets are equally common. A typical spinesnapper is 9 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds.
 In battle, spinesnappers have all the speed, grace, and strength of a sledgehammer. They are ideal shock troops and make a good first line of defense. When an inter-clutch conflict leads to a duel, spinesnappers are typically called upon to rise to the challenge. In this case, a spinesnapper representative from each clutch squares off for what is in theory a nonlethal wrestling match, after which the winner scrapes off some of the loser’s scales as a trophy.

###  Unusual Origins

Not all spinesnappers are the result of typical xulgath mutations. Some are created by botched stone-bindings—where the process merely increases their size and strength instead of granting them full earthen power—or even demonic rites. In the latter case, such fiend-touched spinesnappers might grow additional limbs, hyperextended jaws, or other fearsome signs of their brush with the Abyss.
