# Skeletal Soldier

These soldiers continue to follow orders in death, still wielding the armaments they spent a lifetime learning how to use. While frequently made from the bones of humans or dwarves, other types of humanoids are quite common, such as bugbears, hobgoblins, and orcs. Often, these soldiers wield the weapons most common among their people instead of those listed here.
