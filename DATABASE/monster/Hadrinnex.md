# Hadrinnex

The bizarre hadrinnexes resemble defensive systems more than living creatures. They evolve at a rapid rate, but only to specific attacks against them, which suggests they were created through advanced technology or magic. The husk surrounding a hadrinnex—flecks of metal suspended in a malleable organic carapace—reshapes in response to harm. So too can a glowing gland within the creature's thorax, which collects energy and restructures the creature's biology to protect it from that energy. This organ is fragile and ruptures soon after a hadrinnex is killed.
 Hadrinnexes have only a rudimentary intellect and usually follow more intelligent aberrations. As bodyguards or peons, they perform simple tasks diligently. Though poor at problem-solving and improvisation, hadrinnexes' dependability and adaptive physiology make them ideal for dangerous tasks in hazardous environments.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Rapid Evolution <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (morph, occult, transmutation) **Trigger** The hadrinnex takes damage of a physical or energy damage type (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing for physical; acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, or sonic for energy) **Effect** The hadrinnex reconfigures its husk (if triggered by physical damage) or its energy gland (if triggered by energy damage). Any reconfiguration applies to the triggering damage and lasts until the next time the hadrinnex uses Rapid Evolution.

* **Energy Gland** Reconfiguring the energy gland changes both the hadrinnex's energy damage resistance and the damage of its energy ray to that type. By default, the energy gland is configured to sonic.
* **Husk** The hadrinnex's physical damage resistance and the damage of its weapon arm Strikes change to the triggering type. Weapon arm Strikes gain an additional trait depending on the current damage type: bludgeoning adds shove, piercing adds deadly d8, and slashing adds sweep. By default the husk is configured to bludgeoning.

It either blasts the energy to deal 7d6 energy damage to creatures in a 30-foot cone (DC 26 basic Reflex save), or directs the energy to its weapon arms, making its weapon arm Strikes deal an extra 2d6 energy damage for 1 minute. Either one expends the damage type stored in the hadrinnex's energy gland, as described below. 
After the energy is vented, the energy gland goes dormant. The hadrinnex loses its energy resistance and can't use energy ray until it uses Rapid Evolution to reconfigure its energy gland again. Directing energy to its weapon arms again removes any previous energy boost to its weapon arm.</span>

###  Hibernation Pods

Hadrinnexes can be found hibernating in remote areas, their husks shaped into ovoid pods. These pods are usually centered in craters, suggesting the hadrinnex fell from above. Leaving hibernation takes 2 months as it extrudes its limbs and restarts biological processes. This can be accelerated with a daily influx of energy to its energy gland.
