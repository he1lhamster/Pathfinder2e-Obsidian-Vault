# Cactus Leshy

These little plants are known for their nettlesome attitude. Their personalities mirror the spines that sprout from all over their bodies, making them cantankerous and slightly prickly, though they are unswervingly loyal to those who earn their trust. At home in dry and arid landscapes, cactus leshys store water inside their bodies in order to survive these harsh conditions.
 Cactus leshys come in all different shapes and colors: tall and thin, with beautiful, vibrantly colored blooms on their heads; squat and rotund, with rows and rows of orderly spines; or seemingly haphazard, with flat segments stacked end to end as if they were balancing on one another.

**Little Oasis** If a cactus leshy is willing, a creature can harvest enough water from the leshy's inner cavity to fill a single [[DATABASE/equipment/Waterskin|waterskin]] without harming them. Doing so again before the leshy can replenish the water causes the leshy to immediately suffer from dehydration.

###  Water Storage

Due to their internal cavities, cactus leshys can give water to surrounding creatures in times of need. They can give up to half of their water reserves without perishing. They might choose to sacrifice their water to help nearby plants that are parched or to save a comrade who is dying of thirst. Extracting water from a cactus leshy is not an exact science, so one must take care not to let the water slosh out of the leshy, lest it die from dehydration.
