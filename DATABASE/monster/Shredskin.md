While controlling a host, the shredskin uses the host's Speed but its own attacks, and it loses its Grab and Enshroud abilities. Attacks that target the shredskin while it controls a body deal half of the damage to the shredskin and half of the damage to the host body. Attacks that target an area deal damage to both the shredskin and host body normally. The shredskin can release the host body as a free action at the start of its turn. If the host is destroyed, the shredskin automatically releases the body and is flat-footed for 1 round. A Medium corpse typically has 15 Hit Points, while a Small corpse typically has 10 Hit Points. Creatures can notice that a corpse is controlled by a shredskin by succeeding a Perception check against the shredskin's [[Deception]] DC.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Enshroud** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** The shredskin is grabbing a creature; **Effect** The shredskin attempts to pin the creature and wrap itself around the creature like a shirt. The shredskin rolls an [[Athletics]] check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes [[Restrained]] and the shredskin can take control of the creature as if using Control Body. At the start of its turn, the shredskin can automatically Constrict the enshrouded creature as a free action. An enshrouded creature can attempt a DC 16 [[Escape]] check to break free (DC 18 if the shredskin critically succeeded its Athletics check to Enshroud).</span>
