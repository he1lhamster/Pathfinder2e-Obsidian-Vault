# Shoal Linnorm

Shoal linnorms occupy rocky shoreline shallows and slither along lonely coastlines. While they do not intentionally seek out large settlements, these linnorms nonetheless beleaguer fishers headed out from small coastal towns, and they may even follow skiffs back to their home port to appraise the town's defenses and plan a raid. Shoal linnorms tend to hunt large prey, both underwater and on land. Their preferred quarries includes giant squid and grizzly bears—meals rich in fat, which the linnorms metabolize into the fiery steam that courses through their veins.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (evocation, fire, primal, water) The shoal linnorm exhales scalding steam that deals 12d8 fire damage in a 60-foot cone (DC 36 basic Reflex save). The steam lingers until the end of the linnorm's next turn; anyone who enters the area or begins their turn in the area takes 6d8 fire damage (DC 36 Reflex save negates). During this time, the steam is so thick that it impedes movement as well as sight, turning the area into difficult terrain. All creatures in the steam become [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the steam become concealed to creatures within it.
