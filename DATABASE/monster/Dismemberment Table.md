<span class="in-box-ability">**Construct Armor** Like normal objects, an animated object has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an animated object is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 18.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Haunted** The dismemberment table is powered by unquiet spirits, and it takes damage from positive energy as if it were undead. Positive energy bypasses the table's hardness.</span>

If this Strike hits, the blade cuts deep into one of the target's limbs. The target must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save. 
**Critical Success** The creature suffers no additional effect. 
**Success** The creature takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]. 
**Failure** The creature takes 2d6 persistent bleed damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]]. This clumsy condition ends once the creature is restored to full Hit Points. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but clumsy 2.</span>
