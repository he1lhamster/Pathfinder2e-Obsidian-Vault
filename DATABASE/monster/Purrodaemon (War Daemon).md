# Purrodaemon (War Daemon)

Few creatures embody war's sheer amount of bloodshed and loss of life as deeply as the purrodaemons, deacons of war. These giant humanoid daemons are bedecked in black, unholy armor, with weapons piercing their flesh at every opening. Far from wounds, however, these weapons are the purrodaemon's arsenal. A purrodaemon can, with frightening swiftness and nauseating ease, extract a weapon from its own flesh as though drawing a sword from a sheath, and their blood is so tainted with evil that weapons steeped in it become powerful tools of war.

 If a purrodaemon Interacts to crush a soul gem, one weapon of their choice sheathed in their flesh becomes enchanted with the daemon's fiendish power and becomes a +2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] weapon that can be used in place of their glaive or hurled at targets (with a +2 item bonus to the hurled weapon's attack modifier and an extra d10 of damage). This magical quality fades 24 hours after it ceases being sheathed in the daemon's living body.
