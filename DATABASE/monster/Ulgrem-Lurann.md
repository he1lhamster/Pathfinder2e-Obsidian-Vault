# Ulgrem-Lurann

[[DATABASE/monster/Ulgrem-Axaan|Ulgrem-Axaan]] has a limited ability to respond to magical telepathy with a handful of words in Necril. The name Ulgrem-Axaan originally comes from the creature itself, and the rough approximation in Necril suggests that Ulgrem was its species with Axaan noting it as the last of its kind. Characters capable of cleansing Ulgrem-Axaan's eggs can watch the hatchlings grow into creatures resembling Ulgrem-Axaan, save that they lack any kind of undead touch. Upon seeing these young for the first time, if Ulgrem-Axaan is able to do so, it grants them the name “Ulgrem-Lurann.” Through the same rough approximation, Ulgrem-Lurann means something akin to “Children of Ulgrem.”

**Bump in the River** An Ulgrem-Lurann can pretend to be a floating log while in water by attempting a [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check. It has a +2 circumstance bonus to its checks and DCs to do so. While using Stealth this way, creatures see the log but don't realize it's an Ulgrem-Lurann.
