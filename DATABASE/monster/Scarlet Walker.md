# Scarlet Walker

During the height of Thassilon's power, agents of Runelord Karzoug and Runelord Sorshen often called scarlet walkers to Golarion from Leng. Although these elephant-sized monstrosities largely despise other inhabitants of Leng, some swallow their pride to work alongside the [[DATABASE/monster/Denizen of Leng|denizens of Leng]] or [[DATABASE/monster/Leng Ghoul|Leng ghouls]] in exchange for passage into the waking world.
**Recall Knowledge - Aberration ([[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]])**: DC 35

###  Pools of Blood

In the ragged valleys and badlands of their home plane, Leng, scarlet walkers build grisly cities of braided flesh and coagulated blood. There, they spend their days gathering and discussing the values and uses of all types of blood and meat. Some who have looked upon the roiling blood pools of Leng whisper of similarities to the _Everdawn Pool_ and wonder if these creations were the true inspirations for the infamous runewells of Thassilon.
