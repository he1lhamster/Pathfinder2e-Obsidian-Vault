# Soul Slime

Soul slimes are swirling, blue-gray masses of protoplasm that feed on the quintessence contained within souls. Typically, soul slimes acquire this quintessence by consuming the living, the undead, or souls imprisoned in other objects, although soul slimes can also feed on the quintessence of the Outer Planes and their occupants. Soul slimes digest these siphoned souls over decades. As long as a portion of a soul remains undigested, a soul slime can adopt the shape and use the vocalizations of that soul—a tactic soul slimes routinely adopt to get close to their prey while hunting. As soul slimes lack the intelligence to truly impersonate or mimic the souls they digest, they are obvious facsimiles and are entirely incapable of speech.

###  Where In The World?

Soul slimes are primarily found on the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], feeding off the living and undead. While they can be found anywhere living or undead gather, the most successful live on the fringes of densely populated areas, including farmlands, forests, swamps, slums, and sewers. Soul slimes also live along the River of Souls and on the Outer Planes.
