# Augnagar

The brutish and gluttonous augnagar live to feast— preferably on rotten flesh, and when possible, demon flesh. But to them, the greatest delicacy is the flesh of other augnagars. Augnagars have spiderlike legs with leathery membranes like a bat's wings, and three tails ending in hooked claws perfect for slicing flesh.

Any creature within 30 feet of the victim must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or become [[Sickened]] (plus [[Slowed]] on a critical failure, for as long as it's sickened). While within the aura, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute. The victim of the disease doesn't roll a save, but takes the failure effects automatically and can't reduce its sickened value below 1 (1 day).</span>

###  Augnagars and Thulgants

An augnagar that gorges sufficiently, especially on other augnagars, can grow so massive it can't even move, thrashing and festering where it lies. It eventually flies into a frenzy of self-cannibalism as it rips apart its own flesh to feast on. From the ruinous remains emerges a [[Thulgant]]—a smaller but more powerful qlippoth. Scholars are uncertain if other qlippoth are capable of transforming themselves in this fashion. So far, none have returned from the [[Abyss]] with proof.
