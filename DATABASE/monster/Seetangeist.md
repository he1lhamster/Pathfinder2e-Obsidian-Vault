# Seetangeist

Seetangeists are composed of the bloated corpses of marine life, encrusted with bleached coral and wrapped in rotting seaweed. Although occasionally created by water-breathing necromancers, seetangeists most often arise when an aquatic ecosystem collapses, resulting in the deaths of countless creatures. Bound by spiritual trauma, these corpses merge together, forming a writhing school of flesh and decaying plant matter that seeks out and consumes what life remains in the region.
 The disasters that lead to the creation of seetangeists are typically caused by mortal interference: overhunting, ecological overexploitation, pollution, or necromantic magic and experimentation.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Necrotic Runoff** (aura, poison) 60 feet. A seetangeist secretes foul fluids into the surrounding water, poisoning it. A creature that enters or starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 2]] (sickened 3 on a critical failure). Creatures that breathe water take a –2 circumstance penalty to this saving throw. As long as a creature remains in the aura, it can't reduce its sickened condition below 1.

###  Verdorite Variants

Although seetangeists are the most common type of verdorite swarm, other variants can form in any ecosystem, some of which are truly terrifying. Spells of cold and frost used to combat a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Red|red dragon]] in its volcanic lair can inadvertently wipe out entire colonies of algae and snails uniquely adapted to scorching environments. This occasionally gives rise to verdorite swarms that mindlessly grab and burn while being nearly indestructible thanks to their loosely cohesive “bodies” studded with iron-coated shells.
