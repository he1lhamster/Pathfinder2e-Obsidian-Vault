# Rosethorn

These hardy mountain dwellers surpass their lowlander cousins in stubbornness and agility. Rosethorn rams sport distinctive, twisted horns that measure up to 4 feet in length and bear thorny growths, which they use to damage enemies in combat and strip the bark from trees during harsh winters when other food is scarce.
 Though hardly a domesticated species, rosethorn rams' shaggy outer coats cover fine hair that makes a yarn prized for both its softness and rarity. Their milk also provides nourishment during severe seasons.
