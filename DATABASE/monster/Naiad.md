# Naiad

Naiads protect streams, ponds, springs, and other natural bodies of fresh water. While most naiads lead solitary lives close to their chosen ward, sometimes these nymphs congregate in coven-like groups where river tributaries meet, performing great magic and blessing the waters of the land. Because naiads’ bonds to their bodies of water permit more flexibility, they are the nymphs most likely to interact with humanoids and even visit their settlements on occasion. Unlike other nymphs, naiads occasionally become adventurers, especially when dark forces seek to despoil nature or otherwise threaten the land, joining forces with others to prevent the corruption of nature.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Water Dependent** A naiad bonds to a spring, pool, pond, or similar-sized water feature. While within 300 feet of her bonded body of water, she can use her innate tidal surge at will. She doesn’t recover Hit Points or reduce the drained condition when resting beyond that range. Unlike most other nymphs, she doesn’t suffer penalties from being apart from her bonded body of water. A naiad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond herself to a new body of water.</span>
