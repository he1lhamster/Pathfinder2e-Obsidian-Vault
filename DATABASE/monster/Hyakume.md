# Hyakume

Hundreds of bloodshot eyes peek out from under the fleshy layers of a hyakume's skin. These hulking aberrations covet knowledge and go to great lengths to keep what they know to themselves; they'll destroy scriptoriums they've raided and burn books they've read to ensure no other soul learns their contents. While hyakume occasionally trade valuable information to garner greater knowledge, they are liable to trick their targets into revealing more than they should. Most frightening of all is the hyakume's ability to steal memories and erase any knowledge of their existence from the minds of their victims.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Eye Probe** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (divination, occult) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Up to six of the hyakume's eyes detach from the hyakume's body. Each eye has AC 26, HP 1, and a fly speed of 40 feet. The hyakume can see through all of their eye probes. They can move the probes all in separate directions using a single action. A hyakume can have no more than six eye probes active at a time; using this ability to create more causes the eye or eyes farthest away to shrivel and die.
 The hyakume can deliver touch spells through their eye probes and can make melee spell attacks through them. In addition, the hyakume can Steal Memories through an eye probe using a single action by touching the target with the eye.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Scatterbrain Palm** (divination, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, occult) A creature hit by the hyakume's fist Strike must attempt a DC 36 Will save. The creature is then temporarily immune until start of its next turn. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]]. 
**Failure** The creature is stunned 2. 
**Critical Failure** The creature is stunned 3 and the hyakume can use Steal Memories on the target as part of this action.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Steal Memories** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (emotion, mental, necromancy, occult) The hyakume reaches out with their mind and attempts to steal memories from a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 40 Will saving throw or become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]] and have some of its memories stolen. The hyakume learns some of the target's memories (chosen by the GM), which are then lost to the target.</span>

###  Memory Thieves

Hyakume jealously hoard knowledge in the form of memories, their own or stolen. They stalk temples and libraries, memorizing hundreds of texts before obliterating them all. Hyakume have earned a mistaken reputation as nocturnal guardians of shrines and other archives of wisdom. Though they may occasionally thwart thieves and tomb raiders, they do so only to keep the repository's knowledge for themselves.
