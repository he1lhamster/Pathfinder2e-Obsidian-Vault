# Somnalu

With its lithe, sinuous body and a flexible, twisting spine, Somnalu bears a resemblance to a giant lizard, save for its striking visage. Spiny frills run down the creature's mottled black back, interlaced with dull red stripes that streak from head to tail. Its two sets of forelimbs are bound to each other by small webs of skin. Its distinctive face lacks any visible mouth, nose, or ears, instead possessing only a huge red eye surrounded by six smaller, secondary eyes.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Corrosive Wounds** The acid that coats the skin of Somnalu eats away at a weapon that Strikes it. As long as Digestive Secretions is active on Somnalu, whenever a creature hits Somnalu with a metal or wooden weapon, the creature must succeed at a DC 33 Reflex save or else the weapon takes 2d8 acid damage (after dealing damage to Somnalu as normal).

<span class="in-box-ability">**Acid Spew** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Somnalu jets acid from its skin, dousing all creatures in a 15-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in this area takes 10d8 acid damage (DC 33 basic Reflex save). It can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Caustic Trench** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Somnalu [[DATABASE/action/Burrow|Burrows]] three times. It digs a trench along its path, filling the trench with acid pumped from its skin. The trench is hazardous terrain, and any creature that moves into it takes 4d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent acid damage]]. While Burrowing, if Somnalu would move through a space occupied by another creature, that creature must attempt a DC 36 Reflex save to avoid falling into the trench and taking the acid damage. The acid remains for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Digestive Secretions** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Somnalu secretes acid for 1 round. Whenever it makes a melee Strike, it deals an additional 2d8 acid splash damage. Like most splash damage, this damage applies to the target and adjacent creatures and applies even on a failure, though not on a critical failure.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drain Nutrients** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Somnalu targets a creature with a claw Strike. On a success, Somnalu drains the creature's life through its skin. The creature must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]] (drained 1 on a success, no effect on a critical success). Somnalu gains temporary Hit Points equal to the amount of Hit Points the creature loses from this Strike.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vent Fumes** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Somnalu blasts poison gas in a 30-foot radius. The gas lingers for 1 round, and all creatures that begin their turn in the gas or enter the gas take 4d8 poison damage (DC 36 basic Fortitude save). Any creature in the gas is [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and other creatures are concealed to all creatures in the gas. However, Somnalu can see through this concealment.</span>
