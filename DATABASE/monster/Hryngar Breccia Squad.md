# Hryngar Breccia Squad

A hryngar breccia squad is a group of hryngar martial combatants armed with melee weapons and steel shields. Though more likely to be encountered near large hryngar settlements, these strike forces see wide use throughout the Darklands. Hryngar breccia squads often serve as military units, mercenary companies, city patrols, and caravan guards. Like all warriors, the favored combat methods of a hryngar breccia squad change by location, often due to surrounding environment and popular equipment.

**Speed** 20 feet; troop movement
<span class="in-box-ability">**Bolt Barrage** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The hryngar breccia squad draws or reloads its crossbows, then launches a ranged attack in the form of a volley. This volley is a 10-foot burst within 120 feet that deals 4d8 piercing damage (DC 28 basic Reflex save). When the hryngar breccia squad is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Form Up|Form Up]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> </span><span class="in-box-ability">**General Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> to <span class="action-icon">3</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The hryngar breccia squad engages in a coordinated attack with its melee weapons against each enemy within 5 feet (DC 28 basic Reflex save).

This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the hryngar breccia squad enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the entire hryngar breccia squad.</span>

###  Rift Jumpers

Hryngar breccia squads that specialize in spelunking are known as Rift Jumpers, named for their reckless leaps into perilous chasms. They swap their shields and warhammers for [[DATABASE/weapon/Light Pick|light picks]] and train with their climbing equipment until it serves as an extension of their body. Rift Jumpers lose the Raise Shields, Shield Block, and Push Back actions, and gain a climb Speed of 20 feet.
