# Ghonhatine

In transforming [[Xulgath]], [[Drow]] fleshwarpers sought not to create a new type of creature but to recapture a form of xulgath predecessor believed entirely vanished from Golarion. Ghonhatines are the result—hulking reptilian beasts who prefer to crawl on all fours and tear at their foes with bestial fury.

###  Zevgavizeb's Favored

The demonic patron of many [[Xulgath]], [[Zevgavizeb]], spends most of his time slumbering in the Abyssal realm of Gluttondark. However, his vile priests actively pursue what they insist are their dormant god's goals. Some xulgath high priests practice fleshwarping upon their own acolytes, creating [[Ghonhatine]] zealots to serve in their legions and guard their evil temples.
