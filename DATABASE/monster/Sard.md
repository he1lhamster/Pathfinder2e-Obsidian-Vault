# Sard

An immense, gnarled, tree awoken with raw, primal power by one of the fey Eldest of the First World, this monster—one of the legendary Tane—skitters on huge, spidery roots and thrashes its branches as fiery lightning courses within its blackened bark, a living manifestation of the violent clash between ancient forest and stormy sky.

###  The Witch-Tree

The first sard was created when the Eldest known as [[DATABASE/deity/The Green Mother|the Green Mother]] beckoned the sky's rage to strike the eldest oak in her domain, transforming the tree into a living siege engine. This original sard still stands sentinel in the Hanging Bower of the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]].
