<span class="in-box-ability">**Tick Tock Tick Tock** (auditory, aura, divine, enchantment, mental, sonic) 30 feet. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, the constant clicking and ticking sounds coming from Ticktock worm into its thoughts and fill the listener with the sense that time is speeding up for everyone but itself. The creature must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or become [[Slowed]] (or slowed 2 on a critical failure) until the end of its next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Attack of Opportunity]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** </span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Shadow Scream** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (aura, concentrate, darkness, divine, evocation, mental, sonic) The sacristan opens their mouth to unloose a series of thunderous clicking sounds. This creates a 30-foot emanation of darkness and wailing sounds around the sacristan. Creatures with [[Darkvision]] can't see through this darkness. The sacristan can Sustain Shadow Scream for up to 1 minute. Non-[[Velstrac]] creatures in the area when the ability is used, as well as those who enter or start their turn in the area, must attempt a DC 37 Will save.

 **Success** The creature is [[Deafened]] for 1 round.
 **Failure** The creature is [[Confused]] and deafened for 1 round.
 **Critical Failure** The creature takes 20 mental damage, and is confused and deafened for 1 round.</span>
