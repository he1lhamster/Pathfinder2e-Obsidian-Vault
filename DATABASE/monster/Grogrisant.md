# Grogrisant

Grogrisant is an enormous lion with multiple eyes and a golden, glowing mane. As it was originally slain by Taldor's founding emperor, the legendary hero Taldaris, Grogrisant's appearance marks both danger for the people of Taldor and the potential for Taldans to prove their might against a creature from their fabled past. How it continues to appear time and time again remains a mystery, one that Taldan scholars continuously attempt to decipher.
