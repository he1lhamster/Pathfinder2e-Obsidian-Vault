# Ghul

Legends claim the gods banished a number of evil, greedy, and gluttonous [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Genie|genies]] to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] in the early days of creation. There, the genies transformed into the first ghuls, cruel undead that feast on the flesh of the living. The greedy and gluttonous nature of the first ghuls lives on, cursing them with an insatiable need to consume. Ghuls haunt trade routes, cemeteries, and other locations with good hiding places and a regular influx of travelers. From here, ghuls use their abilities to confuse and captivate passersby, luring them toward dens where ghuls can feast on unsuspecting flesh. Unlike a ghoul, a ghul doesn't devour corpses—only live prey.

The grabbed creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] (or drained 2 if the jaws Strike was a critical success). The violent consumption requires the ghul to release the creature as it feasts. A ghul can regain Hit Points from consuming the flesh of a given creature only once per hour; it must consume the flesh of a different creature to gain additional Hit Points during this time.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Luring Laugh** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal) **Requirements** The ghul is in its hyena shape; **Effect** The ghul lets out an alluring chitter. Each creature in a 60-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]], [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], and compelled to move toward the ghul on the creature's turn. The effect lasts until the end of the ghul's next turn, but the ghul can Sustain a Spell on Luring Laugh. If the ghul attacks, the fascinated condition ends for only the creature that's attacked. On a successful save, a creature is temporarily immune to Luring Laugh for 24 hours.</span>

###  Genie Connections

Though they're no longer true [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Genie|genies]], ghuls derive a number of their abilities from their genie origins. It's said ghuls can transform into hyenas because of a desperate wish the first ghuls made as they transformed. Ghuls retain knowledge of the elemental tongues, with most ghuls able to speak one of the following: [[DATABASE/language/Aquan|Aquan]], [[DATABASE/language/Auran|Auran]], [[DATABASE/language/Ignan|Ignan]], [[DATABASE/language/Terran|Terran]], or another planar language.
