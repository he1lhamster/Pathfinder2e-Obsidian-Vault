# Vilderavn Herald

In its true form, a vilderavn herald is a [[Human]]-sized raven. Its ability to assume a humanoid guise suits it to insinuate itself into the retinue of a mortal ruler or to travel without too much concern, but more often these deadly fey directly serve more powerful rulers, such as the Eldest.

As [[Frightful Presence]], plus a creature [[Frightened]] by the aura becomes suspicious: it doesn't count any other creature as its ally, and it can't [[Aid]] or flank. On a critical failure, the creature also can't be a willing target for harmless or helpful magic. The vilderavn can activate or deactivate this aura using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Attack of Opportunity]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** </span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bloodbird** (curse, occult) A creature hit by a vilderavn's melee attack becomes cursed, taking 2d6 [[Persistent Damage]] that's difficult to stanch: the DC to stop the bleeding using [[Administer First Aid]] is 35, and healing the creature to full HP doesn't automatically end the bleeding. Removing the curse ends the bleeding.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The vilderavn takes on the shape of a [[Wolf]] or [[Dire Wolf]], a wolf-raven hybrid, or its raven knight form: a Small or Medium humanoid in black full plate carrying a greatsword. The vilderavn can use its jaws attack only in a form that has a wolf's head, its talon attack only in a form that has raven talons, and its greatsword only in raven knight form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Souleater** (necromancy, occult) If the vilderavn kills a humanoid target with a critical hit using its jaws Strike, it rips out and devours the target's heart and soul as part of the attack. While the target is dead, the vilderavn can Change Shape into the target's form, gaining a +4 status bonus to [[Deception]] checks to [[Impersonate]] the target. If magic would resurrect the creature, the caster must succeed at a DC 38 counteract check to extract the target's soul from the vilderavn; otherwise the spell fails.</span>

###  Other Vilderavns

**Warning - this sidebar contains spoilers for the Kingmaker adventure path.**
The vilderavn heralds in Kingmaker serve the Lantern King, and are more powerful than others of their kind. The typical [[Vilderavn]] is a 16th-level monster.
