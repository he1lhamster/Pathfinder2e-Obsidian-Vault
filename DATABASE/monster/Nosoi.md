# Nosoi

A nosoi resembles a whippoorwill, sparrow, or other small bird wearing a heavy leather plague doctor’s mask. They are the clerks, messengers, and scribes of the Boneyard, witnessing judgments, directing souls, and generally performing the administrative grunt work that keeps the Boneyard functioning. Most nosois are particularly chatty and eager to discuss how important they consider their individual assignments to be.

Each living or undead creature within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a DC 18 Will save. The effect lasts for 1 round, but a nosoi can use this ability again on subsequent rounds to extend the duration by 1 round for all affected creatures. A creature that succeeds at any save is temporarily immune for 24 hours. Despite being a mental effect, this ability affects mindless undead. Psychopomps are immune to this ability.
 **Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]].
 **Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature must spend each of its actions on its turn to move closer to the nosoi as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] creature is adjacent to the nosoi, it stays still and doesn’t act. If the creature is attacked, the fascination ends.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spirit Touch** A nosoi’s Strikes affect incorporeal creatures as though etched with a [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] property rune and deal 1d6 negative damage to living creatures or 1d6 positive damage to undead.</span>
