# Bog Strider

The insectile bog striders call themselves seshes, but they take no offense at those who use the more common vernacular to refer to them. They resemble upright water striders with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. Bog striders can move about on water like solid ground, chasing down prey or fleeing from predators across the water. They rarely leave the swampy rivers and lakes they call home. Bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. 
A bog strider's diet consists almost entirely of meat, but they prefer to feed only on animals, as they consider the consumption of the flesh of any sapient creature a taboo.
In sesh society, each individual is expected to serve equally in all efforts to ensure the society's survival against the more aggressive creatures often found in or near their swampland homes. In addition, each member of the community is expected to develop a skill that contributes to the community's prosperity, and by extension, the continued survival of the species. Traditionally, female bog striders are builders and artisans while males are hunters and gatherers, but often such roles aren't limited to a single gender, as every member of a small community pitches in to help as they can.

###  Tremor Tapping

Seshes can communicate with other bog striders via [[DATABASE/monsterability/Wavesense|wavesense]] by tapping at a water surface they're standing upon. Other creatures with wavesense can detect these tappings, but understanding them is typically beyond non-seshes. A GM might allow a character who has wavesense, can speak [[DATABASE/language/Aquan|Aquan]], and spends a significant amount of time living among bog striders to understand tremor tapping or to communicate via this unusual method.
