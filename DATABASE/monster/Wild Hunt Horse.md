# Wild Hunt Horse

These steeds stand upon puffs of air, their grassy manes and tails swishing majestically in the wind. When they are not participating in a hunt, wild hunt horses enjoy constructing complicated courses through land and sky and racing each other for ever-changing stakes.

Those who meet the gaze of a wild hunt horse come face-to-face with the hunt's fearful power and find it difficult to act in the face of such a legendary legacy. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must succeed at a DC 31 Will save to resist becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] (slowed 2 on a critical failure). The wild hunt horse can deactivate or activate this aura by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bewildering Hoofbeats** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (auditory, aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) The wild hunt horse stamps its hooves and prances in place, creating the sound of hundreds of horses apparently approaching from all directions. Each creature within 60 feet must attempt a DC 33 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Bewildering Hoofbeats for 1 hour.
 **Success** The creature is distracted by the sound. Until the start of the creature's next turn, if it attempts to use a reaction, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the reaction is disrupted, wasted with no effect.
 **Failure** The creature is bewildered by the sound, with the same effects as success except it is also [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the confusion effect persists for 1 minute or until the creature recovers by other means.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Deafening Cry** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, evocation, primal, sonic) The wild hunt horse gives out a thundering cry in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 16d6 sonic damage (DC 36 basic Fortitude save, plus deafened for 1 minute on a critical failure). The wild hunt horse can't use Deafening Cry again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Focus Gaze** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual) The wild hunt horse fixes its glare at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a Will save against the wild hunt horse's wild gaze. If the creature was already [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] by the wild gaze before attempting its save, a failed save causes it to be [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to Focus Gaze from any wild hunt until the start of the wild hunt horse's next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Trample|Trample]]** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Medium or smaller, hoof, DC 36.</span>
