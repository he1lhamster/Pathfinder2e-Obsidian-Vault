# Formian Queen

The formian queen is the center of the formian hive. The queen identifies and attends to the hive's needs, laying egg clusters that vary from a single formian born to a particular task to hundreds of workers at a time. All formians are born with an instinctive deference for the queen that borders on slavish devotion, though this urge can be corrupted, as with the King of Biting Ants' mutant mageslayers.

**Hive Mind** (divination, primal) Formians operate from a shared hive intelligence that allows them to communicate nearly instantaneously. While within telepathic range of at least one other formian from the same hive mind, a formian worker gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative checks, Perception checks, and saving throws against mental effects. If one formian is aware of a combatant, all members of the hive mind within range are aware of it.

Each affected formian gains the [[Quickened]] condition for 1 minute, and can use the extra action each round only to Strike or Stride.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Possess Formian** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession, primal) A formian queen transfers her consciousness to the body of any formian within range of her telepathy to whom she has a line of effect. As long as the queen's consciousness is outside her body, her body is [[Unconscious]] (though she is aware if any damage is dealt to it). An unwilling target can attempt a DC 38 Will saving throw to resist being possessed, but the queen's offspring are part of her hive mind and thus are almost always willing. The queen receives all sensory input from the target creature; she can speak through it, and she can use her own modifier for Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks. If the target creature is slain or moves to a different plane from the queen's body, the queen returns to her own body immediately and is [[Stunned]]; otherwise, she can return to her own body as a free action, ending the possession effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Telepathic Feedback** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (enchantment, mental, primal) The formian queen unleashes a blast of debilitating telepathic feedback, targeting as many creatures as she wishes within range of her telepathy and to whom she has a line of effect. Targeted creatures must attempt a DC 38 Will save. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Telepathic Feedback for 24 hours. 
**Success** The creature takes 3d6 mental damage, 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]], and is sickened 1. 
**Failure** The creature takes 6d6 mental damage, 1d6 persistent mental damage, and is [[Sickened]]. 
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 12d6 mental damage, 1d6 persistent mental damage, and is [[Stunned]]. Upon recovering from the stunned condition, the creature becomes sickened 2.</span>
