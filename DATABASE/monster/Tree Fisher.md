The tree fisher can move while it has a creature grabbed with its filament, but automatically releases the [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grab]] if the tree fisher moves beyond the filament's 60-foot length. A creature grabbed by the filament at the beginning of its turn takes 5 bleed damage.
 The tree fisher can sever the filament and release any creature grabbed by it as a free action. The filament can be severed by a Strike that deals at least 10 slashing damage to it. This doesn't deal any damage to the tree fisher itself. The filament has AC 17, and its [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC is 19.
 The tree fisher has only one harpoon; if the filament is severed, the tree fisher loses this ability and its ranged attack for 1 week as it fashions a new harpoon.</span>
