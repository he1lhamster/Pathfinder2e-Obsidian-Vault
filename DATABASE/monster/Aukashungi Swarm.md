<span class="in-box-ability">**Burrowing Agony** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The swarm deals 4d6 piercing damage and 2d4 persistent bleed damage to every creature in its space (DC 29 basic Reflex save). The first time per round that a creature is affected by an aukashungi swarm's Burrowing Agony, the creature is also exposed to expeditious evolution.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Expeditious Evolution** (curse, disease) This affliction can't be reduced below stage 1, nor the damage from it healed, until successfully treated with [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Curse|remove curse]] or a similar effect; the affliction can then be removed as normal for a disease. **Saving Throw** DC 27 Fortitude; **Stage 1** The aukashungi swarm chooses two of the victim's ability modifiers (such as Strength and Charisma). The victim gains a +1 status bonus to any skill checks that use those ability modifiers. The victim takes a –1 status penalty to all other skill checks (1 day); **Stage 2** The status penalty increases to –2 (1 day); **Stage 3** The status bonus increases to +2, and the penalty increases to –3 (1 day); **Stage 4** The status penalty increases to –4 (1 day).</span>
