# Rotbomber

Disgusting and dangerous, rotbombers bound around on all four limbs, ripping off the pressurized and explosive necrotic pustules that grow out of their backs to lob them toward their enemies. When they explode, the pustules emit concussive blasts of force and deadly pestilence that can infect a victim. Though slow and overburdened by the intense weight of the pustules, rotbombers can move with a surprising speed when they need to hunt down their quarry.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Pressurized Pustules** When a rotbomber takes acid, fire, physical or sonic damage, there is a chance a prematurely developed pustule bursts open, determined by a DC 11 flat check. All creatures in a 10-foot emanation must succeed at DC 29 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 2]]. A creature that gets a critical failure becomes sickened 3. Any creature who attempts this save becomes temporarily immune to pressurized pustules for 24 hours.</span>

The rotbomber [[DATABASE/action/Leap|Leaps]] up to 15 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically to land in a square adjacent to a target creature and makes a necrotic pustule Strike against the target. If the Strike hits, it deals an additional 4d6 bludgeoning damage to the target.

###  Rotbomber Variants

**Warning - this sidebar contains spoilers for the Blood Lords adventure path.**
Though the stat block presented for the rotbomber represents the most common version of the creature, GMs can feel free to experiment within the paradigms of the campaign to produce their own variants if they wish. For example, the Church of [[DATABASE/deity/Urgathoa|Urgathoa]] magically treats the [[DATABASE/equipment/Shadow Ash|shadow ash]] discovered by the player characters in chapter three to create frostbombers, whose necrotic pustules deal cold damage instead of negative damage. Such rotbomber variants can easily be made to harm foes with fire, electricity, sonic vibrations, or any other damage type the GM deems appropriate.
