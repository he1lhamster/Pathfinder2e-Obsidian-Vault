# Jinkin

Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great pride in their power to curse precious objects. They hold grudges and create convoluted plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as when a creature dares to remove one of their curses. Rarely content to wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also take immense pleasure in torture and murder, though they prefer to lead victims into traps designed to capture or incapacitate rather than kill outright. Deep pits are favorites, since victims who survive the fall face a slow death from starvation and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.

While this process is lengthy, it’s also unobtrusive and can be performed while Hiding. Jinkins prefer to use this ability on magic items. The curse makes the item unreliable (DC 5 flat check or waste any action to Interact with or Activate the item), adds a bizarre requirement to use the item, or imparts some other curse of a similar caliber.</span>
