description: "Arboreal wardens are the rangers of arboreal society. These itinerant\
  \ folk have an innate curiosity about the woodlands in which they dwell, and rarely\
  \ stop to take root and rest in the same part of the forest twice. This wanderlust\
  \ makes wardens ideal forest patrollers and scouts. While they are robust combatants,\
  \ they know better than to confront dangerous foes on their own. Instead, they report\
  \ any dangers to arboreal regents. In rare cases, large groups of arboreal wardens\
  \ congregate to form a copse. Copses travel beyond the boundaries of a forest to\
  \ investigate the hinterlands and gather intelligence on potential threats before\
  \ returning to report their findings. Arboreal wardens do not pretend to understand\
  \ to other creatures\u2019 motives\u2014like most forces of the natural world, they\
  \ are ambivalent about mortal affairs that do not involve their forest.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Ardande

Ardandes are geniekin whose elemental birthright ties them to the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]]. Their elemental connection can take many different forms, all expressions of the different types and permutations of elemental wood. They might embody the life and vibrancy of a seedling, full of potential and ready to grow. Or, they could be strong and flexible, like the branches and roots of ancient trees, interconnected and all growing together. They could also possess power over death and decay, like decomposing logs ready to fertilize and feed the next generation.
 Common on the Plane of Wood, uncommon in the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]], and only on the cusp of a resurgence into the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Universe]], the ardandes often feel misplaced in the multiverse, born into the wrong place or the wrong time. Many spend their lives searching the planes for answers about themselves and their heritage.
 Ardandes are found in all major cities and civilizations on the Plane of Wood, though most live in Nodollin, the Glowing Infinity, a metropolis controlled by the powerful [[DATABASE/monster/Kizidhar|kizidhars]]. Some ardandes say life in Nodollin is filled with infantilization and belittlement from the kizidhars, the wood genies who rule the land and much of the plane. The kizidhars largely view ardandes as genies like them, but a lesser form of genie that ranks below kizidhar commoners in the same way they are lesser to the shuyookhs. Though a few ardandes rebel against this social order, the weight of culture tells them hierarchies are natural to the element of wood, and they should accept their place even if they chafe.
 Many planar ardandes moved to Shodokar when the new city was founded, hoping the influx of portals leading out of the Plane of Wood would let them visit the rest of the multiverse and learn about their lost mortal heritage. They delight in meeting visitors and showing off the beauty and wonders of their home plane. Some have even moved to the Universe, and they make invaluable mentors for the new ardandes only just discovering their elemental potential across Golarion.

###  First World Ardande

Some ardandes are born in the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]], the children of [[DATABASE/monster/Dryad|dryads]] who take mortal lovers. These ardandes have little contact with other mortals and think of themselves as elemental fey rather than planar scions, a reasonable perspective when life in the First World means severance from the River of Souls.
