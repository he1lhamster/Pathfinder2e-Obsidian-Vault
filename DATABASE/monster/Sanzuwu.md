# Sanzuwu

Those who feast on the sun are said to carry its power within them. Sanzuwus are small crows with red plumage and dark throats. According to legend, they stole their burning power from the sun and now fly across the sky as blinding streaks of fire. When they land on the earth, it ignites around them, causing unbound destruction. A handful of people worship these radiant birds and inscribe their three-legged visage on coins, items, and weapons.

###  A Fiery Murder

When several sanzuwus are together the immense heat radiating from them can cause an inferno of devastation. Legends tell of sanzuwus gathered together as the ground rends into volcanic rifts and uncontrollable blazes. Though they bring destruction in their wake, some stories claim that a brave individual who can follow these cataclysmic rifts for 10 days will reach the sun and earn its blessing
