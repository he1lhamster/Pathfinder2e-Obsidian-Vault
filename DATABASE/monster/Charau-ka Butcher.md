# Charau-ka Butcher

While charau-ka are infamous for their brutality, some even frighten their own kind in their obsession with violence. These deadly butchers are well-versed in the art of inflicting vicious, bloody wounds on their enemies, and they consider anyone not charau-ka an enemy. A single taste of a foe's blood can grant one terrifying strength, as if the charau-ka butcher literally gains power from their victims' pain.
