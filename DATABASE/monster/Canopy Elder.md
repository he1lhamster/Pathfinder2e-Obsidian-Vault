# Canopy Elder

In the densest and oldest jungles, arboreals can reach heights of 200 feet or more. Given thousands of undisturbed years, these massive creatures enter into a symbiotic relationship with a myriad of plants, fungi, and animals to achieve the esteemed status of canopy elder. They provide a safe home for the creatures they host and develop a variety of powers that help them defend their forest realms.

Creatures inside the cloud become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it.

###  Canopy Elder Allies

Epiphytes, hallucinogenic mushrooms, carnivorous orchids, and stinging insects all call a canopy elder home, as might larger creatures such as primates, big cats, birds, bats, and snakes. Many of these residents will take great pains to defend their home from threats.
