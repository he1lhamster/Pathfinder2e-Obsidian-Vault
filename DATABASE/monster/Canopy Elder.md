# Canopy Elder

In the densest and oldest jungles, arboreals can reach heights of 200 feet or more. Given thousands of undisturbed years, these massive creatures enter into a symbiotic relationship with a myriad of plants, fungi, and animals to achieve the esteemed status of canopy elder. They provide a safe home for the creatures they host and develop a variety of powers that help them defend their forest realms.

Creatures inside the cloud become [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. Non-plant and non-fungus creatures within the cloud must attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [[Sickened]], and on a critical failure the creature is also [[Blinded]] for 1 minute. Regardless of the result, a creature is then temporarily immune to the sickening and blinding effects of the canopy elder's pollen for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vine Splint** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (healing) The canopy elder grows a mesh of vines around its broken branches, repairing the damage and restoring 40 HP to itself.

###  Canopy Elder Allies

Epiphytes, hallucinogenic mushrooms, carnivorous orchids, and stinging insects all call a canopy elder home, as might larger creatures such as primates, big cats, birds, bats, and snakes. Many of these residents will take great pains to defend their home from threats.
