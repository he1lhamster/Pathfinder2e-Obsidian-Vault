<span class="in-box-ability">**Abyssal Link** The Demongate Colossus is built around a seething, churning mass of [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyssal]] energy that looks like a sphere of electrified red mist encompassing a single floating harrow card at its center—[[DATABASE/equipment/The Survivor|The Survivor]]. The Abyssal link is obscured until the Demongate Colossus is reduced to fewer than 120 Hit Points, at which point glimpses of it become visible through tears and holes in its leathery “flesh.” The potent magic drawn from this card, combined with the radiant warden's gatewarper aura, is what allowed the Prince of Wolves to invade [[DATABASE/plane/The Harrow Court|Harrow Court]]. Once the Abyssal link is revealed, a character can attempt to counter the Abyssal link with a [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (7th level; counteract DC 34), or can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]] the card with a DC 35 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (master) check (on a failure, a thief attempting to Steal the card takes 5d10 chaotic and 5d10 evil damage—this damage is doubled on a critical failure). Either success causes a link collapse (see below).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Gatewarper Aura** (abjuration, aura, occult) 60 feet. A creature that uses a teleportation ability within the aura's emanation or enters the emanation via a teleportation ability must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] (drained 2 on a critical failure) as its body warps and distorts painfully, and have its destination changed to a point of the radiant warden's choosing within the emanation.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Link Collapse** If the Demongate Colossus is destroyed or its belly portal is deactivated, demons that used the colossus's portal within a 40-foot emanation take 7d10 good damage (basic DC 30 Fortitude save). A creature that takes full or double damage is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute. If the Demongate Colossus is still active when it suffers a link collapse, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 3]] and loses its gatewarper aura.</span>

On a critical failure, the creature is also [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]].</span>
