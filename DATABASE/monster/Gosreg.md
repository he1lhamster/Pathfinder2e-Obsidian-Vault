# Gosreg

Gosregs are agents of the Dominion of the Black that insinuate themselves into humanoid societies to foster the goals of their sinister alien masters. They act as spies and special forces that can mingle with humanoid society while enacting plans for the rest of the Dominion in secret.
 In their natural forms, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to their stumpy legs and gangly arms. They take on the appearances of humanoids to infiltrate societies, and they drop their disguises only when they feel they are ultimately compromised and must resort to physical violence to protect their agendas. Their brain-like heads and bestial legs suggest a potential link with a similar Dominion of the Black agent: the dreaded [[DATABASE/monster/Intellect Devourer|intellect devourer]].

###  Dominion Plots

While Golarion largely survived the events of the Doomsday Dawn, the threat of the Dominion of the Black is far from over. This alien conglomerate recognizes that it needs to understand the vastness of humanoids in the universe to better enact their plans, and certain nihilistic scholars suggest that the Doomsday Dawn was never intended to end the world, but instead served its primary goal of setting the stage for an even more devastating invasion from the Dominion in the near future.
