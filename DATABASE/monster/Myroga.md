# Myroga

Myrogas are avaricious, simple-minded dragons with supernatural occult powers. They draw their amazing abilities from ley lines—loci of intense magical energy often associated with psychic phenomena.
 A myroga encountered away from a ley line is far less dangerous, a fact which myrogas recognize and take great pains to mitigate. Upon discovering an unoccupied ley line, a myroga is apt to roost nearby and guard the site ferociously. All the while, it sups on the ley line's nearly inexhaustible ambient magic to grow stronger and expand its repertoire of brutal powers.

###  Myroga Hoards

Like most dragons, myrogas often amass sizeable hoards of treasure in the course of their long, violent lives. A myroga's treasures tend to be eccentric and strange. Powerful crystal balls, cursed suits of armor, and intelligent talking weapons are among the most commonplace treasures found in a myroga's hoard of wonders.
