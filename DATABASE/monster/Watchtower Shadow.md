**HP** 190 (rejuvenation); **Immunities** death effects, disease, [[Paralyzed]], poison, precision, [[Unconscious]]; **Resistances** all 15 (except force, [[Ghost Touch]], or positive; double resistance against non-magical); **Weaknesses** light vulnerability
<span class="in-box-ability">**Light Vulnerability** An object shedding magical light (such as from the [[Light]] spell) is treated as magical when used to attack the shadow.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rejuvenation** (necromancy, occult) When the watchtower shadow is destroyed, it re-forms, fully healed, at the watchtower after 12 hours. Destroying the shadow and lighting its watchtower's brazier permanently destroys it.</span>

**Speed** fly 30 feet
<span class="in-box-ability">**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> shadow hand +30 [+25/+20] (finesse, magical), **Damage** 4d10+10 negative</span>**Divine Innate Spells** DC 36; **5th** _[[Darkness]]_ (at will)
<span class="in-box-ability">**Shadow Spawn** When a creature's shadow is pulled free by Steal Shadow, it becomes a shadow spawn under the command of the shadow that created it. This shadow spawn doesn't have Steal Shadow and is perpetually and incurably [[Clumsy]]. If the creature the shadow spawn was pulled from dies, the shadow spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous shadow. If the creature recovers from its enfeeblement, its shadow returns to it and the shadow spawn is extinguished.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Slink in Shadows** The shadow can [[Hide]] or end its [[Sneak]] in a creature's or object's shadow.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Steal Shadow** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, necromancy) **Requirement** The shadow hit a living creature with a shadow hand Strike on its previous action. **Effect** The shadow pulls at the target's shadow, making the creature [[Enfeebled]]. This is cumulative with other enfeebled conditions from shadows, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If this increases a creature's enfeebled value to 3 or more, the target's shadow is separated from its body (see shadow spawn). Enfeebled from Steal Shadow decreases by 1 every hour.</span>
