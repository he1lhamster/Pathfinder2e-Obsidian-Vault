# Nanoshard Swarm

This bizarre entity is actually a massive collective consisting of tens of thousands of constituent parts, each a tiny metal sphere barely the size of a pebble. Controlled by a single elemental spirit, the swarm is capable of flowing like liquid through the smallest openings before shaping itself into a powerful combatant, a solid wall, or any other form circumstances might require.

The wall can follow any path, with each 5 feet being placed on the border between squares. It doesn't need to stand vertically, so it can form a bridge or set of stairs, for example. The wall must be formed in an unbroken open space where its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects.
 A single 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall can be destroyed by dealing 18 points of damage to it, which also reduces the swarm's total Hit Points. A nanoshard swarm can't be knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] or forcibly moved while in barrier form, nor can it voluntarily move. A nanoshard swarm in barrier form can originate tendril attacks from any square of its wall.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Battle Form** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate, polymorph) **Requirements** The nanoshard swarm is in swarm form; **Effect** The nanoshard swarm coalesces into a Huge shape that looks like a humanoid or beast and can hold items.

###  Some Reassembly Required

Nanoshard swarms are notoriously difficult to permanently dismantle. Should even a single constituent of a swarm manage to escape destruction, the minuscule elemental immediately seeks out the nearest source of raw metal and begins extracting material in order to create as many exact duplicates of itself as possible. Each subsequent duplicate then dutifully repeats the same behavior, doubling the number of constituents every few minutes, until the entire swarm has been fully reconstituted.
