# Jabali Shuyookh

A jabali genie of great power and high social rank is called a shuyookh. Strong in body and mind, jabali shuyookhs value physical skill, fine artistry, and displays of strength. Incredibly proud, they're easily offended and quick to anger but lash out only after weighing the consequences. Shuyookhs view their desires as greater than those around them, leading them to provide aid as quickly and efficiently as possible, fulfilling the terms of bargains expediently and to the letter.
 Jabali shuyookhs are industrious and have many interests, including athletic competitions, engineering, jewelry-making, masonry, metalworking, and sculpting. They enjoy games of chance and bargaining, whether in a gambling hall, arena, or marketplace. Some mix their interests by managing organizations or guilds involving such concerns. Many shuyookhs reap the wealth of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] for sale elsewhere and speculate on the value of such commodities.

###  Industry Titans

The mercantile empires of jabali shuyookhs extend across the Plane of Earth and onto other planes. Jabalis especially like to trade in regions of the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Universe]] and across the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]]. Many customers value gemstones, metals, and other precious materials mined on the Plane of Earth. Thus, the resources of the Plane of Earth feed industry across the planes.
