# Giant Toad

Most giant toads live in dry environments, particularly deserts, and eagerly eat almost any creature smaller than themselves. They're known to eat giant rats, then take over the rats' burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This leads to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly explode if left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests, some groups of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ogre|ogres]] and [[DATABASE/monster/Hill Giant|hill giants]] cultivate them to collect their poison for recreational use.

###  Frogs and Toads

While they might look similar in appearance, toads and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Frog|frogs]] are quite different creatures, particularly some of their oversized variants. Frogs tend to dwell in swampy or marshy areas, while toads are found in drier regions like forests, plains, grasslands, and deserts. Monstrous toads also skew to a larger size overall.
