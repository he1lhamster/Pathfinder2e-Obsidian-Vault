**Children of the Night** (divine, enchantment, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include [[DATABASE/monster/Rat Swarm|rat swarms]], bat swarms, and [[DATABASE/monster/Wolf|wolves]], but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Mist Escape** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. **Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it’s at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) Giant bat with fangs +19 for 2d8+9 piercing.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Create Spawn** (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator’s control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire’s Will DC.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Dominate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] (DC 26) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drain Bonded Item** <span class="action-icon">4</span> (arcane, wizard) **Frequency** Once per day. **Requirements** The vampire hasn’t acted yet on this turn. **Effect** The vampire expends the power stored in its signet ring. This gives the vampire the ability to cast one prepared spell it had already previously cast today, without spending a spell slot. The vampire must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell’s other requirements.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drink Blood** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, necromancy) **Requirement** A [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. **Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]] and the vampire regains 10 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.
 A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Steady Spellcasting** If another creature’s reaction would disrupt the vampire mastermind’s spellcasting action, the vampire attempts a DC 15 flat check. If the vampire succeeds, its action isn’t disrupted.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Turn to Mist** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.</span>
