Where unusual materials are available, an improvised projectile might deal damage other than bludgeoning or piercing—for example, a morlock engineer by a campfire could build a projectile that deals fire damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]** The morlock deals an extra 1d6 precision damage to [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] creatures.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Swarming Stance** A morlock can share the same space as another morlock, but no more than two morlocks can occupy the same space. When morlocks share the same space, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Uncanny Tinker** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The morlock engineer tinkers with an adjacent construct or mechanical hazard. They attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check against the construct's or hazard's Fortitude DC. The morlock can't get an outcome better than failure if the target's level is more than double the morlock's. This ability reflects hasty battlefield repairs; once a construct or hazard regains Hit Points from this ability, it can't do so again until it's been [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repaired]]. 
**Critical Success** The target regains 8d6 Hit Points and a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls for 1 minute. Alternately, the morlock can deal 8d6 damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as chosen by the morlock engineer) to the construct or hazard. 
**Success** As critical success, but the target regains 4d6 Hit Points or the morlock deals 4d6 damage. 
**Critical Failure** The morlock injures themself, taking 3d6 damage (typically bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, but potentially a different type at the GM's discretion).</span>
