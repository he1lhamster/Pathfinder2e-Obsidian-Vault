# Crownbound Constellation

Crownbound constellations are the essence of stars granted sentience by the goddess [[Desna]], who created them to survey the vastness of space and help her craft the galaxy. Their intergalactic travels once took them far, but [[Lamashtu]] sought to ensnare Desna's creation. The Mother of Beasts lured them to Golarion and then, exploiting the power of Golarion's sun, corrupted their ability to star travel. Stranded on the planet and unable to bear sunlight, these creatures traveled to the Crown of the World, where they have settled ever since.

It can use Swarm Shape again to coalesce back into its normal form, at which point its star weapons reappear.</span>

###  An Eon's Loing memory

Crownbound constellations have not forgotten [[Lamashtu]] deception, or the commission set for them by [[Desna]]. Crownbound constellations frequently attack those they assume to be in league with the Mother of Monsters, and their hatred for her has severed their connection to Desna, just as Lamashtu planned.
