# Dweomercat

Dweomercats are magically gifted felines from the First World, where they prey upon other creatures and feed upon their primal energy. They are sometimes encountered in areas of the Material Plane where the veil to the First World is thin, or in regions where magic has been irreparably warped. Dweomercats are famous for their ability to twist the metaphorical strings of spells cast on or near them, which they can transform into their own defensive magic or tap into to instantly teleport across the battlefield.

###  Dweomercat Familiars

Particularly powerful spellcasters sometimes take young dweomercat cubs as familiars. Their independence and flightiness makes dweomercats somewhat unreliable allies, though, so one is never sure whether their bond with a dweomercat will be long-lasting or a temporary affair.
