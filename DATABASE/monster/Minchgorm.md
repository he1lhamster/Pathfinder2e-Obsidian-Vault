# Minchgorm

An oddity even among the strange creatures of the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]] of the fey, the aquatic minchgorm is a monstrous alien maw ringed with writhing tendrils. It interacts with the world through grasping, speaking simulacra that it magically shapes from water.

A simulacrum can take any shape of size Medium or smaller that the minchgorm desires, including that of a specific individual or object, but is always plainly made of water. The minchgorm can speak, cast spells, and use its senses through its simulacra, spending actions for a simulacrum on a one-for-one basis. By using a single action with the concentrate trait, the minchgorm can cause any number of simulacra to [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]], Step, Stride, or [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]] up to 60 feet. A simulacrum uses the minchgorm's AC and saving throws and has 30 Hit Points. A minchgorm can have up to eight simulacra in existence at once. Simulacra dissolve immediately when more than 60 feet from the minchgorm, or if the minchgorm dies or falls unconscious. The minchgorm can dismiss any number of its simulacra as a free action.</span>

###  Monstrous Esthetes

Despite its aberrant appearance, a minchgorm considers itself a creature of refined tastes, exhibiting a love of poetry and other vocal performances. Solitary minchgorms often entertain themselves by staging elaborate recitals and productions cast entirely with their own simulacra.
