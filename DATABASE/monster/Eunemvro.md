# Eunemvro

Eunemvros wander the [[Material Plane]] with the sole purpose of destroying undead. These mysterious beings claim to hail from the [[Positive Energy Plane]], although they have no direct evidence of their supposedly otherworldly origins other than their unusual appearance: tall, lean humanoids with an okapi's head. If they truly hail from the Positive Energy Plane, they don't seem to have any method to return there and have made their home on the Material Plane—a home, unfortunately, infested by the unnatural living dead.
 Beings composed or animated by negative energy—including lowly [[Skeleton]] and [[Zombie]] as well as [[Wight]] and [[Ghoul]]—rightly fear confrontation with a eunemvro, for few other creatures possess innate abilities so perfectly suited for the eradication of such monsters with but a touch. In addition to magical abilities, eunemvros are adept martial artists whose mighty fists and feet channel the force of positive energy with every blow.
 Most of these solitary hunters believe mortals incapable of comprehending their cosmic mandate, though they themselves only understand this drive as a directive instilled in them by the strange powers that sent them to the Material Plane. If pressed, some eunemvro might grudgingly accept aid from those who have proven capable of slaying the undead.

The eunemvro creates either a 10- foot cone or a 30-foot line, dealing 6d8 positive damage (DC 22 basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically fails its save is [[Blinded]] for 1d4 rounds. After using this ability, the eunemvro becomes fatigued.</span>

###  Ambiguous Agenda

Like [[Jyoti]], eunemvros are inclined toward neither good nor evil. Indeed, they regard this binary conception of morality as imperceptible and pointless. To eunemvros, there's no right, only wrong—and that wrong is the scourge of undeath.
