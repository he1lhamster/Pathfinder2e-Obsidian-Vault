<span class="in-box-ability">**Otherworldly Mind** (mental) Whenever a creature targets the ravager of Tindalos with a mental effect, that creature takes 9d6 mental damage (DC 40 basic Will save). On a critical failure, it also becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ripping Gaze** (aura, evocation, occult, visual) 60 feet. The hound of Tindalos's eyes glow balefully, causing painful but bloodless wounds to rip open in the body of a creature that meets its awful gaze. When a creature ends its turn in the aura's emanation, it takes 9d6 slashing damage (DC 37 basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vulnerable to Curved Space** When a hound of Tindalos is not adjacent to a structural angle of 90º (or more acute), its resistance to physical damage is suppressed and it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. It can't recover from this sickened condition, but the condition ends automatically once the hound is again adjacent to a suitable angle.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Angled Entry** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The hound of Tindalos casts a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Dimension Door|dimension door]] spell, but it must transport itself into a space adjacent to an angle of 90º (or more acute) in the structure or environment around it. For example, it could teleport to a space adjacent to a wall (using the angle between the wall and floor) or a corner in a room, or adjacent to a sizable tree growing straight up out of the ground, but not to a flat plain or a room with only curved corners and edges.
 Once per day, the hound can use this ability to plane shift to or from the [[DATABASE/plane/Dimension of Time|Dimension of Time]], with the same restrictions on what angles it can appear next to.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ferocious Bites** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The ravager of Tindalos makes three Strikes with its jaws attack. Each Strike must be against a different opponent within its reach. Each attack counts toward the ravager's multiple attack penalty, but does not increase its penalty until it has made all the attacks.</span>
