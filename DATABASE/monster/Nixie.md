###  Bog Nixies

Nixies who dwell in swampy regions tend to have fouler attitudes and are more eager to turn to violence. Known as bog nixies, these evil fey prefer dwelling in festering swamps or blighted fens and delight in using their ability to grant desires to tempt visitors into acts of unplanned evil.
