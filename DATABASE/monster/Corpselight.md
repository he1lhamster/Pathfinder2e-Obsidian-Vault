# Corpselight

A [[Will-o’-Wisp]] that starves to death might rise as a cold, blue, glowing sphere of spongy wetness—a corpselight. A corpselight instinctively seeks out a host corpse to dwell within, as its physical form quickly deteriorates if not hidden within a dead creature.

A corpselight that starts its turn in wisp form must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of its turn; if it fails, it loses 1 Hit Point. A corpselight reduced to 0 Hit Points while in wisp form is destroyed.</span>

All living creatures in this area must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw. If at least 1 creature fails its save, the corpselight regains 2d6 Hit Points, gaining any that exceed its maximum as temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute. The corpselight can't use Death Light again for 1d4 rounds.

###  Larger Corpselights

A typical corpselight can animate only a Small or Medium corpse, but particularly powerful corpselights can inhabit larger bodies. Their basic abilities remain the same, but the damage they deal and the DC of their Death Light increase as appropriate for their increased level.
