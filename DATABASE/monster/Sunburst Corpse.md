# Sunburst Corpse

Warlords and heroes alike often fell their enemies and leave the corpses behind, exposed to the elements. Undead tend to rise in the dark of night and shun the cleansing rays of the sun, but this isn't the rule for all undead. The corpse of a particularly evil individual left exposed to the constant beating of the sun might become a sunburst corpse. These undead radiate light and wield sunlight as a weapon. Sunburst corpses initially seek revenge for their deaths but thereafter wander with undirected rage.

**Light Camouflage** The sunburst corpse is [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] in areas of natural bright light, such as due to sunlight or [[DATABASE/equipment/Torch|torches]], even to creatures that can see clearly in bright light. Magical bright light and light from the sunburst corpse's blinding aura don't conceal the sunburst corpse.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Blinding Aura** (aura, evocation, incapacitation, light, occult, visual) 60 feet. The sunburst corpse sheds bright light. Any creature that starts its turn in the emanation must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save. If it fails, it's [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 minute, and if it critically fails, it's blinded permanently. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Darkness Vulnerability** A sunburst corpse is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] while in areas of magical darkness. If the level of the magical darkness effect is at least half of the sunburst corpse's level (a 7th-level effect against most sunburst corpses), the sunburst corpse is also [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] while in the area.</span>

It deals 12d8 fire damage to all creatures in a 20-foot emanation (DC 34 basic Fortitude save). A creature that fails its save becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the end of its next turn. The sunburst corpse can't use Nova Burst again for 1d4 rounds, and its blinding aura becomes inactive during this time.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Residual Light** (evocation, light, occult) When a sunburst corpse Strikes or Grapples a creature, some of the corpse's light clings to the creature for a moment. The creature must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the end of its next turn. On a critical failure, the creature is dazzled for 1 minute. A dazzled creature can use an Interact action to wick off the light and remove the dazzled condition.</span>
