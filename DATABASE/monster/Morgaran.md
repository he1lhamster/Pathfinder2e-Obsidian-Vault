<span class="in-box-ability">**Crystal Implant** (divine, enchantment, mental) The wolf-head shaped crystal implanted in Mogaran's brow pulses with shadowy energy at the start of each of his turns. Any PC who's legendary in [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] and sees this can attempt a DC 36 check using one of those skills; on a success, they realize the crystal is manipulating Mogaran's actions in some way. If the crystal is destroyed or deactivated, Mogaran regains control of his actions (with repercussions as detailed on page 68). The crystal functions as a 19th-level magic item for the purposes of [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]], but it can also be destroyed by specifically targeting it (AC 40; Hardness 20; HP 90). Alternately, a character can pry the crystal from Mogaran's brow with a successful DC 36 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check, which takes an Interact action, but only if Mogaran is [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Frightful Presence|Frightful Presence]]** (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 35. This aura is suppressed as long as Mogaran's crystal implant is functioning.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Restoration Vulnerability** Mogaran is repulsed by the restoration of souls. He takes 3d10+10 mental damage the first time each round a creature within 100 feet of him is restored to life or loses the [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]] condition.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Smoking Wound** A creature damaged by Mogaran's jaws is sickened 1 from the rank smell of vapors from the wound.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Soulfire Breath** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (death, divine, necromancy, negative) Mogaran exhales ghostly green fire in a 60-foot cone. Living creatures in the area take 18d6 negative damage (DC 38 basic Reflex save). A good creature that fails this save becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]] for 1 minute (stupefied 4 on a critical failure). A creature slain by Soulfire Breath can't be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] spell. Mogaran can't use Soulfire Breath again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Soulfire Inhalation** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, healing, necromancy) **Requirements** Mogaran's last action was Soulfire Breath; **Effect** Mogaran inhales and regains 10 Hit Points for each creature damaged by his Soulfire Breath. Any excess healing is gained as temporary Hit Points, which remain for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Stunning Tail** (incapacitation) If Mogaran critically hits with his tail Strike, the target must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round (1d4 rounds on a critical failure).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Trample|Trample]]** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Large or smaller, claw, DC 38</span>
