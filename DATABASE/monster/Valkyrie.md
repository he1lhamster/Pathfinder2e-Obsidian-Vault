# Valkyrie

Choosers of the slain and so-called angels of battle, the song of the valkyries plays wherever steel rings against steel. Valkyries are humanoid individuals of impressive physical stature who seek the most epic battles and legendary conflicts so that they can lay claim to the souls of the world's greatest warriors. The valkyries transform these souls into the implacable immortals known as [[DATABASE/monster/Einherji|einherjar]].
 Valkyries most often serve gods of battle and war, though a valkyrie might pledge their service to any deity they consider worthy. [[DATABASE/deity/Gorum|Gorum]] is particularly well known for having valkyrie and einherjar servants, though he isn't the only such deity. [[DATABASE/deity/Besmara|Besmara]] also has valkyrie servitors, and many stories of “ghost ships” actually reference accounts of encounters with ships manned by einherjar crews devoted to the Pirate Queen.

**Claimer of the Slain** (divine, necromancy) Valkyries can detect the souls of those recently slain in combat. A valkyrie spends 10 minutes praying over the body of a creature who has been dead for no more than 12 hours; if that creature is worthy of becoming an [[DATABASE/monster/Einherji|einherji]] and of the appropriate alignment, the valkyrie transforms that creature into an einherji.
**Ravenspeaker** (divination, divine) Valkyries use ravens as servants and spies. They can speak with ravens, and they can have up to three raven servitors who follow their commands. Valkyries can constantly observe whatever their commanded ravens sense.

###  Boneyard Advocates

While praying to claim a slain warrior, a valkyrie fractures their own consciousness into two parts: mind and soul. They send their mind spinning along the River of Souls to collect and advocate on behalf of the slain warrior's soul. When the prayer ends, the valkyrie reunites their mind and body, and they join the warrior's body and soul into a single form as a new einherji.
