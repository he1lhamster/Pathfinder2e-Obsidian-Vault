# Stone Spider

The tradition of venerating spiders as wards against vermin, pests, and evil in general far predates the modern [[DATABASE/monster/Jorogumo|jorogumo]] rule, with stone spiders filling a role similar to [[DATABASE/monster/Stone Lion|stone lions]]. Stone spider guardian beasts can be found perched on plinths near town and village entrances, standing motionless—for generations in some cases—so that many locals have forgotten their local guardian is anything more than a decoration.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bonded Vessel** The condition of a stone spider's vessel dictates its maximum HP. Undamaged, the vessel is an object with 62 HP (BT 31). When the stone spider is in spirit form, damaging it doesn't hurt the vessel, but damaging the vessel deals an equal amount of damage to the stone spider. When the stone spider Inhabits its Vessel, they're a single target, and damage reduces the HP of both the stone spider and the vessel. If the vessel is [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], the stone spider can still fight while inhabiting it and suffers no ill effect, but if the vessel is ever destroyed, the stone spider is instantly slain and can't reconstitute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Reconstitution** (divine, necromancy) sww When the stone spider reaches 0 Hit Points, its spirit dissipates. If its bonded vessel is intact, the stone spider re-forms in this vessel after 2d4 days, fully healed. If the vessel is [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], it must first be [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repaired]], after which the stone spider re-forms in 3d4 days.</span>

###  Mindscape Perks

When Ugly Cute, the stone spider who protects Willowshore, is slain in the modern era and their bonded vessel is destroyed, they don't dissipate. Instead, they awaken in Willowshore's mindscape, fully merged with their vessel. While in the mindscape, Ugly Cute can move their stone body as if it were a living body. They function at all times as if Inhabiting their Vessel and they are unable to cease Inhabiting their Vessel. If Ugly Cute is destroyed in the mindscape, they remain destroyed and can't reconstitute, although if the mindscape were to reset, Ugly Cute would return to life as well, once more fully Inhabiting their Vessel.
