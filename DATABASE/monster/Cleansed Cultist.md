The hourglass-shaped scar on their forehead bulges briefly before a bloody worm is expelled from the center of the scar. This worm shoots through the air to target a single creature within 30 feet, who must then attempt a DC 24 Fortitude save. The cultist can't Release the Inmost Worm again for 1d4 rounds.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
 **Success** The worm lands on the target and causes agonizing pain before dropping to the floor and fading away. The target takes 3d6 mental damage.
 **Failure** The worm lands on the target and burrows into their flesh, leaving no trace of a hole. The target seems to age rapidly for a moment, takes 6d6 mental damage, and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] 1 for 1 round before the pain fades and the target returns to its actual age.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target also takes 6d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent mental damage]]. The target remains stupefied 1 as long as the mental damage persists, during which they appear to be aging rapidly. Once the persistent damage ends, the target's appearance reverts to normal.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]** The cleansed cultist deals an extra 2d6 precision damage to [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] creatures.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Twin Feint** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The cultist makes two Strikes, one with their shortsword and one with their dagger, both against the same target. The target is automatically [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against the second attack. Apply the cultist's multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally.</span>
