###  Tail Tales

A Kellid legend holds that the khravgodon once had a beautiful tail covered with bright, thick fur. One night, the khravgodon fell asleep in the open, having danced all night showing off its beautiful tail. When it awoke, [[DATABASE/monster/Ankhrav|ankhravs]] had chewed all the hair off khravgodon's tail, leaving it with the bald appendage we see today. Khravgodons have been taking revenge on ankhravs ever since.
