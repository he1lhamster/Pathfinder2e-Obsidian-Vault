# Veiled Master (Vidileth)

The powerful vidileths are the insidious veiled masters of the alghollthus. These manipulators of mind and body alike lead their species in the open, using their ability to change form to walk among and deceive humans and other sapient species. Many veiled masters are even more powerful than the typical specimen presented here and can use a wide range of arcane or occult spells and rituals. While veiled masters command significant combat prowess and impressive magical skills, the greatest danger they pose to others is their uncanny ability to infiltrate into societies much different than their own. The most paranoid of adventurers and conspiracy scholars worry that every major city has been infested by secret cabals of vidileths, while others dismiss this as hogwash and fearmongering. The truth is likely somewhere in between, but it doesn’t take many veiled masters pulling the strings behind the scenes to wreak havoc upon an entire nation!

###  Ancient Influences

The veiled masters influenced the ancient Azlanti, and it was they who invoked the apocalypse of Earthfall to destroy Azlant when humanity grew too prideful. That this act also called down the magical _Starstone_, an artifact capable of transforming mortals into gods, was an ironic turn of events considering the alghollthus’ intolerance for faith.
