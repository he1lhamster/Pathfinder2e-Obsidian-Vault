# Forge-Spurned

Evil [[Dwarf]] who die having failed to live up to the exacting standards of the [[Duergar]] god [[Droskar]] are sometimes forced to return to the material world as undead abominations known as forge-spurned. Forge-spurned look like dwarves with pupilless eyes and leathery flesh, and with their hair and beard made of smoke and fire—newly formed forge-spurned can almost be mistaken for living creatures as a result. The longer forge-spurned exist, the more skeletal and fiery their visage becomes; those who have existed for centuries or more often look as if they have skulls for faces and fire for hair.

This can affect either a 30-foot cone or a 20-foot burst centered on the forge-spurned and persists for 1d4 rounds. Each creature that moves into or starts their turn in the area takes 6d6 fire damage, with a DC 21 basic Reflex save. A creature who fails its save is also [[Blinded]] for 1 minute. Creatures within the cloud are [[Concealed]], though not from the forge-spurned.

An individual whose soul is bound in this way can't be resurrected unless the _soul chain_ is destroyed (Hardness 5, HP 20, BT 10).</span>

###  Haunted Forges

Forge-spurned are often encountered near abandoned forges, and the presence of these undead dwarves can infest that forge with an ever-burning fire. Such “haunted” forges burn without the need for fuel, though they extinguish automatically when their forge-spurned source is destroyed.

###  Soul Chains

A forge-spurned wields a soul chain: a cursed _+1 [[Striking]] [[Flaming]] [[Spiked Chain]]_. Any other creature that has a _soul chain_ must succeed at a DC 22 Will save each day at sundown or transform into a forge-spurned permanently. A forge-spurned stops at nothing to retrieve its _soul chain_ if it’s lost.
