# Simurgh

Desert-dwelling people consider the sight of a simurgh a herald to a lifetime’s worth of luck, and those who are unfamiliar with the majestic beast might mistake it for the avatar of a deity. Beautiful, graceful, and truly gargantuan, the simurgh resembles nothing so much as a massive multicolored bird with the head of an equally enormous and regal lupine. Simurghs act as intermediaries in world-threatening conflicts, serving as agents of good deities or vigilantes who spread their own brand of justice, typically by obliterating or banishing evil extraplanar beings.
 Simurghs can live for thousands of years, and because these ancient beings are so rare many doubt their existence. But they are very real, as those who have been aided by a simurgh can enthusiastically attest. A simurgh does not show itself often, but when it does, it is typically in response to a truly grave threat, such as the incursion of an undead army or the rampage of some truly epic monster. Simurghs are nothing if not paragons of righteousness, and goodly heroes can hardly find a better ally in their quest to vanquish evil than a simurgh.

###  Simurgh

While simurghs can be found in the service of most good-aligned faiths, it is the teachings of Shelyn, goddess of art, to which these creatures are most often drawn. A temple of Shelyn that has managed to attract the attention and friendship of a simurgh typically honors the creature’s privacy and does not boast of the alliance, yet won’t hesitate to call for its aid in times of need.
