description: "Succubi are manifestations of the sin of destructive lust, and they\
  \ are the most attractive of all demons\u2014as befits their role in seducing mortals\
  \ to fall to sin. The concept of gender is fluid to a succubus, as they can adopt\
  \ countless humanoid forms of any gender to aid in their goals. Most succubi have\
  \ a feminine true form (incubi, which usually have a masculine true form, are a\
  \ different kind of demon), but regardless of gender, a lust demon is supernaturally\
  \ beautiful or handsome, but with curving horns, bat wings, sharp claws, and a sinuous\
  \ tail.<br/><br/> When disguised as a mortal humanoid on the Material Plane, a succubus\
  \ whispers into the ears of mortals, urging them to pursue their darkest and most\
  \ destructive desires and pushing them into depravity, using magic only if persuasion\
  \ fails. While mortals often fixate on succubi\u2019s application of sexual lust,\
  \ these demons are can easily exploit lust for power, knowledge, fame, or any other\
  \ desire as easily as more carnal appetites. Their ability to infiltrate societies\
  \ makes them excellent spies, assassins, and political saboteurs as well. Ultimately,\
  \ the succubus enjoys all means of upending mortal culture.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\
