# Wihsaak

These gaunt and insectile sahkils torment their foes by focusing on a widespread fear of insects and creeping, crawling vermin. Unlike their more subtle cousins, wihsaaks don't lurk in the periphery and instead directly engage their targets, using their unnerving buzzing to disorient and terrify. When encountering multiple foes, wihsaaks attempt to spread fear to everyone before slashing at them with their devastating claws.

**Easy to Call** A sahkil's level is considered 2 lower for the purpose of being conjured by the [[Planar Binding]] ritual (and potentially other rituals, at the GM's discretion), but it is always free to attack or leave instead of negotiate unless the primary caster's check is a critical success.
