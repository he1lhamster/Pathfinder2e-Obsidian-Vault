description: "Narwhals are mid-sized whales known for the long tusk that grows from\
  \ their nose. The tusk, forming from a protruding canine tooth, appears primarily\
  \ on males and can grow up to 10 feet in length over the course of an adult narwhal's\
  \ life. In addition to helping the narwhal attract mates (much like a peacock's\
  \ feathers), the tusk can serve as a weapon.<br/><br/> Like dolphins, narwhals communicate\
  \ via clicks and whistles, and they use sound to navigate and hunt. They congregate\
  \ in groups of five to 10, except in the summer when they gather in the hundreds.\
  \ Adult narwhals are typically 13\u201318 feet long (not counting the tusk) and\
  \ weigh 1,500\u20133,500 pounds.<br/><br/> The similarities between a narwhal's\
  \ tusk and a unicorn's horn have led to the narwhals' nickname of \u201Csea unicorns,\u201D\
  \ but the narwhal's tusk is not made of the same highly sought material. Legends\
  \ surrounding narwhals have nevertheless attributed magical characteristics to these\
  \ remarkable tusks, such as neutralizing poison. Collectors and artisans also value\
  \ the tusks as an elegant crafting material useful for carvings and other works\
  \ of art.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Animal</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]]\

# Nasurgeth (Nightwave)

Nasurgeths are hungry voids with glowing eyestalks and thousands of teeth. They lurk deep beneath the waves where the sunlight doesn't reach. At night, they ascend to the skies and rain destruction and ruin down on all the living.
