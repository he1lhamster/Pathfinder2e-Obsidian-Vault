# Chromatic Ooze

Chromatic oozes result from the worst kind of alchemical mishaps: attempts to combine as many types of elemental damage as possible into a single alchemical substance. Although the source of these alchemical concatenations are as varied as the alchemists who attempt to distill them, one of the most common methods for creating them involves combining the essences of multiple types of chromatic dragons together using eldritch alchemical processes. When this type of experimentation goes dangerously wrong—as it often does—the result is a combination of terrible elemental power with the mindless destructive power of an ooze. A chromatic ooze is a rippling, seething substance that shifts through several different colors, but chemical reactions within the ooze can lock its energy and its color into a specific phase for a short time. Whether a chromatic ooze's destructive urges derive from the frustrated ingenuity of an alchemist creator or from the hunger of the chromatic dragons that so often constitute these oozes' forms, the best way to deal with a chromatic ooze is to stay out of its way.

A creature that enters the aura or starts its turn within it is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] unless it succeeds at a DC 37 Fortitude save. Creatures with the scent ability or a particularly heightened sense of smell are sickened 2, or sickened 1 on a successful Fortitude save.

If it already had resistance to another damage type from this ability, it loses the resistance to that damage type and gains weakness 20 to it. If it already had weakness to another damage type from this ability, it loses that weakness. After 1 minute, the chromatic ooze returns to its usual rippling, multicolored hue and loses the resistance and weakness from this ability.</span>

###  Dangers of Hubris

Spend enough time among alchemists and you'll likely hear tales of bombs capable of producing multiple elemental effects at the same time. The process for making these bombs requires specialized ingredients and the utmost skill. Few alchemists manage to combine two damage types, much less five. These the latter efforts, when mishandled, create chromatic oozes.
