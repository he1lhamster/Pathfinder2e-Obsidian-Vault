# Jorogumo

Appearing as beautiful, well-dressed humans, jorogumo lurk in the high mountains and prey on travelers. These evil creatures can fully change into a giant spider or sprout spider legs from their backs, and they often keep giant spiders as pets. Jorogumo usually eat their prey, but some humanoids meet an even more gruesome fate as living incubators for jorogumo eggs. Though most jorogumos are solitary creatures, some have taken up worship of [[DATABASE/deity/Norgorber|Norgorber]] and serve as valuable allies to thieves' guilds following that god's guise as the Gray Master.

###  Jorogumo Animosity

Rather than attempting to manipulate a [[DATABASE/ancestry/Tengu|tengu]] traveler, jorogumos usually fly into a rage and attempt to murder them as quickly as possible. The source of this single-minded hatred isn't clear, but some jorogumos insist, without any factual support, that tengus can see through their trickery with a mere glance and are immune to their venom.
