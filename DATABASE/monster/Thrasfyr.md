# Thrasfyr

As bizarre in appearance as they are ferocious, thrasfyrs resemble six-limbed bears with bull-like horns, draconic scales, and a fire-breathing serpent for a tail. Every thrasfyr is wrapped in animated chains psychically linked to the creature's mind.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The thrasfyr's serpent tail breathes a blast of flame in a 50-foot cone, dealing 10d12 fire damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save). It can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rider's Bond** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divination, mental, primal) The thrasfyr designates one creature as its rider by touching the rider with its claw. The thrasfyr and rider can communicate with each other telepathically at any range on the same plane and are aware of each other's present state, direction from each other, distance from each other, and any conditions affecting either.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tangling Chains** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (incapacitation, primal, transmutation) The thrasfyr thrashes its chains in all directions. Each creature in a 15-foot emanation takes 18d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 38 basic Reflex save); creatures that fail are [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] until the start of the thrasfyr's next turn. The thrasfyr can't use Tangling Chains or make chain Strikes for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Whirling Frenzy** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The thrasfyr makes a jaws Strike, a horn Strike, and two claw Strikes, each against a different target. Each attack counts toward the thrasfyr's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks.</span>
