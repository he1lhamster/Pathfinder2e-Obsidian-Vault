# Kithangian (Beast Demon)

The kithangian—a horrifying amalgam of [[Horse]] and [[Scorpion]] also known as a “beast demon”—is a foul fiend born of the souls of mortals who abused and tormented animals in life. Kithangians tend to roam wild areas rife with animals to torture, though humanoid settlements with plenty of pets or livestock also make for tantalizing hunting grounds. Uncontested for too long, a kithangian's presence has a corrupting influence on the local fauna, which birth fiendish monstrosities until the demon is vanquished. If it realizes it's being tracked by vengeful [[Druid]] or demon slayers, a kithangian assumes the shape of an unassuming animal so it can get the jump on its pursuers.
