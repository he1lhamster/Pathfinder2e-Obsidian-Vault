# Oppali

An oppali is a tenacious, twisting vine with white, trumpet-shaped flowers that grows in temperate and tropical regions. Stories passed down through generations refer to the oppali as a “bad luck vine” and warn against letting one take over a copse or garden, lest “your luck drain away like water down a hole.” This folklore contains more wisdom than most farmers or settlers realize.
 Oppalis are usually 30 feet long, but they twist and coil on themselves so much that they occupy a space not much larger than a horse.

###  Oppali Trumpets

An oppali's tough trumpets are useful for creating [[DATABASE/equipment/Thunderstone|thunderstones]]. Incorporating crushed oppali trumpet into crafting the thunderstone grants a +2 item bonus to the [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check, provided that this material makes up at least half of the raw materials used for the thunderstone. With a successful DC 27 [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] check, a character harvests 5d20 gp of this raw material from a defeated oppali (double on a critical success, half on a failure, and none at all from a critical failure).
