# Tallow Ooze

Pale yellow and smelling of meat, this unnatural, globular monster is composed entirely of rendered animal fat. A tallow ooze typically results from magical mishaps during the creation of enchanted candles or soaps, or while rendering the fat of a magical beast, though occasionally spellcasters create these beings intentionally.
 A tallow ooze hunts other creatures to subsume them into its own body and absorb their fat. Since tallow is solid at room temperature, tallow oozes must metabolize their own bodies to produce enough heat to remain gelatinous. A tallow ooze that cannot replenish itself with absorbed fat will either consume itself or solidify, though a tallow ooze exposed to too much heat might melt entirely.

For 1d4 rounds, the affected creature must attempt a DC 30 Reflex save whenever it uses any item (including weapons) that must be wielded or held. On a failure, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to any attack roll or check to use the item; on a critical failure, the creature drops the item, which lands in a random adjacent square. The creature (or an adjacent ally) can use 1 Interact action to wipe off the grease from an item or from its hands.</span>

###  Saponaceous Tallow Ooze

Exposure to a sufficient quantity of alkali (such as from ash) may cause a chemical reaction in a tallow ooze, turning it into a mass of living soap. Such saponaceous tallow oozes leave residual glycerol in their wake instead of grease (though the effects are the same) and gain the following ability. 
**Soapy Effluence** When a saponaceous tallow ooze is exposed to at least a gallon of water, takes damage from an ability with the water trait, or fails a saving throw against an effect with the water trait, it releases a cloud of bubbles that fills a 10-foot burst around the ooze’s current space for 1 minute. Creatures within the area are [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]].
