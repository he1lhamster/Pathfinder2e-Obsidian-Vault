# Suvarden

While the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Dimension of Time]] remain distinct realities, the two share a powerful connection. Suvardens are living embodiments of this connection.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Web of Fate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divination, primal) The suvarden creates a web spun from the threads of fate in a 10-foot burst within 30 feet. The squares filled with the web are difficult terrain. Each square can be cleared of the web by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. Each time a creature in the web begins to use a move action or enters the web during a move action, it must attempt a DC 25 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and doesn't need to attempt further saving throws against the web.
 **Success** The creature is momentarily baffled by glimpses of possible futures and is [[Flat-Footed]] for 1 round.
 **Failure** Possibilities spun throughout the web overwhelm the creature. It becomes [[Confused]] for 1 round.
 **Critical Failure** As critical failure, but the duration is 1 minute and the creature is [[Sickened]] while it's confused.</span>

###  A Matter of Time

Suvardens have a connection to the [[Dimension of Time]], but exist more as natives of the [[Material Plane]]. As a result, they do not possess the Time trait. Suvardens refuse to elaborate on their place within existence and time. A suvarden first tries to maintain the order of cause and effect with its guidance, but when that fails, more powerful or cruel creatures increasingly get involved. Most agree that meeting a suvarden is preferable to encountering a [[Hound of Tindalos]] or [[Siktempora]], although there certainly exist powerful suvardens as well.
