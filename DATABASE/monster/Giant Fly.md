# Giant Fly

This pony-sized fly's twitching limbs seem to never stop moving as it constantly cleans itself and scoops anything edible into its mouthparts. While primarily carrion eaters, giant flies sometimes prey on livestock or other animals too slow to get away.

###  Fly Species

The giant fly presented here is but the most common of these unsettlingly oversized pests. Others can grow much larger, such as the blood-drinking glutton fly, the highly toxic and foul-smelling blight fly, and the immensely bloated plague fly—a nauseating creature ironically incapable of flight that fattens itself on undead flesh and carries a host of awful diseases.
