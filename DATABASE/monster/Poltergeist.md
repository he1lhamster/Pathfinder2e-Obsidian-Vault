# Poltergeist

When a creature dies, and for whatever reason its spirit is unable or unwilling to leave the site of its death, that spirit may manifest as a poltergeist: a restless invisible spirit that is still able to manipulate physical objects. Many poltergeists perished in a way that resulted from or has led to extreme emotional trauma.

Each creature within 30 feet must attempt a DC 21 Will save, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 2]] on a failure. On a critical failure, it’s also fleeing for as long as it’s [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]]. On a success, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* When this effect is spread out among multiple foes, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike at a –2 penalty against each creature within 30 feet. These count as one attack for the poltergeist’s multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
* When this effect has only one target, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike against the target, and the damage increases to 3d12. It deals 1d12 damage on a failure, and no damage on a critical failure.

###  Disturbed Rest

One of the most common ways for a poltergeist to form is when its burial site is desecrated by the construction of a dwelling. This is usually an accident, but some evil creatures seek out such burial sites, intentionally creating poltergeists to serve as guardians.

###  Poltergeist Treasure

A poltergeist needs items to hurl as weapons, and over the centuries of use, only durable objects survive its rampages. Silver dinnerware, hatchets, and books might all be found in a poltergeist’s collection.
