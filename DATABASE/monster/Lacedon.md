# Lacedon

Feared by mariners and coastal dwellers everywhere, the aquatic ghouls known as lacedons are said to be the spawn of an ancient crew of sailors who became lost at sea and were forced to resort to cannibalism to survive. Their appearance is the stuff of a diver's nightmare, supplementing the vicious traits of their land-bound kin with spines, fins, and wide mouths bristling with needle-sharp teeth like piscine predators of the nethermost ocean depths.

###  Lacedon Schools

Lacedons travel in packs that can number as many as several dozen, typically led by the largest and oldest member, endlessly roaming the oceans with the sole objective of satisfying their boundless appetites for humanoid flesh. They have been known to emerge from the sea in ravenous swarms to devour entire populations of seaside fishing villages
