# Ssumzili

Ssumzilis are lanky, murderous fey who delight in the thrill of the hunt. They are particularly skilled/adept at stalking their prey in the rain and most commonly reside in rainforests and coastal regions, where frequent rain provides ample opportunity to hunt. Camouflaged by their cloud-gray skin, ssumzilis often compete in tests of stealth when hunting in groups, taking particular delight in approaching their quarry as closely as possible without being observed.

###  Hunting Patterns of Ssumzilis

Being ambush hunters, ssumzilis tend to avoid hunting without the cover of rainfall whenever possible. A ssumzili encountered hunting on a sunny day is doing so out of desperation and is likely to be unpredictable and erratic as a result.
