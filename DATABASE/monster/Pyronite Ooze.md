# Ooze, Pyronite

With the discovery of the incredible gelatinous explosive called pyronite, it was perhaps inevitable alchemical monstrosities made of the stuff would soon follow. So-called pyronite oozes sometimes spontaneously manifest from stockpiles of pyronite or other powerful explosives, typically amid mana storms or when affected by powerful magic.
 Pyronite oozes have an extremely unstable life cycle and are defined by their ability to continuously explode and reform themselves. A pyronite ooze's violent explosions hinder observations, making it difficult to learn anything from the volatile jelly. To complicate matters further, pyronite oozes seem drawn to other unstable alchemical concoctions. Test subjects brought to the Spellscar Desert have been observed bathing themselves in pools of magic-polluted effluvia. Although they typically reform into a single entity after exploding, pyronite oozes bathed in chemicals sometimes remain apart after splitting, creating two independent oozes. Some speculate that an as yet unknown reagent must be essential for the oozes to reproduce on their own.

###  Unstable Hibernation

After crawling on the ceiling or into some other darkened corner, pyronite oozes sometimes go into a dormant state for days or months. While in this torpor, they become even more dangerous as unstable chemicals seep from the ooze and form into crystals on its surface. These crystals are highly explosive. The ooze's hibernation ends when a slight movement or small spark ignites the crystals, triggering its Exploding Split ability and dealing twice the usual amount of damage.
