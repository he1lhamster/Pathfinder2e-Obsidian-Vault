# Balor (Fire Demon)

When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most envision is the balor—a towering figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with a flaming whip and a sword flying through the night in search of its latest victim. On the Abyss, balors serve demon lords as generals or captains, and they typically command vast legions of demons. Standing at 14 feet in height, only the cruelest mortal souls—those who devoted entire lives to sins too numerous to count—can fuel the formation of a balor. More often, a balor forms from a mass of dozens of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life.

### Balor Lords

Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most likely to eventually transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming a nascent demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the role of a true demon lord.

All creatures and objects in range take 16d10 fire damage (DC 45 basic Reflex save). Because the flame is infused with Abyssal energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual fire resistance. Creatures with immunity to fire use an outcome one degree of success better than what they rolled, instead of gaining the usual benefit of immunity. The bodies of creatures reduced to 0 Hit Points by a balor’s death throes are completely incinerated into fine ash.</span>
