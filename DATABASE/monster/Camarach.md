# Camarach

Planar travel is at best imprecise, yet still too predictable for the erratic nature of the [[DATABASE/plane/Maelstrom|Maelstrom]]. Camaraches are spontaneous manifestations of the Maelstrom resisting the imposed order required to erect planar gates. Camaraches rarely leave the Maelstrom, but the internal skin of their rocky bodies constantly splits into temporary extraplanar portals and collapses again. The planar travel a camarach produces is wholly random, and even the camarach has no inkling where it sends victims.

###  A Serendipitous Journey

A camarach has no control over where it shunts creatures; such precise control is antithetical to its nature. Yet these living portals can, if they choose, send creatures to where the creatures are most needed, or to the place that best advances their immediate goals (although the camarach never knows where that is). Camaraches don't generally do so, of course, but might if made friendly to heroes in need of planar travel.
