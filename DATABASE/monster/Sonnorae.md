<span class="in-box-ability">**Assemble Choir** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Sonnorae adds a creature that is affected by her Spirit-Flensing Touch and is within 100 feet to her choir of screams. Sonnorae can have any number of creatures in her choir, although a creature no longer affected by Spirit-Flensing Touch leaves the choir immediately. Creatures in Sonnorae's choir of screams are [[Fascinated]] by each other and Sonnorae, and they can't use hostile actions toward each other or Sonnorae. If Sonnorae uses a hostile action toward a creature in her choir, it immediately leaves the choir. When Sonnorae casts an innate divine spell, she can cause the effect to originate from any member of her choir instead of herself, using her saving throw DC and attack bonus.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Focus Gaze** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, enchantment, mental, visual) Sonnorae stares at a creature she can see within 30 feet. The target must attempt a Will save against Sonnorae's unnerving gaze. In addition, if the creature was already [[Doomed]], on a failed save, it sees the skin of its body peel back, making it [[Confused]] for as long as it remains doomed. After attempting this save, the creature is then temporarily immune until the start of Sonnorae's next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spirit-Flensing Touch** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, mental, necromancy) Sonnorae touches a creature within 10 feet. The target's spirit tears through its organs and flesh and must attempt a DC 40 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected, and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
 **Success** The creature takes 4d6 slashing damage.
 **Failure** The creature takes 9d6 damage and is [[Sickened]] and [[Stupefied]]. As long as the creature remains sickened, it must use one action on its turn to scream in agony.
 **Critical Failure** The creature takes 18d6 damage and is sickened 2 and stupefied 2. As long as the creature remains sickened, it must use two actions on its turn to scream in agony.</span>
