# Weykoward

Beneath the camps of Hillcross, Mammoth Lord followings store belongings both precious and mundane in unsecured vaults called weykos. As power changes hands among Mammoth Lords and followings go extinct or become forgotten, such weykos are often abandoned for so long that they become indistinguishable from trash heaps or middens. Furthermore, if the conditions are just so, such weykos can spring to life as a result of latent primal magic or ancestral memories locked within the forgotten weyko that refuse to be forgotten.

###  Spontaneous Guardians

Most weykowards across Golarion guard out of the way places whose people moved on long ago. These weykowards are primarily a danger to explorers or tomb robbers who intrude on the areas they defend. Weykowards that arise in societies where cultural practices of trash disposal remain unchanged for millennia, such as the Five Kings Mountains and the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, defend locals as fervently as they do their middens.
