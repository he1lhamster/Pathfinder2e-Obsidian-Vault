<span class="in-box-ability">**Burning Sacrifice** (divine, evocation, fire) When the sun warrior is destroyed, they explode in a blast of flame that deals 6d6 fire damage in a 10-foot emanation (DC 27 basic Reflex save). Creatures that critically fail their saves are marked with [[DATABASE/deity/Walkena|Walkena's]] religious symbol on a visible area of their body, which remains for 1 day. This mark allows Walkena to treat the creature as if he knew the creature's identity but not having met them for the purposes of [[DATABASE/spell/Scrying|scrying]], lowering the spell's DC by 2. The sun warrior's gear and treasure are unaffected by the explosion and left in a pile where they die.</span>
