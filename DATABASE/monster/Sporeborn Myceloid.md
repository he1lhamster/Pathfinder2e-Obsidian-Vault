# Sporeborn Myceloid

While most sporeborn are created from the flesh of vertebrates or creatures with exoskeletons, fungal and plant creatures serve as a fine host for a sporeborn's parasitic spores. In these cases, the sporeborn mycelial network burrows through the corpse, replacing the original hyphae in fungal creatures and the xylem and pith in plants. This allows the sporeborn to puppet the creature, much as it does in mammals by replacing the tendons with its own rugged mycelium. Fungus and plant hosts are more likely to develop the potent poison sporeborn ability to enhance the hosts' natural abilities.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Rancid Spore Pods** The sporeborn is covered in spore pods that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or a critical hit. In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with spores, causing them to become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] 1 unless they succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spore Pop** If a sporeborn myceloid is reduced to 0 HP by a critical hit, it pops, forcing it to immediately Emit Spores, even if it has already used the ability that day.</span>

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** Until the end of its next turn, the target is helpful to sporeborn myceloids and can’t take hostile actions against them.
**Failure** As success, but for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** As success, but until the purple pox is cured.</span>
