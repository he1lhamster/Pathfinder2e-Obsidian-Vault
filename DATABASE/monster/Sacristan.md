# Sacristan

Sacristans are failures among the velstracs, creatures whose bodies and minds have been utterly broken by the velstracs' torments. These unfortunates are assembled from scrap metal, nerveless flesh, and bits of darkness into loyal agents who take ecstatic pleasure in serving other velstracs. Sacristans are empowered by a miniature gateway to the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] deep in their mouths. By distending their jaws, they can howl with the shrieks and windstorms of that plane. Sacristans vary in appearance but are the size of maimed humans. Their features are redundant or absent and they are wrapped in barbed and rusted chains.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Focus Gaze** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) The sacristan stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately attempt a Will save against Staggering Servitude. In addition, if the creature was already [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned]], on a failed save its revulsion toward the sacristan's presence causes it to be [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]] for 1 minute. After attempting this save, the creature is then temporarily immune until the start of the sacristan's next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Shadow Scream** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (aura, concentrate, darkness, divine, evocation, mental, sonic) **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The sacristan opens their mouth to unloose the wailing howls and mind-twisting darkness of the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]]. This creates a 30-foot emanation of darkness and wailing sounds around the sacristan. Creatures with [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]] can't see through this darkness. The sacristan can Sustain Shadow Scream for up to 1 minute. Non-velstrac creatures in the area when the ability is used, as well as those who enter or start their turn in the area, must attempt a DC 28 Will save. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. 
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] for 1 round. 
**Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] and deafened for 1 round. 
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 20 mental damage, and is confused and deafened for 1 round.</span>
