# Spiritbound Aluum

Whereas most aluums are animated by the souls of volunteers loyal to Katapesh, the Pactmasters created a handful of more capable (and deadly) aluums powered by the souls of a dozen or more dangerous criminals. These spiritbound aluums are rarely used as peacekeepers, instead serving as assassins, elite bodyguards, or riot control during times of martial law.
 A spiritbound aluum has a dull blue crystalline focus that stores constituent souls, surrounded by a host of smaller gems used for trapping souls the Pactmasters wish to deny from entering the Great Beyond. Spiritbound aluums rarely use this soul-binding ability except when instructed by their masters. However, the murderous or embittered souls within the aluum sometimes exert control and willfully consume a departing soul either out of malice or to incorporate it into the construct’s core. If not relieved of its trapped souls in a timely manner, a spiritbound aluum can develop enough will to overcome its masters’ orders and even awaken to full sentience. These rogue aluums typically lose the mindless trait, are evil, have an Intelligence modifier of –2 or higher, and gain several skills with bonuses ranging from +25 to +32.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Aluum Antimagic** Spiritbound aluum are immune to spells and magical abilities, with two exceptions. A negative spell or magical ability grants a spiritbound aluum the [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] condition until the end of its next turn instead of its normal effects. A positive spell or ability makes a spiritbound aluum [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] until the end of its next turn instead of its normal effects.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Obliteration Beam** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (arcane, evocation, force) **Requirements** The spiritbound aluum has bound a soul using its [[DATABASE/spell/Bind Soul|bind soul]] innate spell; **Effect** The spiritbound aluum transforms the captured soul’s essence into raw magical energy, channeling the spirit into a beam that deals 20d6 force damage in a 30-foot line (DC 38 basic Reflex save). The remaining fragments of the captured soul are released to the Great Beyond. The spiritbound aluum can’t use Obliteration Beam again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Paralyzing Force** (arcane, incapacitation, necromancy) A creature damaged by the spiritbound aluum's fist Strike must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed for 1d4 minutes and falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Soul Binder** When a spiritbound aluum uses its [[DATABASE/spell/Bind Soul|bind soul]] innate spell, it binds the soul into its central crystal instead of the normal material component. The crystal can hold up to 60 souls. When encountered, a spiritbound aluum’s crystal typically contains 1d6 souls.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Soul Shriek** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (arcane, auditory, evocation, mental, sonic) The spiritbound aluum emits a keening wail in a 15-foot cone that deals 16d6 sonic damage (DC 27 basic Fortitude save). A creature that fails its save is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]], or stunned 3 on a critical failure. The aluum can’t use Soul Shriek again for 1d4 rounds.</span>
