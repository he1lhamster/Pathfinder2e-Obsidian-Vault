# Nikaramsa

Lies, knowledge, and deception are a nikaramsa's stock and trade. They are outstanding scholars, with deep and nuanced understanding of religion, philosophy, astrology, and similar subjects. They take particular delight in exploiting the greed and hubris of gullible worshippers, using them to desecrate and destroy their own faith. Even in their goal of undermining the holy, nikaramsas' twisted humor knows few bounds, and they prefer to take on the guise of divine messengers with boons to share. Once they find a likely victim or set of victims, they use their vast knowledge of religion to impart contradictory wisdom, leading to the eventual implosion of the faith from heresies of the clergy and congregation themselves.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Towering Stance** (divine, illusion) A nikaramsa is in fact a Medium creature, but appears as a Large creature due to the force of their personality. A creature interacting with the nikaramsa can attempt a DC 36 Will save to see the nikaramsa as they truly are. If the creature succeeds, the reach of nikaramsa's attacks against that foe decrease to 5 feet (10 feet for their tongue). If all creatures in the nikaramsa's vicinity successfully disbelieve this illusion, the nikaramsa becomes Medium and [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] for as long as everyone sees their true form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Pervert Miracle <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (curse, divine) **Trigger** A foe within 60 feet casts [[DATABASE/spell/Bless|bless]] or a beneficial spell that the nikaramsa could cast to remove an affliction or condition (such as [[DATABASE/spell/Neutralize Poison|neutralize poison]]); **Effect** The nikaramsa attempts to counteract the enemy's spell (counteract modifier +24 and counteract level 7). If the nikaramsa succeeds, the triggering creature is subjected to the effects of a [[DATABASE/spell/Bane|bane]] spell or the effect it was trying to remove.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Sap Mind** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, enchantment, mental) The nikaramsa focuses their gaze on one creature within 60 feet. That target must attempt a DC 34 Will save. Regardless of the outcome of the saving throw, the target then becomes temporarily immune for 1 day. 
**Critical Success** The nikaramsa is caught off guard by the strength of the target's resistance and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]] until the end of their next turn. 
**Success** The target resists the nikaramsa's influence. 
**Failure** The target's focus and willpower drain away; it becomes stupefied 2 for 1 minute. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes stupefied 3 for 1 hour.</span>

###  Cousins in Corruption

Many evil beings take interest in spreading heresies. While nikaramsas seek to unravel faiths from within, the devils known as [[DATABASE/monster/Deimavigga (Apostate Devil)|deimaviggas]] strive to lure individuals away from the gods, and [[DATABASE/monster/Shrine Skelm|shrine skelms]] leverage religions for their own benefit.
