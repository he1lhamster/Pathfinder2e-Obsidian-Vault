<span class="in-box-ability">**Dimensional Tether** A creature hit by a vazgorlu’s web Strike is [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] and stuck to the nearest surface until it Escapes (DC 42). As long as it remains immobilized by the web, the web attempts to counteract any effect that would move the webbed creature to another plane, with a counteract level of 10 and using the vazgorlu’s Arcana skill to attempt the counteract check.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Demiplane Lair** A vazgorlu maintains a 30-foot-diameter demiplane in the Astral Plane. Gravity in this demiplane pulls out from the center, so that creatures can walk upon the inner surface. A vazgorlu’s demiplane lair lacks a built-in point of exit, and if the vazgorlu fails to visit the demiplane during a 24-hour period, the demiplane collapses— all objects and creatures within are then returned to their original locations in the multiverse before they entered the demiplane. A vazgorlu can create a replacement demiplane lair with 24 hours of concentration.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Redirect Portal** A vazgorlu can spend 10 minutes in contact with a magical portal to redirect it, causing the portal to instead lead to its demiplane lair. To do so, the vazgorlu must succeed at a Portal Lore check (the DC is either equal to the caster’s spell DC for a portal created by a spell, or set by the portal’s level, as listed here; if the portal in question has no level listed, assume it’s a 20th-level portal).</span>

###  Vazgorlu Digestion

A vazgorlu gains nourishment from both the biological result of digesting a creature and the metaphysical consumption of that creature’s connection to the multiverse once it has been cut off from other dimensions. As such, a vazgorlu can only be truly sated while consuming prey in its own lair, where it can devour a creature in both ways.
