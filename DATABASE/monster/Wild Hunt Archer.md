# Wild Hunt Archer

These lithe, androgynous humanoids have pointed ears, glowing green eyes, and hair that flows softly at all times as if in a gentle breeze. They are methodical hunters who fire their bows with uncanny accuracy. Since wild hunt archers tend to be slower on foot than most of their companions, they often rely on [[DATABASE/monster/Wild Hunt Horse|wild hunt horses]] to provide increased mobility. Rather than carrying normal arrows, they can produce arrows as needed from magical quivers—these quivers do not function in this manner for anyone other than wild hunt archers.

**Wild Hunt Link** (aura, divination, magical) 500 feet. A wild hunt archer grants all other members of the wild hunt in the aura except wild hunt archer the ability to target [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] creatures with ranged Strikes without having to succeed at a DC 5 flat check.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Instinctive Cooperation** The wild hunt archer automatically achieves a critical success on saving throws against effects created by other allied wild hunt creatures.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wild Gaze** (aura, enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Those who meet the gaze of a wild hunt archer come face-to-face with the hunt's fearful power and find it difficult to act in the face of such a legendary legacy. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must succeed at a DC 34 Will save to resist becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] (slowed 2 on a critical failure). The wild hunt archer can deactivate or activate this aura by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Focus Gaze** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual) The wild hunt archer fixes its glare at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a Will save against the wild hunt archer's wild gaze. If the creature was already [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] by the wild gaze before attempting its save, a failed save causes it to be [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to Focus Gaze from any wild hunt until the start of the wild hunt archer's next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Infuse Arrow** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (magical) The wild hunt archer Casts a Spell with a range of touch and then makes a ranged Strike with their living bow. If they hit a creature with that Strike, that creature is also targeted by the spell's effects. If the Strike misses, the spell is wasted.
 Alternatively, the wild hunt archer can Cast a Spell that affects an area and then make a ranged Strike with their living bow. If they hit a creature with that Strike, the spell takes effect centered on that creature, and the creature struck takes a –2 circumstance penalty to any save against the spell's effect. If the Strike misses, the spell is wasted.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Living Bow** (primal, transmutation) The wild hunt archer carries a manifestation of their archery in the form of a living bow. This weapon functions as a _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost|frost]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Composite Longbow|composite longbow]]_ as long as it is wielded by the wild hunt archer, but in any other creature's hands the living bow functions as a normal, nonmagic composite longbow. A wild hunt archer can manifest a replacement living bow if its previous one is lost or destroyed by performing a one-minute activity that has the concentrate trait. A living bow appears to be made of wood and constantly sprouts leaves that turn autumnal colors and drop away; it's bowstring is a glowing green line of energy. A wild hunt archer spontaneously generates arrows as needed from its quiver when using a living bow.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Seeking Shots** The wild hunt archer's ranged Strikes and spells with ranged attack rolls ignore their target's [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] condition.</span>
