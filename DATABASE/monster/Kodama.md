# Kodama

A kodama is a type of kami who inhabits a tree. Kodama commonly appear in old Tian forests, especially old-growth forests far removed from civilization. In the Forest of Spirits in Minkai, for example, so many trees are possessed by kodama that a traveler might pass by hundreds, if not thousands, of these beings while journeying through a single acre of woodland.
 Kodama try their utmost to protect their sacred trees, but a single kodama is a minor obstacle to most [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Oni|oni]] or others who have no qualms about desecrating forests or harvesting them for natural resources. Like trees in a forest, kodama are most powerful in great numbers and among other kami, whom they can bolster with their magical straw ropes while distracting strong enemies with their mesmerizing presence.
 On the other hand, kodama bear no ill will toward those who respect their wards, even allowing [[DATABASE/class_/Druid|druids]] and other deferential creatures to dwell within their bounds. They might even subtly guide lost travelers out of the forest or back to safety.

**Ward** (abjuration, divine) Every kami is bound to a ward: a specific animal, plant, object, or location. A kami can merge with or emerge from their ward as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. While merged, the kami can observe their surroundings with their usual senses as well as the senses of their ward, but can't move, communicate with, or control their ward. Additionally, a kami merged with their ward recovers Hit Points each minute as if they spent an entire day resting.
 A kodama's ward is a specific tree.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Spiritual Rope** (abjuration, divine) The kodama spends 1 minute to fashion an enchanted straw rope out of nearby materials. The rope can be wrapped around other kami creatures to protect them from fell forces. A kami who wears a _spiritual rope_ gains resistance 5 to evil damage (though this is usually relevant only if the kami is good-aligned), a +1 status bonus to AC against evil creatures, and a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects from evil creatures.
 A kodama always wears a _spiritual rope_, and they can have one other _spiritual rope_ in existence at a time. Creating a new rope beyond these two releases the magic of one other rope of the kodama's choosing. A _spiritual rope_ around a creature other than a kodama loses its magic after 24 hours or if it's taken outside of the kodama's forest.</span>
