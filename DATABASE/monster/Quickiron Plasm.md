# Quickiron Plasm

Looking much like an ooze, a quickiron plasm is a mass of the rust-red liquid skymetal known as [[DATABASE/equipment/Djezet|djezet]], prized in the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Universe]] for its magic-enhancing properties. Quickiron plasms feed on the residual energies left behind by large expenditures of magical power, which they can detect from miles away.

###  Djezet Extraction

When a quickiron plasm dies, most of the [[DATABASE/equipment/Djezet|djezet]] making up its body becomes inert and useless. However, a skilled alchemist can sometimes extract trace amounts of the valuable skymetal from its remains. This is a 10-minute process that requires the [[DATABASE/feat/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] feat, a proficiency rank of expert or better in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]], and a successful DC 20 Crafting check. A successful attempt produces a single [[DATABASE/equipment/Djezet Dose|djezet dose]] that remains potent for 1 hour before breaking down into a foul-smelling goo. The item has no value if sold due to its temporary nature.
