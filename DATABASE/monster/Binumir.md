# Binumir

Whenever two individuals who share a strong emotional bond perish together, they might rise as a combined spirit known as a binumir. The two individuals' souls partially merge into a singular entity, though each one feels a constant longing for the other. This curse causes a binumir great distress and envy, leading the creature to lash out and attack others. Only the destruction of the binumir will liberate the two spirits and finally give them peace.
 Binumirs commonly appear in places where people die sharing their last moments together, such as in settlements hit by natural disasters. The two spirits of a binumir are distinct. Each half retains the visage of the respective individual that died to later form part of the creature. The spirits typically appear holding hands, but they constantly search for each other. They cry and weep for their lost loved one, unable to recognize the other's presence right beside them.

###  Greater Binumirs

In some cases, several creatures that perish together form a more powerful binumir. These binumirs are generally Large or Huge and have thematic abilities based on the group. For example, a binumir arising from an order of slain monks might have ki abilities or ghostly strikes.
