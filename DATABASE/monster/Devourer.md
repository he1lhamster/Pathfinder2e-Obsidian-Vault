# Devourer

When fiends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest reaches of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horrific undead called devourers that consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies are ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it. Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cages—manifestations of the devourers' most recently consumed souls.

If this counteract attempt succeeds, the trapped soul is released (though the creature remains dead), and the devourer can't use any soul charges from that creature. Devourers are otherwise immune to these spells.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Devour Soul** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (death, divine, necromancy) The devourer touches a creature within reach, dealing 8d6 negative damage (DC 31 basic Fortitude save). If a creature is slain by this attack, its soul becomes trapped within the devourer. While its soul is trapped, a creature can't be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] spell. Destroying the devourer or successfully counteracting Devour Soul (see Spell Deflection above) releases the soul. The devourer can hold only one soul at a time. A soul has 5 soul charges per level of the originating creature (see Soul Spells below). The devourer can expend these charges to cast spells. If the soul is freed and the creature returns to life, the creature is drained 1 for every 5 soul charges expended. If reduced to 0 soul charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life only by powerful magic such as _wish_.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drain Life** (divine, necromancy) When the devourer damages a living creature with its claw Strike, the devourer gains 10 temporary Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]]. Further damage dealt by the devourer increases the condition value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Soul Spells** A devourer casts occult innate spells, but to do so it must expend a number of soul charges equal to the spell's level (similar to casting a spell using charges from a staff). It can heighten any spell to a maximum of 6th level by expending more charges as it Casts the Spell. When encountered, a devourer typically has one trapped soul with 10 soul charges.</span>

###  Forms From Beyond

Regardless of their original ancestry, devourers are always Large—fully 10 feet tall—as the remains of their mortal form strain to contain the evil within. However, their withered and hollowed-out bodies rarely weigh more than a mere 200 pounds.

###  Soul Swallowers

The fact that devourers consume souls makes them particularly hated by the church of [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]] and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomps]] alike.
