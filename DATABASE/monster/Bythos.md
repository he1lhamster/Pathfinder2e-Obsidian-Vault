# Bythos

The bythos is a guardian of space and time, and at all times seeks out those who misuse planar and temporal magic. A bythos is a roughly humanoid creature with four arms and a body made of swirling clouds and mist. Despite its appearance, its body feels like dry stone. A bythos seeks out paradoxes caused by irresponsible planar or dimensional travelers and repairs breaches where the barriers between planes have become thin or damaged. If the mortals responsible remain in the area and cannot be convinced to cease their activities, the bythos has no qualms about removing them. Using its ability to manipulate time, a bythos might cause an opponent to quickly die of old age as time speeds up around them, or cause a target to disappear from time and space.

**Envisioning** When a bythos conveys information, it does so wordlessly through psychic projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have a language. The meaning to non-aeons can be vague and is often mysterious. A bythos can use this ability to communicate flawlessly with any other aeon on the same plane.

If both Strikes hit, the target attempts a DC 37 Fortitude save. Creatures that don't get weaker with age or don't age are immune (GM's discretion). If a creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 4]], [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 4]], and [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 4]] due to Aging Strikes, it dies of old age.
**Success **The creature is unaffected.
**Failure **The creature becomes clumsy 1, drained 1, and enfeebled 1, or increases each of these conditions by 1. This effect is cumulative with other aging strikes from bythoses, to a maximum of clumsy 4, drained 4, and enfeebled 4.

###  Guardians of Time

Bythos aeons have no innate ability to directly enter the mysterious [[DATABASE/plane/Dimension of Time|Dimension of Time]], but many know of the hidden routes in the Great Beyond one can use to travel to this strange realm. A bythos prefers to destroy those who seek entrance to the Dimension of Time rather than risk the knowledge of how to reach it spreading too far.
