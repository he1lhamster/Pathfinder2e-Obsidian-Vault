# Shobhad Sniper

Enemies rarely see a shobhad sniper before the deadly blast of their powerful rifles snatches away the offender's life. Selected from among the most talented enforcers after proving themselves in combat, shobhad snipers learn how to cross the desert sands undetected, combine their powerful ranged weapons with close-combat techniques, and survive Akiton's freezing nights for weeks on end while scouting potential settlements or enemy strongholds.

# Shobhad

**Source** [[Pathfinder 173. Doorway to the Red Star]]
These four-armed humanoids often live as nomads on Akiton. Self-sufficient and able to construct the equipment they need to survive from natural materials, shobhads traditionally avoid large cities and the smaller people of the planet, except to engage in trade. Some shobhads eschew these traditions, finding life in urban centers to be more appealing. Rifts between these shobhads and those who continue to lead nomadic lives in the Akitonian wilderness sometimes lead to clashes when members of the two societies meet.
 Shobhads are highly sought after for their martial expertise, unparalleled knowledge of Akiton's wilds, and unbreakable codes of honor. These warriors may operate independently, in their traditional clans, or in modern mercenary companies that blend ancestral traditions with the needs of modern military freelancers.

###  Shobhad-Neh

Shobhads refer to their collective culture and society as “shobhad-neh” in much the same way humans might refer to themselves collectively as humanity. Most shobhads aren't nearly as powerful as the two examples presented here—though notable for their size, strength, and four arms, the majority of them are ordinary 4th-level creatures.

###  Thasteron Firearms

[[Shobhad Longrifle]] are rare, even among shobhads, although they carry these weapons slightly more often than others in Akiton at large. Shobhad longrifles rely upon an explosive concoction made with a thasteron-based compound rather than gunpowder. Reloads for thasteron firearms are comparable in price to gunpowder-based weapons, but the two types of propulsion are not compatible._
