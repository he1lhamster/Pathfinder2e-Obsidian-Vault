# Giant Maggot

Giant flies lay their eggs on the bodies of larger monsters or livestock. When they hatch, these eggs release squirming maggots the size of human children, ravenous young who voraciously consume any flesh in the immediate vicinity—typically starting with the body upon which they were born.
