# Kasa-Obake

The jerky stomping outside in the middle of the night belongs to the kasa-obake. Though their appearances vary, most kasa-obake resemble an umbrella with a humanoid leg or two protruding where one might expect a handle. It has one or two eyes and can have up to two arms, or no arms at all. Kasa-obake adore wordplay and puns and delight in learning new ones, especially as language evolves over time. Though they enjoy giving living creatures the occasional scare, kasa-obake rarely, if ever, attack.

###  Watchful Sentry

Curious though typically benign, kasa-obake almost always watch for activity. They often attempt to engage lone travelers at night in conversation but are shy in the presence of more than one living creature. Investigators privy to this information often seek out kasa-obake when investigating nighttime incidents. In exchange for a new pun or amusing story, the kasa-obake might reveal what they've witnessed.
