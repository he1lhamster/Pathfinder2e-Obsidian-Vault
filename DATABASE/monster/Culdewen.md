# Culdewen

Perpetually cursed to hunger and failure, a culdewen plies waterways in search of appealing fish to catch—the bigger the better. Of course, this diminutive, emaciated fey calls every living creature a “fish.” Only other fey are exempt, and they tend to consider culdewens lost causes. A culdewen can never find satisfaction. Each time they catch a fish, a magical curse forces them to hunt for an appealing spot to dine—an island, cove, or abandoned dock or shack where they can eat in peace. By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.
A foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack things with their oar, and shake their tiny fists at the sky. Conversation with a culdewen is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of fishing and the weather. Capturing a “fish” gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen capers and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.

**Culdewen's Curse** (curse, enchantment, primal) A culdewen that captures a creature is compelled to immediately retreat to a secluded place to eat, typically journeying by boat. The travel to the secluded place always takes at least 1 day. Their captive is cursed to vanish on the journey—typically being lost in the water or consumed by aquatic creatures—and can be recovered only by a [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] spell or similarly powerful magic.

On a success, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] by the culdewen. [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escaping]] from the restrained condition (DC 25) also allows a creature to remove the hook. While hoisting a creature, the culdewen gains a +20-foot status bonus to their Speeds and is compelled to escape with it (see culdewen's curse above).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Reel In** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate) The culdewen pulls the rope attached to their hook. If they have no creature hooked, the fish hook returns to the culdewen's hand.

Even on a failed save, the curse ends automatically after 1 day.</span>

###  The Curse of Crawley Jack

The damnable curse of the culdewen traces back to the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]], when a bitter old culdewen named Crawley Jack poached a fish from the pool of a powerful fey noble. Short of temper and feeling vindictive, the noble doomed Crawley Jack's people to never consume another fish again. Yet their desire to eat fish never diminished. The curse's punishment is exacted in endless creative ways. A culdewen's catch might be rescued by [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Merfolk|merfolk]], stolen by [[DATABASE/monster/Skum (Ulat-Kini)|skum]], eaten by nipping sharks, or carried away on a piece of driftwood when the culdewen's boat is destroyed in a storm or shipwreck.
