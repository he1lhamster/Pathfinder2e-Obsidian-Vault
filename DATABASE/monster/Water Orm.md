# Water Orm

Legendary creatures lurking in remote lakes, water orms always find their way into the tavern tales of lakeside communities. To some travelers, every lake of respectable size seems to be surrounded by towns full of fishers claiming to have spotted a water orm. These elusive creatures inhabit lakes mainly in cool and gloomy regions. Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of [[DATABASE/monster/Sea Serpent|sea serpents]] and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Linnorm|linnorms]], but no credible link between these creatures has been found.
 Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm sightings usually occur when they can't help but to rise up to the surface to take a peek at someone (or something) particularly unusual on the beach or floating on the water's surface.
 These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the local water orm is responsible, leading to folk tales that caution residents against venturing out alone near the water.
 While most water orms are described as serpentine or long-necked reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of [[DATABASE/monster/Elasmosaurus|elasmosauruses]].

**Slow Metabolism** A water orm can go for 10 years without feeding. Beyond this limit, the water orm's hunger causes it to become [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]], but doesn't otherwise impact its lifespan. A water orm that's slowed as a result of starvation can remove this condition by using Swallow Whole to gulp down a meal.
**Undetectable** (abjuration, primal) A water orm automatically tries to counteract any detection, revelation, or scrying divination attempted against it, using its [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] modifier for the counteract check.

While in this form, a water orm's swim Speed increases to 600 feet, it automatically succeeds at [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Swim|swim]], and it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks in water. A water orm can remain in this form for 8 hours, but it can't enter salt water when using this ability. A water orm can return to its normal form using a single action which has the concentrate trait.</span>

###  Local Orms

People who live by the lakes inhabited by legendary water orms have a tendency to give local lake monsters names that sound somewhat homey or even adorable. As a result, such creatures are often regarded as local mascots or goodluck charms—particularly in lakeside settlements that depend on fishing as a significant income source.
