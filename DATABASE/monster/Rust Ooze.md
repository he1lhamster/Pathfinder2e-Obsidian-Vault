These reddish-brown globs wriggle through sewers and other waterways in search of iron pipes, metal trash, and other objects that rust.

###  Rust Oozes and Rust Monsters

While no one is sure how the first rust ooze came to be, some theorize that Hubert Brunt, an ooze researcher at Blythir College, spilled some proto-ooze on a [[DATABASE/monster/Rust Monster|rust monster]] antennae a colleague was studying. The urban legend says it consumed the antennae and absorbed the rust monster's powers, then consumed all of the metal instruments in the lab before a frightened attendant hastily washed the animated muck down the drain.
