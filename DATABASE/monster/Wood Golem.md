# Wood Golem

Wood golems are often given vaguely humanoid shapes, almost as if cobbled together from scraps of firewood and discarded burls. It's less common for wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don't bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids often feel when facing a carrion or flesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic match between the wood golem's appearance and such locations.

###  Wood Golem Components

Unless they are badly damaged by magical fire, the rare woods and exquisitely carved blocks used to craft a wood golem retain much of their value after the golem's destruction. Carpenters, sculptors, and even some merchants will pay a fair price for the remains of a defeated wood golem. However, if the golem belonged to a rich and powerful person and its fragments are thus recognizable, it may be more difficult to find willing buyers
