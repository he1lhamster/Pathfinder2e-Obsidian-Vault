# Teraphant

Though teraphants may resemble an elephant from afar, teraphants lack the long incisors that mark other pachyderms. Instead, tusk-like horns grow from their forehead. Native to Vudra, teraphants are occasionally found in Jalmeray and Nex, brought as rare gifts for nobles.
 These placid herbivores' resonant psychic powers warn them against creatures approaching with ill intent. Faced with strong, sustained emotions, teraphants may find themselves responding in kind, which sometimes drive them into a fearsome rage against aggressive foes.

###  Teraphant Hunters

Few things threaten teraphants other than the Vudrani hunters known as apathets. Apathets rely on emotion-deadening alchemical elixirs and spells to get close to their prey. Some apathets sell teraphant horns to those who believe their horns are the source of these creatures' psychic powers; others serve rajahs who wish to enslave a teraphant.
