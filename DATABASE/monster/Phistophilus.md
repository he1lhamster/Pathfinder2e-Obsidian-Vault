description: "Contract devils are clerks, scribes, and bureaucrats of Hell rarely\
  \ found outside the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential\
  \ contracts, tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their\
  \ worldly desires. If a target is desirable enough, a phistophilus can offer contracts\
  \ for prices seemingly lesser than their soul all at once, though in this case,\
  \ the devil carefully manipulates the price to drive the signatory toward the forces\
  \ of law and evil, and therefore ultimately to Hell anyway. Contract devils are\
  \ tall creatures with skin tones that range from bronze to crimson and large curving\
  \ horns extending from their bodies, over which they often drape favored or important\

The infernal contracts created by contract devils are not the only ways a devil can engage a mortal in a binding agreement, but they are the most convenient. Other devils must perform complex rituals or jump through bureaucratic hoops to organize a contract with a mortal, and in most cases the easiest solution for devils in this situation is to simply enlist the aid of a contract devil.
