<span class="in-box-ability">**Wounded Arm** Jurgrindor's left arm is dreadfully wounded, courtesy of Amiri's greatsword. The discomfort of this wound causes Jurgrindor to take a –2 circumstance penalty to his Armor Class and Strikes (these modifications are included in his stats). At the end of each of his turns, Jurgrindor must succeed at a DC 12 flat check or the wound begins to bleed again, dealing him 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]. He can't use [[DATABASE/monsterability/Catch Rock|Catch Rock]] or [[DATABASE/monsterability/Throw Rock|Throw Rock]] (as typical giants) until he's healed back to full hit points.</span>
