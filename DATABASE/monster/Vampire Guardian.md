**Children of the Night** (divine, enchantment, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves, but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Mist Escape <span class="action-icon">4</span> ** **Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. **Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.</span>

Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. A vampire guardian's giant bat form's fangs have a +21 attack bonus and deal 2d6+11 piercing damage.

* Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.

</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Create Spawn** (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Dominate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] at will as a divine innate spell (DC 26). Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drink Blood** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, necromancy) **Requirement** A [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. **Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] and the vampire guardian regains 13 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.
 A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]** A vampire guardian deals 1d6 extra precision damage to [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] creatures.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Turn to Mist** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [[DATABASE/spell/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]] spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing]] while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.</span>
