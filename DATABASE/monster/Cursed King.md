# Cursed King

A cursed king is a grotesque mockery of ambition. When treasonous advisors, false prophets, and rebel leaders are captured by evil rulers, they're subjected to all manner of torture and humiliation before their eventual executions. But the cursed king isn't even granted dignity in death, as after their beheading, a desiccated animal head is sewn onto their neck. These horrific mummies are then dressed in fine linens and jewelry befitting royalty—a permanent warning of what happens to those who seek to rise above their station.
 A cursed king is bound in servitude to the ruler against whom they once fought, forced to act as a bodyguard. Even the death of their maker gives no reprieve, as they guard the true monarch's tomb forever.

As long as that creature remains cursed, it can't remove or decrease the value of the stupefied condition in any way. Afflicted creatures must attempt the saving throw again every 24 hours, increasing the stupefied condition by 1 on a failure or 2 on a critical failure. If the condition ever increases past stupefied 4, they transform, body and mind, into the same animal as the cursed king's head, similar to the critical failure effect of [[DATABASE/spell/Baleful Polymorph|baleful polymorph]].</span>

###  Artful Punishment

The cursed king's creator can take its head from any common animal in the region, but the creator typically chooses a specific head for its symbolic significance. For instance, a creator might choose a jackal's head if the cursed king was a clever tactician, a hippo's if they were formidable on the battlefield, or a giant cobra's for those who betrayed the regime from within. Aesthetics are often also considered, although it isn't unheard of for a cursed king to have the head of a more ignoble creature as an additional punishment.
