# Lurker In Light

These malicious and strange fey appear as fairies about 2 feet tall, with insectile wings, large eyes, and bulbous heads. They slaughter and cause mischief in a pattern only their alien intellect understands, but they've been seen to take particular umbrage against dwarves, gnomes, and creatures who live in darkness. With their grudges and pursuit of their own wicked and sadistic whims, lurkers in light deftly overturn the conventional wisdom that creatures associated with light are benign and friendly.
 While lurkers in light are fey and have ties to the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]], these creatures are often found elsewhere in the Great Beyond. They are particularly fond of invading the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] to bring light to those who dwell there-not to help, but to spread misery and pain among those to whom light is agonizing.

###  Greater Ritual Gates

Well-versed and knowledgeable lurkers in light can lead groups of their kind in a more advanced Ritual Gate to enable travel to other planes, rather than just summoning. Doing so requires the sacrifice of a creature of equal or greater size to the lurker in light who wishes to travel the planes. Multiple lurkers in light can travel in this way, but this requires multiple sacrifices. The creation of a greater Ritual Gate is a 1-hour activity, at the end of which all affected lurkers in light travel to the same plane, chosen from the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], one of the Elemental Planes, or the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]].
