# Lomori Sprout

Lomori sprouts are passionate gardeners who closely tend new growth on the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]]. Incredibly industrious, they lovingly guide young plants into elaborate constructions and patterns, forming tree tunnels, spiraling fields of flowers, complex hedge mazes, towering tapestries of interwoven bamboo, and other dizzying creations. Lomori sprouts meticulously collect the trimmings, seeds, and debris from the flora in their care. They plant the seeds to yield new growth and frenetically weave the rest into nests, spheres, and other simple objects. They're shy and skittish, often losing themselves in their labors, but they're always friendly to those who treat their gardens with respect.
 
Lomoris are [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Aeon|aeon]] spirits dispatched to the elemental planes long ago to pursue the act of creation. While most of the aeons dispatched to the other elemental planes performed their duties and rejoined their aeon brethren, those on the Plane of Wood lingered, becoming trapped as the plane receded. Over the ages, they adapted and evolved into lomoris. Today, lomoris have more in common with the other denizens of the Plane of Wood than they do with their aeon ancestors.
 Lomori sprouts, much like [[DATABASE/ancestry/Conrasu|conrasus]], have a central black sphere, known as a lomori's core, that functions as their primary body and consciousness. Where conrasus forge a sturdy exoskeleton, lomoris cultivate a tall mound of prairie grass surrounding their core, which easily grows to be 2–3 times the core's height. The lomori shapes the mound as it grows, creating protective layers to guard their core and forming other useful appendages. Most lomoris have six intricately detailed, crab-like legs of wood that emerge from the lower half of their core, allowing them to rapidly scuttle across the ground or climb trees.

###  Get Off My Lawn!

Lomori sprouts are industrious yet skittish, halting their work only to hide from intruders—if they can be bothered to stop at all. They're ceaseless in their efforts, often working together in large groups to tend vast swaths of land. Nothing rouses a lomori sprout to violence faster than damaging their garden or other creations.
