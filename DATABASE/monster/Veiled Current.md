# Veiled Current

Often considered cousins of [[DATABASE/monster/Invisible Stalker|phades]], veiled currents are loose veils of wind who catch prey within their folds.
**Recall Knowledge - Elemental ([[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]])**: DC 24
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 22
**Specific Lore**: DC 19

This thereafter has the same effect as if the veiled current had [[DATABASE/monsterability/Engulf|Engulfed]] the creature (DC 26, 1d8+8 bludgeoning, [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC 26, Rupture 17). As engulfing a creature is a hostile action, the veiled current is [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] instead of [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] every round it has a creature engulfed.</span>
