# Owb Prophet

An owb who comes into contact and is chosen by one of the Forsaken gains a fragment of that demigod's power and forges a permanent connection with it. This act transforms the owb into a larger, more powerful creature and imbues it with the power of divine transference, allowing the owb to gain followers and grant spells to them. These are owb prophets.
 Owb prophets may have some portion of the Forsaken's power, but they use their authority to gain more sway over calignis and other worshippers.
