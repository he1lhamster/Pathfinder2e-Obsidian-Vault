# Shoggti

Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm victims, bringing them back to the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] where they are enslaved for unknown—but no doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lamprey-like mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its forehead that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Braincloud** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (attack, enchantment, mental, occult, open) The shoggti caresses a creature with a tentacle and supernaturally erodes the creature's capability for thought as it does so.

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
