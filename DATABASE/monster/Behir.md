# Behir

The behir is a massive, serpentine beast with never fewer than a dozen short legs, each ending in three hooked talons. A behir can live to 80 years, but most perish far younger to violence. Fully grown, a behir is 40 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds.

These attacks count toward the behir's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the behir makes all of its attacks. If the behir moves half its Speed or less during a Claw Storm, that movement doesn't trigger reactions. The behir can't use Claw Storm if it has a creature wrapped in its coils. At the end of Claw Storm, it drifts downward up to 60 feet to the ground, landing softly and taking no damage from the fall.

###  Hatred of Dragons

Some scholars have speculated that behirs are somehow related to [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Chromatic|blue dragons]], citing their reptilian features, lightning breath, and ability to speak the [[DATABASE/language/Draconic|Draconic]] language, but such scholars would do well to keep such opinions from behirs they encounter in the field. Nothing infuriates a behir faster than likening it to a dragon!
