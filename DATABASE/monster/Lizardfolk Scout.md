# Lizardfolk Scout

Iruxi scouts are the lizardfolk most often encountered by adventurers, for these explorers and hunters spend most of their lives on the move, constantly patrolling the territories held by their enclave. If intruders are driven off, it is the responsibility of the iruxi scouts to track them, observe them, and learn their ways and weaknesses so as to report back to the community and aid in the defense against potential reprisals.
