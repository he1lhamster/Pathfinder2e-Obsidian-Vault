<span class="in-box-ability">**Enraged Cunning** A murder of crows can get past most barriers to hound their prey. Simple latches, unsecured chimney flues, loosely shuttered windows, and similar obstacles rarely keep a murder away. A murder of crows automatically bypasses many of these simple obstructions and can attempt a DC 25 Thievery check to get through more complex obstructions (such as closed windows or simple barricades).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Swarming Beaks** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The crows' angry pecking deals 2d8 piercing damage to each enemy in the swarm's space (DC 28 basic Reflex save). A creature that critically fails its save is blinded for 1d6 rounds as the crows focus their attacks on the target's vulnerable face.</span>
