# Shaukeen

Perhaps the most perverse asuras of them all, shaukeens particularly delight in causing the downfall of those who give them succor, shelter, and most of all, schooling. Many a teacher has come across a shaukeen disguised as a small child of exceptional talents or curiosity and taken them under their wing, only to be beguiled into ruin. This diminutive asura's cleverness is disproportionate to their size; they ask probing questions and coax their prey into decisions that lead to heresy, furthering the collapse of order and decency. When the world turns on the shaukeen's mentor, the asura is gone—but not very far, for they love hiding unseen and watching the torment and destruction of their mentors.
