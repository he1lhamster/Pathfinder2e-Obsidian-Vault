# Gray Ooze

These dangerous oozes are the bane of any who travel through swamps, marshes, or damp caves. Easily masquerading as pools of clear water or patches of wet stone, gray oozes lie in wait for unwary victims to reach down for a drink or step into what appears to be a puddle, then lash out with whiplike pseudopods to ensnare and consume their hapless prey.

###  Gray Ooze Adaptability

Gray oozes have shown the astounding ability to overcome environmental challenges by changing their qualities. For example, some gray oozes have adapted to fully aquatic environments, replacing their movement with a swim speed and gaining a paralytic poison similar to that of gelatinous cubes. Other gray oozes have become charged with psychic energy, gaining the ability to cause nearby creatures to become [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] for a short time.
