<span class="in-box-ability">**Magaambya Scar** A physical attack on Taviah that scores a critical hit exacerbates the injury in her wounded leg; in addition to the other effects of the critical hit, Taviah is [[Stunned]].</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> iron claw +26 [+22/+18] (agile, cold iron, magical, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d12+12 slashing plus [[Grab]] and paralyzing claws</span>**Occult Innate Spells** DC 30, attack +22; **6th** _[[False Life]]_, _[[Feeblemind]]_, _[[Haste]]_, _[[Shadow Blast]]_; **Constant** **(5th)** _[[Tongues]]_
<span class="in-box-ability">**Bonds of Iron** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (attack, conjuration, occult) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Taviah can cause a cage built of cold-iron fingernails to spring from nothingness around a target at a range of up to 30 feet, attempting an [[Athletics]] check to [[Grapple]] against the target's Fortitude DC. If the target has a weakness to [[Cold Iron]], Taviah gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Unlike a normal Grapple, Taviah doesn't need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature [[Escape]] (DC 29), causing the cage to crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by attacking it; it has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drain Thoughts** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divination, mental, occult) **Requirements** A [[Grabbed]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Restrained]], [[Unconscious]], or willing creature is within Taviah's reach; **Effect** Taviah seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an [[Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[Stupefied]] (stupefied 2 if Taviah's Athletics check is a critical success), and Taviah regains 18 Hit Points, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to Taviah but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, Taviah views one of the victim's memories, and can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory she views as a 4th-level [[Modify Memory]] spell. A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.
 A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose until Taviah is destroyed, becoming permanently unconscious. While unconscious, its stupefied condition doesn't decrease.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Mental Rebirth** (curse, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult) Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes [[Controlled]] by the vetalarana and loses the [[Stupefied]] and [[Unconscious]] conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.
After 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose. When the characters arrive, Taviah has no comatose creatures to transfer her consciousness to.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Paralyzing Claws** (incapacitation, necromancy, occult) Any living creature hit by Taviah's claw Strike must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or become [[Paralyzed]]. The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Rend]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw</span>
