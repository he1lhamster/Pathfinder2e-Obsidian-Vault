# Vegetable Lamb

Vegetable lambs are gaining popularity as the first elemental to be summoned by spellcasters in training, as they're docile until provoked and easy to control. Casters must take care, however, to not let them germinate in the [[Material Plane]]; they're a highly invasive species that can devour an entire forest within a decade.
 The healing and nourishing food that grows from vegetable lambs is appealing for adventurers and sedentary magical scholars alike. The taste is similar to the plants of the same kind that grow on Golarion, but not entirely. Many have noted that there's a slight similarity to meat—a bit of umami one wouldn't find in an ordinary flower.

**Nature's Bounty** (healing, plant, primal, vitality) Each day, a vegetable lamb grows 1d4 edible flowers (such as artichoke, broccoli, or dandelion) among the green cotton covering its body. These vegetables can be picked without hurting the lamb. A living creature can eat the vegetable with an Interact action to regain 1d6+4 Hit Points.
