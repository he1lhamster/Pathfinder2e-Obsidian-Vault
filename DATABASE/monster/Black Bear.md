# Black Bear

Contrary to the name, black bears can be cinnamon or even blond in coloration, depending on which hue is most beneficial for surviving in their local environment. Regardless of their coloration, they are opportunistic eaters who gain sustenance from berries and nuts just as often as from fish and smaller mammals. They steal food when they find it, including from humanoid camps. Although they are predators, black bears are more timid than other bears. Unless defending themselves or their young, black bears often avoid conflict or fight only until they can retreat.
