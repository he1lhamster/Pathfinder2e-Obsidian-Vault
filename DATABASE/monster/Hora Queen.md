description: 'Sumbreivas are the [[DATABASE/plane/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy
  Plane''s]] unstoppable hunters, tracking down and destroying other creatures on
  their plane for sport and practice. Occasionally they pass through a rift or are
  brought to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] via [[DATABASE/ritual/Planar
  Binding|planar binding]] , where they collect living souls to display as trophies.<br/><br/>
  Sumbreivas gather at Night Lodges, where they train and display their soul trophies,
  which appear as floating wisps of blue energy. The more formidable the soul, the
  more intense the blue glow that emanates from it. Sumbreivas in lodges periodically
  raid the Material Plane on a Night Hunt. Over the course of one night, the sumbreivas
  from that lodge split up and compete to see who can capture the most brilliant souls
  as trophies. The winner of the Night Hunt leads the lodge until the next hunt.<br/><br/>
  Night Lodges are ranked against each other by the accomplishments of the hunters
  within. All sumbreivas have the ultimate goal of capturing a soul worthy of being
  placed in the Twilight Lodge, reserved for the truly elite souls and hunters.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall

# Hora Queen

Hora queens rule over wide stretches of land, nourishing and protecting native animals and plants. Most hora queens watch over their regions in pairs: one summer and one winter, or one autumn and one spring.

**Summer Bound** During the winter months, a summer hora can't take reactions, is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]], and can't reduce their sickened condition below 1.
**Tied to the Land** A summer hora queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest or hilly plain. For 3 months around the summer solstice, the environment is supernaturally resilient, allowing the queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals that would harm the environment, such as [[DATABASE/ritual/Blight|blight]], with a +27 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 7. For the 3 months around the winter solstice, however, her warded region becomes twisted or unhealthy unless a winter hora queen is present.

###  Other Horai

The statistics here are for summer horai, but you can represent the other three types of horai with the following alterations. Winter horai have resistance to cold rather than to fire and Strikes that deal cold damage rather than fire damage. Similarly, autumn horai have resistance to negative energy and Strikes that deal negative damage; spring horai have no resistance and Strikes that deal positive damage (which only harms undead and creatures with [[DATABASE/monsterability/Negative Healing|negative healing]], as normal). Winter horai have the Winter Bound ability which impairs them during the summer months, and winter horai queens reverse the effects of their Tied to the Land ability (their land is healthy during the winter and withers during the summer). Similarly, autumn and spring horai are impaired during the opposing months, and their queens' Tied to the Land abilities change accordingly. Winter horai have Winter's Rescue rather than Summer's Salvation, which gives a +4 status bonus during the month of the winter solstice (Kuthona on Golarion), a +2 status bonus on the months before and after it (Neth and Abadius), a +1 bonus on most other months, and no benefit during the three summer months. Similarly, autumn and spring horai have reactions that grant a +4 status bonus during the month of their equinox, a +2 status bonus on the months just before and after, a +1 status bonus on other months, and no benefit during the opposing equinox and the months just before and after.
