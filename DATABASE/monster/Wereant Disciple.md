**Hive Mind** (divination, primal) Wereants operate with a shared hive intelligence. While within telepathic range of at least one other wereant, a wereant disciple gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative checks, Perception checks, and saving throws against mental effects. If one wereant is aware of a combatant, all members of the hive mind within telepathic range are aware of it.
**Insect Empathy** (divination, primal) The wereant can communicate with insects.

Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true wereant's natural form is their hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, they use their original humanoid size, lose their jaws and claw Strikes, and gain a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by their mandibles. In animal shape, they take the form of a Medium giant ant, gain a climb Speed of 20 feet, gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grab]] on their mandibles Strike, and lose their weapon Strikes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Curse of the Wereant** (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse affects only humanoids; **Saving Throw** DC 34 Fortitude.

These Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage if the disciple is above the target. If the wereant began this action [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]], they remain hidden until after this ability's Strikes. Both attacks count toward the disciple's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both Strikes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Moon Frenzy** (polymorph, primal, transmutation) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the wereant must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape, becomes one size larger, increases their reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of their mandibles Strike by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the wereant returns to humanoid form and is [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] for 2d4 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Staggering Blow** A creature damaged by the wereant disciple's carapace fist Strike must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] (stunned 2 on a critical failure).
