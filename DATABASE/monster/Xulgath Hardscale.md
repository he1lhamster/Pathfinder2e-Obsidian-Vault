<span class="in-box-ability">**Hardscale Shield Stance** A hardscale always has their shield raised as if they had used the Raise a Shield action, as long as they meet that action's requirements.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Powerful Stench** (aura, olfactory) 30 feet. A creature that enters the area must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [[Sickened]], and on a critical failure, the creature is also [[Slowed]] for as long as it is sickened. While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all [[Xulgath]] stenches for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Shield Warden** If the hardscale has their shield raised, they can Shield Block when an attack is made against an adjacent ally. If they do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of the hardscale.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Aggressive Block <span class="action-icon">4</span> ** **Trigger** The hardscale uses the Shield Block reaction, and the opponent that triggered Shield Block is adjacent to the hardscale and is not more than one size larger than it; **Effect** The hardscale makes an [[Athletics]] check to [[Shove]] the opponent. This Shove doesn't increase the hardscale's multiple attack penalty. If they roll a critical failure, they get a failure instead. If they roll a success, they get a critical success instead.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Attack of Opportunity]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** </span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Shield Block]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** At the beginning of each of their turns, the hardscale receives an additional reaction that they can use only for Shield Block.</span>
