###  Web Lurker Lair

Whether alone or in a group, web lurkers hunt in forests, swamps, or scrubby hill lands, constructing structures from their webs high up in trees or within craggy, high canyons, and they surround their territory with traps and snares constructed of the same webbing and natural material.
