<span class="in-box-ability">**Construct Armor** Like normal objects, a crimson worm statue has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once a crimson worm statue is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 22.</span>

It can strike up to once with its jaws and any number of times with its tail. Each attack counts toward the worm's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after it makes all its attacks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vomit Worms** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (conjuration) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The statue disgorges a [[DATABASE/monster/Bore Worm Swarm|bore worm swarm]] into an adjacent 10-foot-by-10-foot space. Creatures in the swarm's area are immediately affected by the bore worm swarm's Swarming Bites, after which the bore worm swarm rolls initiative and acts independently before disappearing after 1d6 minutes.</span>
