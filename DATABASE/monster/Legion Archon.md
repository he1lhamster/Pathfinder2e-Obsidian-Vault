# Legion Archon

Despite their flaming blades and heavy armor, legion archons are the diplomats of peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual benefit rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to fight against fiendish powers—especially fiends that embody the sin of wrath—legion archons don’t hesitate in battle, mounting offensives under divine commanders like Iomedae.

On a failure, they take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls, spell rolls, and damage rolls against any other target while in the aura for 24 hours or until they damage the archon, whichever comes first. On a critical failure, they can’t use hostile actions against any other target while in the area for 24 hours or until they damage the archon, whichever comes first.

A legion archon can throw its flame of justice as a ranged weapon. If disarmed or thrown, the flame of justice vanishes after landing or dealing damage and reappears in the legion archon’s hands again instantly. On a critical hit, the fire damage from the flame of justice deals maximum damage (6 on the d6) before being doubled for the critical hit, and the target takes 1d10 persistent fire damage.</span>
