# Gelatinous Cube

Found underground or in dungeons, these quivering cubes of slime continuously scour their domain for food. The acid in their bodies is weak enough that many gelatinous cubes still contain the gear of their victims, as they’re unable to break them down.
**Recall Knowledge - Ooze ([[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]])**: DC 18
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 16
**Specific Lore**: DC 13

**Perception** +5; motion sense 60 feet, no vision
**Skills** [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] +11 (+13 to Shove)

**Motion Sense** A gelatinous cube can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement.
 **Transparent** A gelatinous cube is so clear that it’s difficult to spot. A successful DC 23 Perception check is required to notice a stationary cube, and a creature must be Searching to attempt this check. A creature that walks into the cube is automatically Engulfed (this usually causes the GM to call for initiative).
