# Procyal (Raccoon Agathion)

As the most whimsical and playful of the agathions, procyals are the most likely to be encountered on the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], teaching deep philosophical lessons and delivering wisdom through pranks and impersonations. Mischievous and playful, these raccoon-headed humanoids love to socialize with mortals and learn about their societies. Unlike their mortal counterparts, Procyals' fur starts off dark russet in color, giving way to gray and white flecks on their muzzles as they grow older. Only procyal leaders boast the stark gray and black coloration of a true raccoon. Those who recognize procyals' age and wisdom treat these creatures with great respect.
 Whatever their natural appearance, procyals make excellent shapeshifters and can assume the form of any humanoid that they've encountered. They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community, often appearing as someone's trusted mentor to deliver an important message in a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They're not above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they've assumed, especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson. Raccoon agathions prefer to use a blade if forced into combat, but they're prepared to use their claws and fight dirty if necessary.

Receiving and growing from such a lesson requires at least 10 minutes of interaction with the Procyal but can take much longer. A character who learns from the procyal's lesson gains the benefits of the [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] reaction from the procyal once during the next month. Afterwards, they become immune to this effect from all procyals.</span>

###  Procyals and Societies

While born from the souls of the enlightened like other agathions, procyals derive their core value of whimsy from truly understanding the delicate balance between society and the individual. These clever celestials prefer enabling communities under attack to extinguish the evil threats and thrive on their own.
