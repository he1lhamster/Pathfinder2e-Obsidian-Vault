<span class="in-box-ability">**Golem Antimagic** harmed by acid (9d10, 2d10 from areas or persistent damage); healed by plant (area 2d10 HP); slowed by electricity</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Repair Mode** When the golem is at 0 HP, it isn't destroyed. Instead, it enters repair mode, during which it is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]], can't take reactions, and can take only the Self-Repair action. Once it has more than 30 HP, it can use any type of action and can use reactions, though it remains slowed 1 and can't take any reactions until the start of its next turn. If a critical hit with an adamantine weapon reduces the golem to 0 HP, or if such a weapon hits it while it's already at 0 HP, then the golem is destroyed.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vulnerable to Dispelling and Shape Wood** The golem can be targeted by [[DATABASE/spell/Disjunction|disjunction]], [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]], and [[DATABASE/spell/Shape Wood|shape wood]]. If targeted by such a spell of 9th level or higher, the golem has its resistance to physical damage lowered to 10 and is slowed 1 (or slowed 2 if in repair mode) for 1d4 rounds. During this time, if the golem is reduced to 0 HP while already in repair mode, it is destroyed.</span>

A creature can try to bar the way by attempting a DC 43 Fortitude save.
 **Critical Success** The creature takes no damage and its armor takes no damage.
 **Success** The golem halts its movement and cannot enter the creature's square.
 **Failure** The resisting creature is damaged and its armor takes damage as if hit by the golem's staff.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Self-Repair** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate) The golem repairs itself, regaining 30 Hit Points.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vent Splinters** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (arcane, evocation, fire) The golem vents a 30-foot cone of fiery splinters from its internal forge. This deals 13d6 piercing damage to all creatures in the cone (DC 38 basic Reflex save). Creatures who fail the save also take 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]] (4d6 persistent fire damage on a critical failure). The golem can't use Vent Splinters again for 1d4 rounds.</span>
