# Rhu-Chalik

The alien entities known as rhu-chaliks serve as scouts for a conglomeration of deep-space conquerors called the Dominion of the Black. Their masters use them as spies, tasking them with harvesting the thoughts and memories of sentient creatures into a vast repository of knowledge designed to eventually unravel every secret of existence.
 Also called void wanderers, rhu-chaliks can survive the depths of space indefinitely. They are extremely long-lived and capable of traversing the vastness of space between worlds. Rhu-chaliks prefer to work alone in order to reduce potential overlap in their mind predations. The furtive beings are calculating and infinitely patient, seeking only the most exceptional minds to cast beyond the stars to their masters.

The target creature is deeply disoriented by this procedure, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]] for 1 day afterward. If the creature is revived or moved away from the rhu-chalik during the process, Void Transmission fails and the target is unaffected.</span>

###  Connoisseurs of Thoughts

Rhu-chaliks lack both mouths and digestive systems. Instead they gain sustenance from the thoughts and emotions of sentient beings. Each emotion has a distinctive flavor to rhu-chaliks and, as this feeding doesn't harm the food source, rhu-chaliks often dine repeatedly upon their favorite minds. Some rhu-chaliks even incite various emotions in their prey to elicit new tastes for their mental banquets.
