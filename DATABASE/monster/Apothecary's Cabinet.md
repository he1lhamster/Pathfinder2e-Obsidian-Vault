<span class="in-box-ability">**Construct Armor** Like normal objects, an apothecary's cabinet has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an apothecary's cabinet is reduced to fewer than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 20.</span>
