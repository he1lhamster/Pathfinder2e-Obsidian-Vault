 **Critical Failure** The creature is knocked out of time, which ceases to flow around the creature for 1 round. It is invulnerable to all damage, it can't be targeted or affected by anything, and no rounds elapse for any timed durations, conditions, afflictions, and other effects it has. The target can't act and remains fixed in place, defying gravity if applicable.

###  Enemies Across Time

Engineers who develop clockwork clock towers often draw unwelcome attention from creatures who protect the flow of time and don't like mortal machines meddling with it. These inventors might be attacked by [[Hound of Tindalos]] or even [[Ravager Of Tindalos]].
