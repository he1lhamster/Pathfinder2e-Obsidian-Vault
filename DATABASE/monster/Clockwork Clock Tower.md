# Clockwork Clock Tower

Clockworks are machines built by engineers and augmented with magic. A clock tower reconfigured as an animated clockwork can rotate slices of time.

The target can't act and remains fixed in place, defying gravity if applicable.

###  Enemies Across Time

Engineers who develop clockwork clock towers often draw unwelcome attention from creatures who protect the flow of time and don't like mortal machines meddling with it. These inventors might be attacked by [[DATABASE/monster/Hound of Tindalos|hounds of Tindalos]] or even [[DATABASE/monster/Ravager Of Tindalos|ravagers of Tindalos]].
