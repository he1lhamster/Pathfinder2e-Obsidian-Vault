# Iroran Mummy

Some enlightened members of the [[DATABASE/deity/Irori|Iroran]] faith, particularly monks, are so aware of their own bodily processes they can sense their approaching death from old age. Pinpointing the occurrence to the exact hour, a chosen few employ a method of self-mummification. These masters of life and death leave behind their bodies to watch over Irori's temples.

A creature that succeeds at the save is temporarily immune for 24 hours. If the Iroran mummy takes a hostile action, the aura of peace is suppressed and its effects end for anyone already affected.

###  Iroran Preservation

[[DATABASE/deity/Irori|Irorans]] closely guard the process of creating their mummies. I have gleaned that it involves rituals of fasting and a diet of certain poisonous nuts and teas used as preservatives. The monk must also be in a trance-like meditation at the moment of death. Physical movement and battle strain a dead body, and long stretches of inactivity might turn skin and bone brittle. Many Iroran mummies treat themselves by rubbing their skin with alchemical oils and wrapping their bodies in magically treated cotton or linen. Choosing a suitable resting spot as well as trying to maintain this resting place is equally important. Upon awakening, Iroran mummies often discover they've become a nesting place for birds or bats or acquired a thin layer of moss.
