# Giant Anaconda

The monstrous giant anaconda is capable of swallowing whole creatures as big as horses—to say nothing of their riders. Although novice bushwhackers watch out for snakes that might drop on them from the jungle canopy above, giant anacondas are most commonly encountered in ponds and rivers, where they feed on prey including manatees and capybaras.
