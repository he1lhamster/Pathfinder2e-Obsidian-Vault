# Radiant Warden

The enigmatic and strange radiant wardens were constructed thousands of years ago to protect observatories and scholars against the incursion of alien aggressors from the Dominion of the Black. Over time, their roles as guardians expanded to include watching over any region where the laws of time and space have worn thin, particularly near portals and permanent gates between planets, planes, or dimensions.
 Named for both the radial nature of the concentric rings that make up their bodies as well as the glowing radiance of their attacks, radiant wardens carry on their orders, defending sites from invasion with single-minded purpose.

###  Ancient Intellects

Each radiant warden's animating force consists of raw positive energy fused to the soul of a willing sacrifice—usually an astronomer or scholar near the end of their natural life. Focused now on protecting a site from any intrusion— including by curious archaeologists or adventurers—a radiant warden might pause before an attack if approached peacefully. Unfortunately, these constructs are prone to speaking in vague riddles or complex mathematical diatribes that can be as confusing as they are intriguing; often, discussions break down as frustration mounts on either side (or both).
