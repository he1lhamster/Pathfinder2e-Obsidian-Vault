description: 'Gennayns are minor genies who often serve as emissaries and messengers
  for greater elemental beings. While many find purpose in this humble mission, their
  true calling and interest is in the arts.<br/><br/> They often appear as miniature,
  athletic humanoids with wisps of elemental energy continually dissipating from their
  bodies. These elemental energies often reflect their emotions and attuned element.
  Gennayns are also fond of ostentatious rings, amulets, and armbands.<br/><br/> Gennayns
  eagerly assist powerful beings who reward and treat them well, but they''re just
  as quick to abandon those they consider boring, stingy, or abusive. Beings who destroy
  artwork or mistreat artists will earn their eternal wrath.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall

# Ghalzarokh (Tyranny Demon)

Ghalzarokh demons, also known as tyranny demons, form from the souls of cruel autocrats. These demons subjugate weaker fiends. After amassing an army, a ghalzarokh begins a chaotic spree of bloody conquest.

###  Demon Thralls

Ghalzarokhs are bullies who prefer numerous thralls to allies. These demons loathe owing any other being a favor and serve stronger creatures only with the expectation of rich reward. A ghalzarokh can rarely be found without a fiendish entourage or army (such as a demon throng). They prefer “pacts” with “lesser” demons, usually offering only a feeble guarantee to allow the weaker fiend's continued existence.
