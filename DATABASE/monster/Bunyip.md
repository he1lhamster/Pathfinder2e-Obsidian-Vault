# Bunyip

Bunyips are dangerous aquatic predators that resemble a cross between a shark and a seal. Found in freshwater inlets or saltwater coves worldwide, bunyips hunt where prey is plentiful, often to the consternation of coastal residents and fisherfolk.
 Despite their outlandish appearance and tendency to defend their territory with loud, bellowing roars that echo for great distances, bunyips are very rarely sighted by humanoids, leaving many to question their existence. For hundreds of years, bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression.
 In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the chum and garbage discarded by fishing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.

When it does, its teeth shrink and its Jaws Strike doesn’t deal the 1d6 persistent bleed damage. It can choose to gain either a long snake tail, granting its tail Strike reach 10 feet and Grab, or squat crocodile legs, increasing its land Speed to 20 feet. If it uses Shift Form again, the bunyip can return to normal or switch between a long tail or crocodile legs.</span>

###  Bunyip Treasure

Bunyips have no use for treasure, and do not actively collect it, but the floors of their lairs are sometimes littered with the possessions of their humanoid victims. A bunyip's teeth can be collected and sold (most bunyips have about 50 teeth at any one time). Alternatively, due to their elusiveness and fabled nature, a high-quality taxidermic bunyip could easily command a high price from a collector.
