# Shadowforged Guardian

Shadowforged guardians are created through the intricate and dangerous process of siphoning penumbral energies and matter from the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] and then binding them to a physical skeleton of wood and metal.
 The first shadowforged guardians were created thousands of years ago in Nidal and were usually crafted in the likeness of that nation's patron deity, [[DATABASE/deity/Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthon]]. Shadowforged guardians are understandably in high demand; unfortunately, only the person who speaks a special word or phrase at the moment of the construct's creation can command it. Those who know the hidden formula to craft these constructs guard the secret well and only a few shadowcasters deign to create these guardians on another person's behalf—for a hefty price.
**Recall Knowledge - Construct ([[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]])**: DC 32

<span class="in-box-ability">**Induction Word** Each shadowforged guardian is activated during creation by a special word or short phrase spoken by its creator, and hearing this induction word resets its functions. If the guardian hears a creature within 30 feet utter its induction word, the guardian must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] (stunned 3 on a critical failure). Regardless of the result of this save, it's immune to utterances of its induction word until the end of its next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Twilight Aura** (aura, illusion, occult, shadow) 30 feet. The shadowforged guardian's presence dims light and brightens shadows to a strange, twilit half-light. Light can't emanate brighter than dim light in this area while darkness is simultaneously illuminated to dim light. The shadowy aura automatically attempts to counteract any 5th-level or lower magical light or darkness effect brought into this aura or created in this area (counteract check +21, 5th level). As long as the guardian is in dim light, it gains a fly Speed of 30 feet.</span>

All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 29 Fortitude save. The guardian can't use Shadow Breath for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] until the end of its next turn.

###  Feral Guardians

Once created, a shadowforged guardian is entirely loyal to its creator, who must utter an induction word during the process of creation to secure their permanent control over the mindless construct.
