# Riekanoy

Riekanoys lurk in the placid rivers of the First World, demanding that travelers dance with them or face their wrath. Bitterly jealous of anyone that professes to be a better dancer, riekanoys make wagers in contests to prove who is the most graceful and sure-footed.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Beckoning Dance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual) The riekanoy sways in a compelling fashion. Each non-fey creature within a 300-foot emanation that can see the riekanoy must attempt a DC 38 Will save. The effect lasts for 1 round, but if the riekanoy uses Beckoning Dance again on subsequent rounds, the duration extends by 1 round for all affected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against Beckoning Dance, that creature is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
 **Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Failure** The creature is fascinated and must spend each of its actions to move closer to the riekanoy, avoiding obvious dangers. If a beckoned creature is adjacent to the riekanoy, it stays still and doesn't act. If attacked by the riekanoy, the creature is freed from captivation at the end of the riekanoy's turn.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but if attacked by the riekanoy, the creature can attempt a new save only at the start of its next turn, rather than being freed at the end of the riekanoy's turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Constrict|Constrict]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> 3d10+12 bludgeoning, DC 41</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Entangling Hair** A riekanoy can have up to eight creatures grabbed within their hair at a time.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Waving Hair** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The riekanoy attempts an Acrobatics check against each grabbed creature's Reflex DC.
