# Elemental Thicket

In the [[Material Plane]], plant growth proceeds on a scale of days, weeks, years, and decades. Conversely, an elemental thicket grows constantly and in seconds. These writhing masses of living wood are the elemental embodiment of growth itself, swelling up when least expected to consume all in their path.
