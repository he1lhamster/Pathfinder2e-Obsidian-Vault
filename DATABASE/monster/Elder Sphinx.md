<span class="in-box-ability">**Guardian Monolith** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The elder sphinx transforms their body into stone or back to flesh. In stone form, the sphinx is [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] but has Hardness 14 and gains immunity to bleed, [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy]], disease, [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]], negative damage, [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]], poison, [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]], and [[DATABASE/condition/Wounded|wounded]]. They don't age or require food, water, or sleep. They can perceive their surroundings and cast their innate spells. [[DATABASE/spell/Stone to Flesh|Stone to flesh]] turns the elder sphinx from stone form back to flesh, and [[DATABASE/spell/Flesh to Stone|flesh to stone]] turns it from flesh form to stone form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Idols of Stone** When the sphinx casts [[DATABASE/spell/Shape Stone|shape stone]], they can shape the stone into a magical duplicate of themself. When they cast [[DATABASE/spell/Clairaudience|clairaudience]], [[DATABASE/spell/Clairvoyance|clairvoyance]], [[DATABASE/spell/Locate|locate]], or [[DATABASE/spell/Ventriloquism|ventriloquism]], they can make the effect come from any duplicate, instead of themself. The elder sphinx can concentrate for 1 minute to transfer their consciousness to any duplicate; the sphinx is then in their stone form from Guardian Monolith in that statue. The sphinx can have no more than four duplicate statues at a time. Casting _shape stone_ at that point causes the oldest duplicate to crumble to dust.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Pose a Riddle** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (enchantment, incapacitation, linguistic, mental, occult) **Frequency** once per 10 minutes; The sphinx recites a riddle and compels up to 10 creatures within 30 feet to answer (DC 37 Will save). The GM either runs the riddle out of character by timing the players' attempts, or picks an appropriate associated skill for the riddle, such as [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] for a riddle involving divine mysteries. The sphinx gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls against any creature that answers incorrectly even once. This bonus lasts for 1 day. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected, but it can choose to try to help solve the riddle.. 
**Success** The creature attempts to answer the riddle. Each round spending at least one action attempting a [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check with the chosen skill (or working on the answer, if using an out of game riddle). This lasts for 1 minute, until the creature successfully answers the riddle, or until an enemy takes a hostile action against the creature, whichever comes first. 
**Failure** As success but the creature must spend at least two actions each round attempting to answer. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but up to 1 hour.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Pounce** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The elder sphinx Strides and makes a Strike at the end of that movement. If they began this action [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]], they remain hidden until after the attack.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Warding Glyph** Once per day, an elder sphinx can create a magical symbol as though casting a heightened [[DATABASE/spell/Glyph of Warding|glyph of warding]]. The sphinx usually shapes it to the form of a riddle and sets the password to the answer. A creature that doesn't speak the password must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be affected by one of the following spells, chosen by the sphinx when creating the symbol: [[DATABASE/spell/Visions of Danger|visions of danger]] (7th), [[DATABASE/spell/Spirit Blast|spirit blast]] (6th), [[DATABASE/spell/Synaptic Pulse|synaptic pulse]] (5th), charm (4th), fear (3rd), [[DATABASE/spell/Phantom Pain|phantom pain]] (3rd), or sleep (3rd). The sphinx learns the identity of any creature that answers the riddle and tends to be friendly to them</span>

###  Ancient Guardians

Elder sphinxes were revered as semi-divine by ancient cultures, hailed as wise prophets sent by the gods and trusted guardians of temple and necropolis alike, especially the burial sites of high kings and their dynastic heirs. Those in need of impartial rulings and divine inspiration make pilgrimage to ruins of ancient civilizations seeking the counsel of an elder sphinx.
