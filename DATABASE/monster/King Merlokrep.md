<span class="in-box-ability">**Rise from Death** (aura, divine, necromancy) If King Merlokrep is slain, the _Crown of the Kobold King_ glows brighter with an awful yellow radiance; this light slithers down inside the dead kobold's flesh, emanating from within as his body begins to twitch and writhe. If the Crown is allowed to remain on his head for 3 rounds, King Merlokrep rises from death as an undead Kobold King—this restores him to full hit points and grants him the Undead trait (along with [[Negative Healing]] and susceptibility to positive energy). Once the undead king is defeated, he remains destroyed—the absorbed energy of the Third Seal allows him to Rise from Death only once. If the Crown is removed before 3 rounds pass, the light winks out, and the energy absorbed by the Third Seal dissipates harmlessly.</span>
