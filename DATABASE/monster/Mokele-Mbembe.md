# Mokele-Mbembe

Mokele-mbembes are large, reptilian predators found deep within Golarion's jungles. Mwangi view mokele-mbembes as embodiments of nature's strength and majesty, and they consider the sighting of this rare being a sign of favor from the gods and an omen of powerful natural forces. Mokele-mbembes are solitary and excel at going undetected. Most information about them—including the fact that they're voracious predators—comes from following the signs of their passage.

###  Locations

Mokele-mbembes live in tropical jungles close to lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water. They take great care to hide themselves from civilization and other large predators, thus it can take many weeks or months of searching to locate even just their footprints. Travelers rarely encounter mokele-mbembes by accident, but those who do so (and live to tell about it) are considered very lucky indeed.
