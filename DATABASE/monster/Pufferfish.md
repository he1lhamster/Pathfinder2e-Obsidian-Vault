# Pufferfish

###  Peculiar Poison

Fast-acting and deadly, the pufferfish's venom is commonly used in assassinations due to its relative abundance and ease of harvesting. However, if you survive the poison's effective duration of 24 hours, recovery is quick and leaves no lingering symptoms. For this reason, the demand for pufferfish venom remains high among those who seek it to fake death.
