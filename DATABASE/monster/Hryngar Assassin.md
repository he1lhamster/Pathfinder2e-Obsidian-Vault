# Hryngar Assassin

In secret conclaves around Nar-Voth, hidden in plain sight within hryngar settlements, are the workshops and training grounds for the Darklands' most technologically sophisticated group of killers. Most hryngar assassins train from childhood, having been recruited from orphanages, and are under a life-debt obligation to their guild leader.
 While on contract, hryngar assassins are on the lookout for new technologies, gadgets, and alchemical creations. They bring what they find back to their guild to be reverse engineered and replicated for other guild assassins. When the opportunity presents itself, they destroy the schematics and formulae that other organizations, inventors, and alchemists have created if they can't steal them.

###  Bleeding Edge Killing Tech

Hryngar assassins use the most advanced gadgets and technology available to them. Their inventors are hard at work reverse engineering any specialized equipment they find so they can provide moderately equivalent designs to the best assassins. Elite assassins gain one consumable gadget of their level or lower, often selected for a specific job.
