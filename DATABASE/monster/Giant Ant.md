###  Ant Hives

Giant ants form vast underground colonies, excavating deep burrows or infesting existing caverns. Ants are omnivorous and cultivate fungus farms, but they are happy to eat whatever presents itself. Humanoids and their domesticated animals are easy fuel for the insectile machinery of their hives. Worker ants lack the sting of their warrior cousins, while elite drones fly on gossamer wings (fly Speed of 30 feet) to seek new food sources for their queen.
