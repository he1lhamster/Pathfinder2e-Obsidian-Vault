# Moon Hag

Moon hags are powerful soothsayers who dwell in places where souls receive their final judgment. These vile creatures possess knowledge of—and perhaps some power over—the portals between the lands of the living and the dead, and innocent mortals sometimes seek them out for this reason. Moon hags use their knowledge to sow discord and place seeds of doubt in those who unwittingly seek their aid. Beings of great power can intimidate them into sharing the truth of what they know, but the cunning hags always try to hide some important piece of information or word things in such a way that anyone acting on their divinations still find their plans falling into ruin.

###  Hag Harbingers

Moon hags serve the cosmic forces dedicated to the end of existence. On Golarion, they serve the god [[DATABASE/deity/Groetus|Groetus]], the great, skull-faced moon hanging over [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma's]] [[DATABASE/plane/Boneyard|Boneyard]]. Moon hags in the Boneyard are empowered by him as they were bathed in the light of the full moon
