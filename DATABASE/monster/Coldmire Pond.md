# Coldmire Pond

Coldmire ponds are often mistaken for shallow pools of water, but these sentient bodies of living water actually crawl along the ground or float through other liquids. Coldmires are dangerous ambush predators, drowning creatures that stray too close to or, even more hazardously, stand or swim inside their waters.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Shallow Waters** The coldmire pond can occupy the same space as other creatures. Creatures who move through the coldmire pond treat it as difficult terrain. Two creatures both occupying the coldmire pond's space are flanking it, regardless of their actual positions within the coldmire pond.</span>
