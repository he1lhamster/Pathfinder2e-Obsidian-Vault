# Scalescribe

Often seen at the sides of spellcasters, scalescribes are tiny, snakelike creatures with numerous hands that usually hold a multitude of fountain pens in various ink colors. The words scrawled across their bodies shift depending on what texts they've encountered recently. Scalescribes have a fondness for language, especially magical language, and make their homes in libraries or other places of learning.

**Mage Bond** After performing a 1-hour ritual, a scalescribe can bond with one willing creature capable of Casting Spells. The scalescribe can [[Aid]] their bonded caster in [[Crafting]] a scroll, and they can make their Transcribed spell available to the caster so long as the spell is of the caster's tradition. A bonded prepared caster can prepare the spell. A bonded spontaneous caster can add the spell to their spell repertoire during their daily preparations, and it remains as long as the Transcribed scroll exists.

The spell still affects the scalescribe, regardless of the results of this check. The scalescribe can Cast a Spell from any scroll they Transcribe as if it were on their spell list.

###  Scalescribe Assistants

Due to their scribing capabilities, scalescribes are highly sought after as assistants for [[Wizard]] and other scholarly spellcasters. Though rarely deigning to become true familiars, scalescribes keenly work with those they deem “clever,” as long as their friend helps them discover new words
