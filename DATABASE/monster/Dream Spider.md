# Dream Spider

A dream spider's webs have an iridescent hue and are infused with the same hallucinogenic compound as the creature's toxin. Originally denizens of tropical jungles, dream spiders have adapted well to temperate environments, particularly thriving among the rooftops of cities where shady alchemists use their venom to produce the drug known as [[DATABASE/equipment/Shiver|shiver]].

###  Shiver Addicts

Talented alchemists process dream spider venom into an addictive drug called [[DATABASE/equipment/Shiver|shiver]]. Those who become addicted to shiver may be driven in desperation to seek out dream spiders and allow them to bite their flesh in order to get their fix—a tactic that often backfires awfully as the spiders feed.
