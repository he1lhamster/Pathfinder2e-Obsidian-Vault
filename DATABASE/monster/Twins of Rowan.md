# Twins of Rowan

Twins of rowan are among the most powerful elementals on the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]], specially crafted to patrol a wide range of wilderness and maintain the plane's carefully constructed order. Despite having two heads and torsos, each twins of rowan is a singular creature; like all wood elementals, their true consciousness is not in their heads but in the roots, and their true body is the trunk of the tree, not the extended limbs.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Beacon of the Rowan Guard** (aura, plant, primal, wood) 40 feet. The lantern carried by the twins of rowan contains pure elemental life energy that resonates with and empowers all wood elementals. While within the emanation, a creature with the elemental trait and either the plant trait or wood trait gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing 10]] and a +2 circumstance bonus to all attack and damage rolls. The aura can be counteracted with a DC 30 check to [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]; doing so deactivates the aura for 1d6 rounds.</span>

###  Scions of Life

Rowan trees have a long association with protection; Shumunue accordingly chose rowan as the base for the powerful guardian twins. Their weapons and protective masks are grown separately from younger saplings fed with mineral-rich magic that makes their wood as strong and sharp as steel.
