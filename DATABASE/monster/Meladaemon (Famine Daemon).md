description: 'Megatheriums dwell deep within ancient forests and humid jungles. Fiercely
  territorial, these immense creatures are often smelt before seen. Though they travel
  on all fours, megatheriums can reach foliage 20 feet above the forest floor by standing
  on their hind legs and short, thick tails. Their enormous foreclaws, used to bend
  tree limbs within reach of their mouths, can cleave a horse in two and crush its
  rider.<br/><br/> The musk of the megatherium serves as a warning to potential predators
  and other megatheriums that they''re too close. Adult megatheriums are so territorial
  that most don''t reproduce more than twice in their lifetime. Though the creatures
  regularly patrol their territory for intruders, they tend to avoid settlements unless
  food has become scarce. When they do stray into towns, they''ve been known to devour
  entire orchards in a day.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Animal</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]]

# Meladaemon (Famine Daemon)

Meladaemons personify death by starvation and thirst, and revel in spreading the same despair that brought about their mortal demise. When they aren't blighting fields, massacring livestock, or tainting water supplies, they experiment on prisoners to study how long creatures can go without sustenance and the deleterious effects that result from such deprivation. Fiercely loyal to Trelmarixian, Horseman of Famine, they serve no other beings. They work alongside other daemons if Trelmarixian wills it, but are notoriously traitorous.

###  Formed in his Image

Meladaemons have always been gaunt and bestial, but they didn't always resemble jackals. When [[DATABASE/deity/Trelmarixian|Trelmarixian]] overthrew the previous Horseman of Famine, one of his first acts as a ruler of Abaddon was to forcibly twist the appearance of his deacon caste to resemble his own wicked form. He went on to imbue meladaemons with other jackal-like aspects as it suited him, further warping them and cementing their fealty.
