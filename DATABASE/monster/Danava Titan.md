# Danava Titan

Danava titans once regulated the foundational forces that shaped reality. Rebuked by the gods for being harsh and inflexible overseers, these spurned titans joined their siblings in their failed war against their creators. Defeated, the danavas were cast into the paralyzing depths of the cosmos's seas. The few danava titans who have escaped now wield the cold, darkness, and crushing pressure of their prisons in pursuit of their ancient visions of reality. Danavas split mountains, wake primordial beasts, or level whole civilizations in accordance with grand designs they forged at the dawn of time. Others hunt and harvest the balance-enforcing aeons, who they see as usurpers of their divine responsibility.

###  Danava Pillars

Some danavas, known as danava pillars, are custodians of a fundamental concept like life or knowledge—a crux of the universe. Destroying a danava pillar forcibly shreds their bonds and risks unraveling a portion of reality, with potentially disastrous effects.
