# Thunderbird

Thunderbirds bring storms on their wings. In times of drought, they are welcomed. Other times, they are offered gifts in hopes they might leave before flooding begins. When angered, they call down hurricanes and lay waste to entire villages, so many settlements conduct extensive rites to appease and honor local thunderbirds.
 Thunderbird parents carry their newly hatched offspring to hidden mountaintop nests, where the young are struck by their first bolts of lightning and learn the mysteries of the storm.

###  Thunder and Fire

Thunderbirds have a complex relationship with [[Phoenix]], whom they regard as too kindly and patient with human civilizations, even as they admire phoenixes' beauty and mastery over elements that thunderbirds cannot control. Often, encounters with phoenixes escalate into violent arguments, but it's rare for one of these meetings to end in a thunderbird's death, and even rarer for a phoenix to be significantly threatened by the upstart challenger.
