# Ancient Underworld Dragon

Underworld dragons embody the pressure between tectonic plates, the heat behind geysers, and flash fires that ignite when the conditions are just right. Natural alchemists, they innately understand reagents and catalysts. While some research the effects of magic on material reactions, the majority of underworld dragons concentrate on building their hoards. They scour the world for carved gemstones and artifacts of precious minerals, both of which they see as distilled essence of earth's bounty.
 Underworld dragons appear angular and sharp; their scales glow as if superheated from within, and their hair flickers like tongues of flames. An intense fire glows behind their gazes, suggesting they could ignite items with a mere thought, and their breath ripples the air as a testament to the heat contained within their bodies.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Countered by Water** If the underworld dragon takes damage from a spell with the cold or water trait, the elemental magic of fire within them is momentarily dampened.

This limitation ends if the dragon uses Breath Weapon.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Fed by Wood** When an underworld dragon is struck by a weapon made primarily of wood or affected by a spell with the plant trait, the dragon's internal fiery essences are stoked with the added fuel. Their breath weapon recharges, and the fire damage from the dragon's jaws increases by one die until the end of the dragon's next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Frightful Presence|Frightful Presence]]** (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 90 feet, DC 35</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Sweltering Heat** (arcane, aura, evocation, fire) 10 feet.
