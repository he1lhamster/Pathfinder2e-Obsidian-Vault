# Red Fox

The shy and perceptive red fox has uncanny adaptability and is just as comfortable in urban areas as in the wilds. Red foxes typically have rust-red fur, a white underbelly, and a characteristic white-tipped bushy tail. They are omnivorous, and eat insects, lizards, and small birds, pouncing on their prey to catch it. Because these opportunistic hunters see eggs and captive livestock as an easy meal, many farmers see them as foes.
