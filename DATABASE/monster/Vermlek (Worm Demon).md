# Vermlek (Worm Demon)

Vermleks, also called worm demons, manifest from the souls of mortals who desecrated the dead, such as grave robbers or necromancers. These fiends take their violations to a new extreme, using their demonic powers to horrifically core their living victims and don the flesh-husk that remains.
In its natural form, a vermlek resembles an oversized pinkish worm with four long tails that end in writhing fibrils. Its mouth splits into four segments like a profane tulip lined with rows of dozens of pointed teeth. More often than not, however, these fiends are encountered only after they have crawled into the body of a dead humanoid and made the hollowed-out flesh their temporary host. Vermleks use their powers of deception and disguise to infiltrate mortal settlements and influence unwitting acquaintances of the bodies they wear. Particularly intelligent or conniving vermleks might even reach stations of real power within the ranks of an army or government, at which point exposure of their true form can wreak havoc among the populace they have so thoroughly duped.

As long as it Inhabits a Body, the worm demon loses its bite attack, can wield weapons like a humanoid, gains a +3 circumstance bonus to AC, and gains a +3 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate the creature it is inhabiting.

On a critical failure, the creature is frightened 1 and [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]].

###  Telltale Desecration

Coroners and priests in demon-infested lands know immediately that they’re dealing with a vermlek when they’re brought a corpse that is little more than a sack of skin.
