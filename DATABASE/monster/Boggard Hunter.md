Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn't [[Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the boggard hunter's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue by hitting AC 22 and dealing at least 7 slashing damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.</span>
