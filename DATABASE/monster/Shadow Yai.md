# Shadow Yai

Oni who assume the form of [[Shadow Giant]] are known as shadow yais. Many shadow yais crave the pleasures of music and go to great lengths to secure bardic or musically inclined supplicants. Smaller beings who refuse to submit to a shadow yai are subject to painful, drawn out, and strangely beautiful deaths, for a shadow yai has a special way of evoking melodic cries and screams from their victims: a veritable symphony of pain. Individuals of particular musical skill who accompany a shadow yai can find the experience extremely lucrative and enriching—as long as they don't run afoul of their liege.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature takes 2d6 negative damage. 
**Failure** The creature becomes [[Drained]] and takes 3d6 negative damage. As long as the creature is drained as a result of this ability, it loses the ability to speak above a whisper. When the creature attempts to Cast a Spell with a verbal component, it must succeed at a flat check or the spell is disrupted. The DC of this flat check is equal to 5 plus the creature's drained value (for example, DC 7 if the creature is drained 2). 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature becomes drained 2 and takes 6d6 negative damage.</span>

###  Shadow Competitions

When shadow yais congregate they sometimes hold musical competitions between their servants. Wagers often include the performers themselves, so a servant might attend to many shadow yais over their life. Yais that feel cheated in these games redouble their recruitment in surrounding areas for an upper hand in the next contest.
