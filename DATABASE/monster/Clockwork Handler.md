# Clockwork Handler

One of the jobs most commonly outsourced to clockworks is guard duty. [[DATABASE/monster/Clockwork Soldier|Clockwork soldiers]] are often too costly to employ en masse, so municipalities looking to cut corners devised the much-cheaper clockwork handler, a budget-friendly construct sufficient for rat catching, door watching, and basic patrol work.
 Handlers are typically programmed to react efficiently to certain situations such as intruders or assailants. To that end, all handlers are equipped with an [[DATABASE/equipment/Everburning Torch|everburning torch]] fastened to their hooded lantern-like heads. Furthermore, most clockwork handlers used in public places have their fists covered in a padded material to ensure they don't accidentally beat suspects to death, though these modifications are removable (removing the nonlethal trait from their fist Strike). The nonlethal approach is considered the safest, as clockwork creatures don't always have the keenest judgement on who is a criminal and who is a customer. A healthy supply of rope allows the clockwork handler to quickly tie-up unruly vagabonds, that they might be brought to justice.

Creatures within 30 feet who fail a DC 14 Fortitude save can't hear anything but the siren, critically fail Perception checks that require hearing, and are immune to auditory effects. This effect lasts until the creature leaves the area and for 1 round afterward.</span>

###  Customized Handlers

Many organizations customize their clockwork handlers, giving them different equipment, unusual weapons, or just shiny paint jobs to openly display their affiliation with an organization. Shieldmarshalowned clockwork handlers have a navy-blue enamel finish with a painted-on badge, while handlers in service to the Church of [[DATABASE/deity/Brigh|Brigh]] typically sport a pearlescent white veneer and painted-gold detail work.
