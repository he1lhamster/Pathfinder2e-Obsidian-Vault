# Lampad Queen

Lampad queens are capricious monarchs and protectors of vast underground domains, regarded in ballads and tales as allies and foes, monsters and muses. Lampad queens have a particular animosity for the many predominantly evil underground ancestries, such as [[Drow]] and [[Duergar]], and they are particularly fond of bats. Many lampad queens have nykteras (page 254) as favored attendants.

**Cavern Empathy** The lampad queen can use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make an Impression]] on and make very simple [[Request]] of subterranean animals, plants, and fungi, as well as stones.
**Tied to the Land** A lampad queen is intrinsically tied to a specific underground region, usually a cave system. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the lampad queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals that would harm the environment, such as [[Blight]], with a +30 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 8. When the lampad queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, their warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the lampad queen swiftly heals the entire region.

The lampad queen can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to focus the emotions of a confused creature toward a particular emotion, causing it to spend its next turn sobbing uncontrollably, fawning over the lampad queen, or otherwise performing no actions beyond experiencing its emotions. Regardless of the save, the target is temporarily immune to Focus Beauty until the start of the lampad queen's next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Inspiration** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) for [[Maestro]], the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for [[Polymath]], the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.</span>

###  Reciprocity

Lampad queens tend to change emotions on a whim and mirror what they find in others. Those who treat the queen's domain with respect, they protect and reward, while those who harm it meet their swift wrath. This leads to the vastly differing accounts of the queens' actions.
