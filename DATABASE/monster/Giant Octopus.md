###  Giant Octopus Lairs

Giant octopuses favor shipwrecks, coral reefs, or underwater caverns as lairs, where they can take advantage of narrow confines for protection. Giant octopuses, like their smaller kin, are fond of adorning and decorating their lairs with found objects—many of which, in the giant octopus’s case, are also magical weapons, shields, or works of art salvaged from sunken ships or fallen adventurers.
