# Hill Giant

Selfish and crude, these rough-skinned raiders are bullies and ultimately cowards. Quick-tempered and fond of violence, a hill giant gladly raids and pillages the defenseless but is quick to flee from those who are bigger, stronger, or better organized than they are. A hill giant is never above shoving or tricking one of their own kind to slow down their opponent or get the best loot.
