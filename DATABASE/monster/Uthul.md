# Uthul

An uthul most often appears to be a dark, swirling cloud filled with flying debris and streaked with sudden flashes of lightning. Although they are clearly elemental in nature, uthuls are nearly always found on the Material Plane, where they hide among natural cloud formations, especially thunderstorms.

The bolt deals 6d12 electricity damage to all creatures in a 30-foot line, with a DC 34 basic Reflex save, and every creature in a 20-foot emanation must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save. The uthul can’t use Lightning Crash again for 1d4 rounds.

It stays in this form for 3 rounds or until it Dismisses the effect. While in this form, the uthul gains resistance 10 to physical damage and can move through other creatures. Its aura remains active, but it can’t make debris Strikes nor use Lightning Crash. Instead, any creature the uthul moves through takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d12 electricity damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. A Large or smaller creature must also succeed at a DC 32 Reflex save or be picked up and held suspended within the vortex. Suspended creatures move with the uthul. A creature can attempt to escape by spending an action to attempt a DC 32 Reflex save (or a DC 32 Acrobatics check to maneuver in flight if it has a fly Speed). Upon escaping, or when the uthul transforms back into its storm cloud form, a suspended creature is hurled 1d4 × 10 feet in a random direction, then falls unless it can fly or otherwise remain aloft. After returning to its normal form, the uthul must wait 1 minute before it can use Whirlwind Form again.</span>

###  Outcasts of Air

Uthuls are thought to be an outcast group of beings that once dwelled on the Plane of Air. It is unclear whether their fury was the reason for their expulsion from that plane or if they grew implacable after being banished. Uthuls do not speak of their history to anyone and simply redouble their unending rage on any who dare to ask.
