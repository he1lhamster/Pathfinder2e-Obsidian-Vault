<span class="in-box-ability">**Verdant Burst** (healing) When a gourd leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from its body, restoring 1d8 Hit Points to each plant creature in a 30-foot emanation. This area is filled with gourds, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment for these gourds, they wither after 24 hours.</span>
