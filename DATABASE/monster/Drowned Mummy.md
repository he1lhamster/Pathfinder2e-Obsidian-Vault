###  Environmental Adaptations

Mummies are resolute, refusing to abandon their tombs, burial sites, or lairs regardless of the changes wrought to these locations through the ages. Over the centuries, this stubbornness drives adaptation and innovation, resulting in mummies closely tied to their environments— no matter how weird!
