# Clockwork Brewer

With the rise of the automated workforce in Alkenstar came the “professional” line of clockworks, capable of carrying out more complex tasks and even interacting with the public. These clockworks were given modules inscribed with information and procedures for carrying out a specific profession. The clockwork brewer is one such example, capable of extracting wort, stirring a fermenter, or monitoring a boiling temperature. As many other types of clockwork professional exist as there are professions; clockworks have been programmed to reshelf library books, swab ship decks, and fill holes in heavily trafficked roads.
 Clockwork professionals made by reputable manufacturers are generally considered safe to interact with the public. Accidents have been known to occur, however, particularly when careless engineers fail to perform regular maintenance checks or when operators program a clockwork with insufficiently specific directives. Flesh and blood laborers forced to work in close proximity to a clockwork professional tend to keep a wide berth.

###  Beer and Ale

Beer, ale, and their many variants are the liquids most commonly contained inside the tanks of Alkenstar's clockwork brewers.
 The following type of beer was originally popular among factory workers in the industrial quarters of Alkenstar, though it can now be found in taverns throughout most of the Inner Sea region.
 **Smokeside Sour** (ingested, poison) **Saving Throw** DC 12 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 1 hour; **Stage 1** [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] (10 minutes); **Stage 2** clumsy 1 and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] (10 minutes); **Stage 3** clumsy 2, stupefied 2, and [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] (40 minutes)
