<span class="in-box-ability">**Coal Curse** (curse, primal, transmutation) Wounds dealt by Calcifda's claws stiffen flesh and turn the blood that runs from them into tar. Each time a creature is damaged by Calcifda's claw Strike, it must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or become permanently [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] (slowed 2 on a critical failure) as its flesh stiffens like stone. If a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points from Calcifda's claw Strike and fails the saving throw against coal curse, it's [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]] and turned to coal. A creature that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving throw to remove the effects of coal curse, even if it has been petrified.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Earth Glide** Calcifda can Burrow through any earthen matter, including rock. When she does so, she moves at her full burrow Speed, leaving no tunnels or signs of her passing.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Gem Gaze** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (emotion, fear, mental, primal) Calcifda holds aloft a gem and gazes into the mind of a creature within 30 feet, infusing the creature's thoughts with visions of their body slowly turning to coal. The creature must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]] (frightened 2 on a critical failure).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Lashing Stone** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** Calcifda makes a claw Strike that originates from any stony or tarry surface within 60 feet. A creature that fails its Fortitude save against coal curse from this Strike increases its [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] value by 1 (slowed 2 on a failed save, slowed 3 on a critical failure).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Steady Spellcasting** If a reaction would disrupt Calcifda's spellcasting action, she attempts a DC 15 flat check. On a success, the action isn't disrupted.</span>
