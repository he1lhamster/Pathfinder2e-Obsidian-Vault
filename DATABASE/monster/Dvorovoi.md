# Dvorovoi

Traditionally, the dvorovoi is seen as the domovoi's younger sibling and has charge of a peasant's yard and all the animals and tools within. Animals favored by the dvorovoi become healthy, strong, and obedient, while less-loved livestock are exhausted and miserable. Peasants with a resident dvorovoi make sure to formally introduce new livestock to the house spirit and placate the spirit by leaving meals in the shed. Dvorovoi loathe white-furred animals and chase away any all-white cows or horses, though they have no similar grudge against chickens.

**Master of the Yard** A yard with a friendly dvorovoi is blessed, as the dvorovoi helps in the yard, milks cows, protects tools, and does a hundred other small tasks. A yard so blessed never suffers from random accidents such as fires, and any checks to [[Craft]], [[Earn Income]], [[Repair]], or [[Subsist]] in the yard receive a +2 circumstance bonus. If the dvorovoi is unfriendly, such checks take a –2 circumstance penalty instead, as the domovoi causes trouble in the yard, scares cows, scatters tools, and otherwise makes life a misery. A dvorovoi must spend a week in a place before these benefits occur.
