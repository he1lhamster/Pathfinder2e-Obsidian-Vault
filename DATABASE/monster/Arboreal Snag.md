# Arboreal Snag

[[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Arboreal|Arboreals]] can be victims of undeath like any other living creature, but without bones or flesh, their undead take a different form. When an arboreal shivers to life as undead, it often animates as a snag—a leafless, skeletal dead tree that haunts its forest, attacking any living creature it can catch. An arboreal snag is mindless and difficult to control, but some necromancers use them as forest guardians.
 While many arboreals are comfortable remaining still for prolonged periods of time, arboreal snags tend to be restless, meandering in a region they consider their domain. This territory is sometimes evident from battered forest animals or trampled undergrowth that litters the ground, but forest creatures soon learn to avoid the area entirely. It doesn't take long for regions haunted by arboreal snags to grow desolate and unhealthy, and locals often dub such regions as haunted or cursed.

## Variant Arboreal Snags

Like skeletons and zombies, snags can demonstrate variant abilities. You can remove the arboreal snag's Putrid Sap to give it one of these other abilities instead.
 **Blood Roots** (necromancy, primal) The snag's roots go deep into corpses buried beneath and around it. It has [[DATABASE/monsterability/Regeneration|regeneration 5]] (deactivated by positive) as long as it remains in an area where corpses are buried.
 **Death Blossom** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (manipulate, necromancy, poison, primal) The snag shakes branches covered in sickly flowers, showering all creatures within reach of its branch Strike with poisonous pollen, dealing 3d6 poison damage (DC 20 basic Fortitude save). If the snag is critically hit, it can use Death Blossom as a reaction.
**Recall Knowledge - Undead ([[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]])**: DC 20
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 18
**Specific Lore**: DC 15

###  Undead Trees

Rumors persist of evil primal spellcasters who summon undead arboreals for malevolent purposes. These summoned creatures might be arboreal snags at low levels or [[DATABASE/monster/Arboreal Tar Tree|arboreal tar trees]] at higher levels.
