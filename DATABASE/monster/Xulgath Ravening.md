# Xulgath Ravening

Strength and hunger drive most xulgath societies, reinforced by the tenets of their abyssal patron Zevgavizeb. A powerful leader can seize control of a xulgath community and direct their followers to fight as a unit, but formation fighting isn't something most xulgaths practice. This mob mentality often results in overzealous warriors tripping over or even biting each other. Suitably, these mobs have earned the name “ravenings,” a term also used when describing Zevgavizeb's carnivorous rampages and referring to the millennia of xulgath infighting and social decline.

###  The Power of Suggestion

Xulgath ravening are most common in clutches controlled by spiritual leaders using some combination of cult behavior, group ritual, and even a little enchantment magic. By convincing participants that they're possessed by Zevgavizeb or a similar force, the leader then identifies a target and hopes for the best. Instilling secular doubt or incapacitating the leader can shatter a ravening's focus, causing its members to scatter or even turn on their leader.
