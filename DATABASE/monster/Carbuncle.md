# Carbuncle

Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than that of the lowly carbuncle. At first glance, carbuncles appear to be little more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart is their strange magical abilities and the gemstone-like horn protruding from between their goggling eyes. Although rumors suggest various uses for carbuncle horns, ranging from miracle cure-alls to potent magical components, the truth is much more mundane: a carbuncle's horn is merely a highly reflective growth, not unlike a fingernail.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Easy to Influence** Any mental spell can affect a carbuncle, regardless of creature type limitations.

The real carbuncle transports to a clear space within 30 feet that it can see, and a hollow shell remains behind. The fake body appears solid until it is touched, at which point it crumbles to dust.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Specious Suggestion** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (enchantment, incapacitation, mental) **Frequency **three times per day; **Effect **The carbuncle concentrates on a creature it can see and tries to manipulate that creature. The target must attempt a DC 18 Will save. The target then becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours. 
**Critical Success **The attempt backfires and bolsters the target's mind instead, granting it a +1 status bonus to Will saving throws for 1 hour. 
**Success **The target briefly experiences an unusual but harmless sensation like an unexpected flavor or scent, an urge to eat something strange, or an amusing half-forgotten memory. 
**Failure **The target is compelled to spend all of its actions on its next turn performing harmless, pointless, and usually embarrassing actions. 
**Critical Failure **As failure, but the compulsion persists for 1 minute. The target can attempt a new save at the end of its turn each round to end the effect.</span>

###  Carbuncle Chatter

“A lizard with an apple-sized gem sticking out of its forehead? Wishful thinking!”
 “Carbuncles are real! I almost caught one, but even though it could barely walk, its magic allowed it to escape my clutches.”
 “Their mind control powers could make them useful familiars, but if you ever catch one, it dies of fright.”
 “My advice is to stay away from these pests. They drink your hopes and aspirations through their horns, leaving you empty except for bad luck and bellyaches.”
 “Planning a carbuncle hunt? You'd better leave your self-respect at home, and be ready to emerge with fewer friends than you had at the start!”
