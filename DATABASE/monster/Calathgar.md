# Calathgar

Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A calathgar's blue flowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.
Calathgars' psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly flawless memories and can share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on information by speech. While calathgars themselves can't speak, they can typically be reasoned with—though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Cold Healing** Calathgars are healed by cold. Anytime a calathgar would take cold damage, it instead regains 1d6 Hit Points (regardless of the amount of damage the cold effect would have caused). In severe cold or colder environments, calathgars gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing 1]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Mold Mulch** When a calathgar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it immediately decays and dies, transforming into a 5-foot patch of mold (or a 10-foot patch of mold if it was killed by fire damage). This patch of mold persists for 1 minute, during which time it deals 3d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its turn in this area, or 1d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its turn in an adjacent square. The mold patch decays away after an hour, but it can be destroyed before then (treat each 5-foot square as an object with Hardness 0, 10 Hit Points, BT 5, immunity to cold, piercing, and slashing damage; the mold deals half its regular cold damage once it's broken).</span>

###  Vengeful Flowers

Calathgar cuttings are greatly desired in warmer lands, yet horticulturalists often fail to realize that calathgars are sapient, mobile, and vengeful against those who prune their leaves or take cuttings. These feral flowers understand the speech of forest denizens and often shift and move their groves when they sense danger approaching. They protect their immature and immobile offspring, and if they discover a garden of their young has been despoiled, they track down the perpetrators to unleash a flurry of vengeance upon them.
