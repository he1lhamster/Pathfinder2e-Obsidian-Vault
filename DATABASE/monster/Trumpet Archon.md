# Trumpet Archon

Trumpet archons are messengers, emissaries, and storytellers—embodiments of the virtue of kindness. They use stories and allegories to prevent bloodshed, and among all archons they are the most likely to work together with angels, perhaps leading to the similarities in their forms. When diplomacy is impossible, trumpet archons rally the righteous to battle—one reassuring glance from a trumpet archon is often all it takes to instill a shaken ally with resounding courage once again.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Archon's Door** Once per day, if an archon sees another creature cast [[Dimension Door]], the archon can use dimension door (heightened to 5th level) within 1 round to attempt to follow that creature to the maximum distance of the archon's dimension door. If the archon's dimension door has enough distance, the archon appears the same distance and direction from the creature as before either creature used dimension door.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Kind Word** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment, linguistic, mental) The trumpet archon offers an ally praise or encouragement.

Non-archons within 100 feet must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save. They are temporarily immune for 10 minutes. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature is [[Flat-Footed]]. 
**Failure** The creature is [[Stunned]] and flat-footed as long as it's stunned. 
**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round.</span>

###  Instruments of War

A trumpet archon's magical instrument is no mere piece of brass; each of these immaculately crafted horns is said to be crafted in Heaven's blessed forges and infused with the voices of a thousand angels. Only archons can truly play such trumpets—mortals lack the power necessary to create trumpet archons' iconic clarion calls, but can still play them as virtuoso instruments.
