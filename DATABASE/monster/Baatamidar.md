# Baatamidar

Baatamidars are drawn to destroy planar communities on the fringes where the Outer Planes touch the chaos of the [[Maelstrom]]. They resemble floating blobs of undulating, prismatic ooze with four quivering tentacles and dribbles of oily slime that always drip upwards.
**Recall Knowledge - Monitor ([[Religion]])**: DC 47
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 45
**Specific Lore**: DC 42

<span class="in-box-ability">**Unrelativity Field** (arcane, aura, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) 1 mile. Creatures who start their turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 48 Will save or become unable to understand any communication (including [[Telepathy]]), distinguish social rank or authority, or differentiate the relative value of objects or services. This persists for as long as the creature is in the aura. Creatures who succeed at the save are temporarily immune for 1 hour (24 hours on a critical success). Proteans are immune to the unrelativity field. The baatamidar can suppress this aura or activate it again as a free action.</span>

Each attack counts separately for the baatamidar's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until the baatamidar has made all the attacks. If the baatamidar subsequently uses the [[Improved Grab]] action, it can [[Grab]] any number of creatures it hit with Writhing Arms.</span>

###  Making Allies of Enemies

Baatamidar represent a tangible and imminent crisis to planar communities. When a baatamidar drifts into a region, locating and defeating it becomes a top priority for leaders of any alignment. Thus, celestial and infernal commanders alike make defeating baatamidars a priority, sometimes even joining together to exterminate the common threat.
