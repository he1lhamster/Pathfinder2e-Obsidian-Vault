# Baatamidar

Baatamidars are drawn to destroy planar communities on the fringes where the Outer Planes touch the chaos of the [[DATABASE/plane/Maelstrom|Maelstrom]]. They resemble floating blobs of undulating, prismatic ooze with four quivering tentacles and dribbles of oily slime that always drip upwards.
**Recall Knowledge - Monitor ([[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]])**: DC 47
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 45
**Specific Lore**: DC 42

###  Making Allies of Enemies

Baatamidar represent a tangible and imminent crisis to planar communities. When a baatamidar drifts into a region, locating and defeating it becomes a top priority for leaders of any alignment. Thus, celestial and infernal commanders alike make defeating baatamidars a priority, sometimes even joining together to exterminate the common threat.
