**Site Bound** A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location.

**HP** 175 ([[DATABASE/monsterability/Negative Healing|negative healing]], rejuvenation); **Immunities** death effects, disease, [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], poison, precision, [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]]; **Resistances** all damage 10 (except force, [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]], or positive; double resistance vs. non-magical)
<span class="in-box-ability">**Rejuvenation** (divine, necromancy) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting. Burying Kannitri's remains in the courtyard or carving her name into the pagoda sculpture there (area A3) permanently puts her spirit to rest.</span>

It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit.

If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.</span>
