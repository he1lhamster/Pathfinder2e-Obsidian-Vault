# Baobhan Sith

Undeath is rare in the fey realm of the First World, for that plane's infusion with the raw power of life makes undead uncomfortable at best. Yet a few fey have adopted the vile practices and habits of notorious undead while still being living themselves, as seen in the blood-drinking habits of the murderous baobhan sith.
A baobhan sith avoids confrontations when outnumbered, and although territorial, they won't reveal their true nature to larger groups. They prefer to drink blood from victims they find attractive, and they avoid drinking blood from animals and beasts entirely, as they consider such activities to be uncultured.

###  Haunting Lairs

A baobhan sith adores the aesthetics of abandoned homes, desolate burial grounds, and crumbling ruins. They strive to give their lairs a gothic beauty rather than allowing them to get run down and filthy.
