# Xotanispawn

Xotanispawn are monstrous versions of scavenging beetle larvae that have been corrupted and mutated by feeding on the remains of Xotani the Firebleeder, a slain Spawn of Rovagug buried beneath Pale Mountain in Katapesh. These creatures look vaguely like the minute insects they once were, with a sclerotized head and chitinous body plates, six legs, and numerous dorsal spines lining the joints and edges of each segment. However, by feeding on the unholy remains of Xotani, the spawn have manifested many of the traits of the infamous Firebleeder, most notably a blisteringly hot internal temperature and powerful fire attacks—to say nothing of their monstrous size.
 Internal heat radiates from every surface of a Xotanispawn, even from its mouth. Any contact with a Xotanispawn results in burns and the risk of catching on fire. Thankfully, Xotanispawn have also inherited Xotani’s weaknesses to cold and sunlight. They are rarely encountered on the surface during the day, opting to emerge from their subterranean lairs only at night.

###  The Firebleeder's Mark

Terrible rumors speak of other monsters that have emerged from the Firebleeder’s corpse in the centuries since the Legion of Wands put the beast to rest. Reports of massive clouds of noxious black sand, gray-blooded gnoll zombies with spider-like limbs, and guttural, otherworldly howls during harvest moons have long fueled local rumors that more terrors lurk in the valleys of the Brazen Peaks than a single dead god-spawn.
