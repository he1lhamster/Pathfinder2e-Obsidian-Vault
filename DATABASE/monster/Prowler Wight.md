# Prowler Wight

Often found lurking in the dark, prowler wights wield subterfuge as their greatest weapon. They frequently feign death in old sewers, graveyards, and mausoleums, waiting for hapless victims to pass by before striking.

They have an automatic result of 38 on [[Deception]] checks and DCs to pass as an ordinary corpse.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Sneak Attack]]** The prowler wight deals an additional 2d6 precision damage to [[Flat-Footed]] creatures.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spawn Prowler Wight** (divine, necromancy) A living humanoid killed by a prowler wight's weapon or claw Strike rises as a prowler wight spawn after 1d4 rounds. This spawn is under the command of the prowler wight that killed them. They don't have drain life or spawn prowler wight and are [[Clumsy]] for as long as they're a prowler wight spawn. If the creator of the prowler wight spawn dies, the prowler wight spawn becomes a fully autonomous prowler wight; they regain their free will, gain drain life and spawn prowler wight, and are no longer clumsy.</span>
