# Vetalarana Emergent

A vetalarana emergent is inexperienced and ravenous, often caring more for the consumption of thoughts than the quality of the thoughts and memories consumed. These undead gluttons gorge themselves on memories, leaving a crowd of addled and terrified victims in their wake.
 Experienced emergents are cannier than their newly risen kin, stalking their chosen victims and being sure to abduct, kill, or render their victims comatose after draining their memories to ensure no witnesses remain to reveal the presence of a vetalarana.
