# Soul Eater

Only the most desperate or foolhardy conjurers call upon the aid of these strange fiends from the inky swamps of [[DATABASE/plane/Abaddon|Abaddon]].
**Recall Knowledge - Fiend ([[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]])**: DC 25
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 23
**Specific Lore**: DC 20

**Caster Link** (detection, divine, divination) A conjured soul eater forms a mental link with its conjurer. While both are on the same plane, the soul eater knows the location of its conjurer per its find target ability. If the soul eater's target dies before the soul eater can drain its soul, or if the soul eater is defeated (but not destroyed) by the target, the soul eater returns to its conjurer and tries to kill them.
**Find Target** (detection, divine, divination) When a soul eater is conjured to the Material Plane to find a specific creature, it gains the benefits of a 5th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Locate|locate]] spell that isn't blocked by lead or running water. The conjurer must have seen the target and must speak the target's name while conjuring the soul eater in order to grant this ability.

The creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save. A creature that dies as a result of Drain Soul can't be restored to life except by a spell or ritual of 8th level or higher. If the soul eater that used Drain Soul on a creature is slain within 100 feet of that creature's corpse and the creature has been dead no longer than 1 minute, the creature's soul returns to its body and is restored to life, leaving the creature [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] and dying 1 but no longer [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]]. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

Further damage dealt by the soul eater increases the stupefied value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of stupefied 4. This condition value decreases by 1 each time the creature gets a full night's rest. As long as the creature is stupefied by a soul eater, rest does not decrease any [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]] value that creature might have.</span>

###  Soul Gluttons

As if soul eaters weren't frightening enough, there exists on [[DATABASE/plane/Abaddon|Abaddon]] much larger variants of these monsters, known as soul gluttons. Appearing as roiling, inky black clouds and possessing a half dozen arms, soul gluttons are much deadlier than their smaller kin and are also much more dangerous to conjure, as they have a disturbing knack for wriggling out of a conjurer's control.
