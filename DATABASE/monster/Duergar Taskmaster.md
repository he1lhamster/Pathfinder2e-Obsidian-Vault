# Duergar Taskmaster

Duergar priests of the taskmaster god Droskar often assume leadership roles within their communities, advancing the goals of their deity through coercion and displays of force. Often referred to as duergar taskmasters, these leaders often issue commands to duergar subordinates and slaves in the same breath, treating the two almost as if they were interchangeable. As a result, duergar taskmasters are loathed by both slave and slaver alike.
