# Tapir, Giant

With a blunt, prehensile trunk and a squat posture, giant tapirs resemble a cross between elephant and boar, though they're actually more closely related to horses and rhinoceroses. Tapirs live in loose herds that graze near rivers and lakes. They enjoy fresh water, not only for the lush plants that grow along the shores—which they eat in prodigious quantities— but also for the protection the water provides. When predators approach, tapirs retreat to the water to hide, keeping their snouts barely above the surface to breathe. Likewise, the breezes and scents that accompany creeks and rivers mask tapirs' musk as they travel along these waterways. Despite their ungainly movement, tapirs are remarkably sure-footed, easily traversing mud and similar terrain thanks to their broad toes.
 Humanoids often hunt giant tapirs for their meat and durable hides. Such hunts are far from guaranteed, though; tapirs can run at least as fast as their hunters, and most will fight if cornered. The docile giants do what they can to avoid confrontation whenever possible. If they sense danger approaching, giant tapirs make a loud whistling sound to warn other tapirs about predators. A community who befriends or domesticates a herd of tapirs can use this whistling habit as an alarm system against encroaching enemies.
 Giant tapirs are usually quite placid, but they can be fearsome when roused.

###  Tapir Mounts

Like horses, to which they're distantly related, giant tapirs make serviceable mounts. Few giant tapirs have the temperament to serve as war-steeds, even with years of training, and they aren't as fast as horses. Thus, most giant tapirs are suitable only for casual travel or carrying luggage. Giant tapirs eagerly charge into or across water, which can take an unready rider by surprise. 
Tapirs trained as mounts gain the [[Buck]] reaction (DC 16).
