# Agradaemon (Conflagration Daemon)

Equal parts lion, spider, and demagogue, agradaemons are born from the forge-flames of [[DATABASE/deity/Szuriel|Szuriel]], Horseman of War. Although they're unwilling to work alongside each other for long, agradaemons frequently establish themselves as leaders of cults whose goal is to burn civilization to the ground. To these scheming monsters of flame and fear, torching a city is a mere diversion; incinerating a nation's entire agricultural system to turn its citizens into starving marauders before setting their forests and plains ablaze is truly satisfying.

###  Soul Fuel

Whatever heat lay beneath the wastes of [[DATABASE/plane/Abaddon|Abaddon]] bled away eons ago. Thereafter, the smiths forging weapons for [[DATABASE/deity/Szuriel|Szuriel]], Horseman of War, turned to mortal souls as fuel for their fires. The flames of these unholy forges can generate profane creatures, and agradaemons are among the worst of these.
