# Muckish Creep

Legends say that the first muckish creeps were born at the site of a mass grave where the souls of murdered prisoners coalesced into the surrounding soil. Another myth tells that muckish creeps were elementals so vile that their kin banished them from the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]]. Regardless of their true origins, muckish creeps are wicked creatures that resemble mud given a humanoid shape. The mud is no ordinary mixture of earth and water, however, for muckish creeps feed on the blood of the living, and they use this blood to keep their own forms moist and malleable.
 Muckish creeps are particularly tenacious and single-minded when it comes to choosing prey. Once a muckish creep selects its next victim, there is little one can do to stop it, since it can seep through even the smallest cracks between doors, walls, and windows. A muckish creep typically waits until its target falls asleep before pressing itself into the creature's home, intent to kill. For all its tenacity during the hunt, the muckish creep is pragmatic when it comes to the actual kill, using its body to fill the victim's airways with mud and suffocate them.

###  Cursed Mud

When a muckish creep's bloody mud is used as mortar in building construction, it sometimes creates a new muckish creep fused with the structure. Such a creature can move the entire building as if it were part of its own body. In the jungles and rainforests where muckish creeps are common, people often call upon clerics to bless their building materials, including the mud, in order to avoid unintentionally creating such a being.
