# Peng

Pengs are massive avian beasts who fly effortlessly among the highest clouds. Their bright plumage makes it difficult to see their shape against an azure sky, but with patience, an onlooker might notice movement too swift to be a natural cloud.
 Beautiful and graceful, pengs arise from the unlikeliest of origins: the cruel [[DATABASE/monster/Kun|kun]], a hateful fish monster whose predilection for the crushing depths of the sea matches the peng's own love of the bright, open sky. After a kun sacrifices their power for a noble heart by bathing in the sun's rays, they transform into this majestic bird, which eschews violence unless they must fight to stay free. Pengs do not seek danger or thrills; they want only to make their long voyages and fly without disruption.
 A peng's calm and steady nature is so strong that its mere presence can quell storms and still winds. Mariners and pilots believe spotting a peng is a sign of good luck. When the sky is clear and blue and the weather gentle for an extended period, people attribute such fine conditions to the presence of an unseen peng.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Calm Weather Aura** (air, aura, evocation, primal) 1 mile. The ambient weather around a peng is always lightly cloudy with a pleasant breeze, and the temperature is pleasantly warm for the season. A creature that attempts to alter the weather within this aura (such as with a [[DATABASE/ritual/Control Weather|control weather]] ritual or localized effect like [[DATABASE/spell/Gust of Wind|gust of wind]]) must succeed at a DC 33 Will save; otherwise the effect is disrupted. The peng can activate or deactivate this aura as a single action (this action has the concentrate trait).</span>

###  Clear Direction

Most pengs on Golarion are seen in the skies of southern Tian Xia. Pengs hardly ever roost or even stop to rest, and they are almost always seen headed in a southerly trajectory. According to pengs themselves, they have no destination: they are headed south, and even they don't know why. Some whimsical pengs claim that they are in pursuit of a dream they once had in a life they lived long before this one.
