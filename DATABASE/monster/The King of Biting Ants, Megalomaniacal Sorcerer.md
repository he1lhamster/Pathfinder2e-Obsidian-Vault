# The King of Biting Ants, Megalomaniacal Sorcerer

Among the many evil forces that Old-Mage Jatembe faced to bring the world back into light, perhaps none was as insidious as the sorcerer known as the King of Biting Ants. This villain's original name is long lost; indeed, the wicked sorcerer claims it was the first thing he consumed when he transformed within a strange ruin deep in the Mwangi Expanse known today as the Cathedral of Nothingness. The King of Biting Ants sought to grasp power within the ruin, only to become corrupted in mind and transformed in body into a swarm of ants held together only by his prodigious will. In his time with a nihilistic cult, he learned the secret of the nearby Doorway to the Red Star—that it was a gateway to the distant planet of Akiton established by the hyper-intelligent but erratic creatures of that world called the [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Contemplative of Ashok|Contemplatives of Ashok]]—but he wasn't interested in that distant world. Instead, he used the doorway's magic to grant his armies of red-cloaked acolytes immortality and set about conquering the Mwangi Expanse.
 Jatembe would not let this evil stand. He traveled to the doorway and fought with the King of Biting Ants, scattering his form and driving him through the doorway along with his ageless acolytes. The King of Biting Ants was banished and his evil quelled—or so Jatembe thought.
 A few centuries ago, Jatembe learned that the King of Biting Ants was able to eventually restore some of his power on Akiton and had developed a flying airship bearing a devastating superweapon. Jatembe traveled to Akiton to confront his old foe, but he knew that another victory in combat would be as temporary as his previous one. Instead, he let the King of Biting Ants appear to defeat him, trusting that his foe's arrogance would blind him to Jatembe's plan. Sure enough, the King of Biting Ants captured Jatembe and imprisoned him aboard his fortress-airship, the _Mandibles of Fate_. Jatembe only pretends to be a prisoner; he makes regular trips across the planes, as he did before being captured, and leaves a magical duplicate in his cell when he does. Still, he spends much of his time aboard the _Mandibles of Fate_, infusing its half-living superstructure with his bodiless spirit. Meanwhile, the King of Biting Ants has greater plans for his superweapon: use it to destroy Jatembe's legacy while making the wizard witness the carnage firsthand.
 The superweapon the King of Biting Ants worked so hard to create, the _soulshredder cannon_, is indeed terrifying; it can pull souls from the living and compress them together into formidable (and loyal) [[DATABASE/monster/Nemhaith|nemhaiths]]. But the insectile sorcerer has greater plans; he wants to expand the power of his superweapon to destroy entire communities, starting with the Magaambya on Golarion. Jatembe has secretly stymied this latest goal, but the King of Biting Ants has proven too tenacious at pursuing his plan of revenge. Indeed, he's finally succeeded in mastering the community-shattering power of his ship-mounted _soulshredder cannons_, and he's just a few test-fires away from returning to Golarion with the _Mandibles of Fate_ and a wicked plan for revenge.

## Campaign Role

The King of Biting Ants is the heroes' final foe in this adventure. With Jatembe's assistance and their own skills, the heroes have the opportunity to stop the King's current plans and put an end to the wicked sorcerer at last. His psyche survives, in part, within the _Vesicant Egg_ at the Magaambya, but ending his efforts on Akiton saves countless lives.
