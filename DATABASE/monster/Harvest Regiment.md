# Harvest Regiment

Great fruiting trees grow in massive orderly rows in a region of the [[Plane of Wood]] called Armory Grove. Over the course of decades, a regiment tree's branches grow heavy, laden with fruits uncannily shaped like people. They're cultivated by retired warriors whose tireless work ensures that these fruits grow into a form suitable for battle. Their efforts instill tactical knowledge in these fruit warriors so they're prepared to fight as soon as they fall from the tree—which they do simultaneously, forming one battle-ready unit. Each soldier is equal in skill and similar in form, with a wooden outer shell that splits into portions as the flesh of the fruit inside ripens. A slain warrior contains seeds within its body that can slowly germinate in rich soil with enough water—or blood. Every battlefield can become a new garden.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Juice Shower** When a harvest regiment is critically hit or critically fails a save against a damaging effect, sticky fruit juices splash out. This affects all creatures in a 5-foot emanation. A splashed creature takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds and everything is [[Concealed]] to it. A creature can Interact to clear off the juice.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Troop Defenses]]** </span>

###  Out of Season

The harvest regiment stat block represents the troop when it's harvested at exactly the right time. A “green,” or unripe, regiment might be pressed into service before it's ready, and an overripe version could fall off the tree partially rotten. Both of these use the weak adjustments and have 126 HP with thresholds of 84 and 42 HP. A green regiment loses juice shower and weakness to fire, and a rotten regiment's juice shower makes the creature [[Sickened]] if it fails a DC 25 Fortitude save instead of the normal effect.
