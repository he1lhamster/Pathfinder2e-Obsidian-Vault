# Elasmosaurus

Elasmosauruses are long-necked, primeval reptiles that dwell in deep oceans and seas. Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.
As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with near-humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it's theorized that a typical water orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.
While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions, those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds to specific regions. As a result, it's not unheard of for a wandering specimen to find its way to coastal waters. Those that do often find the ports of small towns or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward elasmosaurus like this finds its way into a city's sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become the stuff of urban legends.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Long Neck** An elasmosaurus's long neck allows it to interact with the surface while its body remains submerged underwater. While submerged no deeper than 15 feet underwater, an elasmosaurus can still stick its head up to breathe. An elasmosaurus gains cover against attacks made against creatures who are above the water's surface while it is underwater, even if its head is above the surface.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** Jaws only.</span>

###  Other Aquatic Reptiles

The elasmosaurus is but one of many types of aquatic reptiles found in primeval oceans or lost worlds. Some, like the ichthyosaurus, are almost fishlike in appearance. Others, such as the mosasaurus, are truly massive beasts capable of killing and eating whales.
