# Daelum

During the height of the legendary war between Nex and Geb, Nex's agents grew increasingly creative in their “recruiting” methods for their armies. One such effort involved the construction of mechanical soldiers powered by arcane engines but directed by transplanted minds. While the process generally involved willing donors who were eager to give up dying bodies to “live on” in constructed frames, rumors persist that Nex harvested the minds of prisoners of war and criminals for these creations.
 Today, thousands of years after those wars ended, hundreds of daelums still live. Their intellects have, in large part, fully embraced their new “lives,” and very few remember their previous existences today. Daelums can be found throughout the Mana Wastes serving as guides, porters, mine workers, and mercenaries.

While in this form, their Speed increases by 10 feet and they don't count the contents of their belly hatch against the total amount they can carry. The daelum can make hoof Strikes in quadruped form, but not pick or claw Strikes.

The cloud persists for 3 rounds, but doesn't move with the daelum. All creatures within the cloud are [[Concealed]]. A creature that begins its turn in the smog cloud must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save (creatures that must breathe and don't hold their breath take a –2 circumstance penalty on their save). 
**Critical Success** No effect and temporarily immune for 1 hour. 
**Success** The creature is [[Sickened]]. 
**Failure** The creature is sickened 2. 
**Critical Failure** The creature is sickened 2 and [[Slowed]].</span>

###  Daelum Claims

Officials in Alkenstar regularly refuse to recognize claims purchased by daelums and have been known to hand down heavy penalties even if the claim was otherwise legally purchased. It's not surprising then, that daelum cohorts prefer to operate far from Alkenstar or, barring that, to ally with gangs of mutants or outlaws hoping to eke valuable metals from the ground.
