# Fuath

Despite their small size, fuaths are shipwreckers incarnate. In the dark of night, these gremlins sever ratlines, slash sails, smash sextants, and soil provisions. Once the ship founders, the fuaths return to indulge their craving for land-raised flesh. While fuaths prefer to take their prey asleep, they save a terrible doom for sailors who attack them, surrounding the mariners' faces in magically congealed water to drown them where they stand.
 Constantly dripping with water, fuaths have seahorse-like faces, seaweed-green fur over yellow skin, and wicked lobster claws for hands. Lacking the Undercommon tongue, they have trouble relating to other gremlins aside from [[DATABASE/monster/Haniver|hanivers]], but revere [[DATABASE/monster/Sea Hag|sea hags]] and evil aquatic fey.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Viscous Choke** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (conjuration, primal, water) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The fuath surrounds the head of one air-breathing creature within 30 feet in a magical film of viscous water for 1 minute. The target must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or begin to choke and must hold their breath to avoid drowning. The film can be temporarily wiped away with a total of 3 Interact actions by the choking creature or creatures adjacent to it, allowing a new Reflex save with a +2 circumstance bonus to end the effect. (These actions don't need to be consecutive or made by the same creature.)</span>

###  Fuath Guardians

Lone fuaths sometimes appoint themselves guardians of nature, protecting spawning grounds from overfishing or preventing careless cutting of peat bogs. Most, however, are unrepentant saboteurs.
