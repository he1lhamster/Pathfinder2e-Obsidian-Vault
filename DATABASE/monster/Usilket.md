# Ulsiket, Friendly Pactmaster Agent

An elite representative of the Pactmasters of Katapesh, Usilket is a child of Pactmaster Krimiltuk. Usilket expressed a genderfluid identity long before their training as an agent of the Katapeshi [[Witchwyrd]] consortium began. They took their current name, with its feminine and masculine connotations, at the onset of their education. Their elastic identity proved to be an asset for developing expertise in empathy, impersonation, and understanding, especially in social circles outside Katapesh's witchwyrd culture. Instruction honed these talents, supplementing them with impressive unarmed skills. Usilket has become an ideal diplomat, speaker, spy, trader and, when needed, warrior.
 In Katapeshi society, Usilket holds great authority. Their filial position is the equivalent of a high-ranking aristocrat, but following tradition, Usilket sought opportunities to distinguish themself and improve their position. Usilket serves the government of Katapesh. However, they've also set up successful trade relationships involving exploration, diplomacy, and acquiring goods from unusual sources. Establishing relations with Uomotos and a foothold in Kho was, as fate has it, Usilket's idea.
 The Pactmasters agreed and gave Usilket dispensation to visit the Uomoto people and Kho to establish relations and assess threats and potential value. Soon thereafter, the Scattering occurred, and while a few cards ended up in the possession of the Pactmasters (including [[The Owl]], which appeared amid Usilket's belongings), even more manifested in Kho. The Pactmasters were immediately interested in finding out more about the cards, but when their research drew the attention of [[The Prince Of Wolves, Abyssal Crime Lord]], they decided to pause until this new threat could be assessed and dealt with.

## Campaign Role

Usilket works as a facilitator. Although they might seem generous, all Usilket does is to fulfill the Pactmasters' goals of thwarting the Unmatched with as little risk to their consortium as possible. While Usilket isn't quite as powerful as the PCs, (particularly toward the end of this adventure), they can be used as an agent to facilitate a desperate rescue—particularly during the largest portion of this adventure, which takes place in the ruins of Kho. Take care not to fall back on this role too often, though—you don't want the PCs to overly rely on the witchwyrd and grow careless.

Usilket enters a trancelike state for 10 minutes, during which they can attempt to remove a disease or one of the following conditions: [[Clumsy]], [[Drained]], [[Enfeebled]], or [[Stupefied]]. To remove the disease or condition, Usilket must counteract the disease or condition with a [[Medicine]] check. Usilket can attempt to counteract a disease or condition present in another creature, as long as that creature remains adjacent to the witchwyrd during the entire meditation.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Powerful Fists** Usilket's fist Strikes are treated as [[Cold Iron Weapon]] and [[Silver Weapon]] and don't take penalties when making lethal attacks.</span>
