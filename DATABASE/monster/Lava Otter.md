# Lava Otter

These fiery otters frolic and hunt in the lava streams of the [[Plane of Fire]]. They're known to be highly territorial, instigating fights with rival otter families to compete for territory. Cautiously curious of strangers, entire packs have been known to descend upon anyone who attacks or event accidentally threatens a family member.

If a gallon or more of water touches the lava otter, or if it's affected by a water effect, its outer layer of lava hardens to a rocky shell, deactivating its molten form and imposing weakness 5 to bludgeoning damage. Molten form reactivates if the otter swims in lava for 1 minute.</span>

###  Familiar Poaching

Many greedy fire wizards wish to domesticate lava otters to act as their familiars, a sentiment loathed by most denizens of the [[Plane of Fire]]. While the otters' burning pelts serve as a deterrence for would-be poachers, numerous naari (fire geniekin) still take it upon themselves to patrol lava otter habitats to protect them from poaching
