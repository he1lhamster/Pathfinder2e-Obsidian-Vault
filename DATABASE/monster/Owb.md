# Owb

Commonly called owbs, or lesser owbs by more powerful owb prophets, most of these mysterious creatures focus on manipulating caligni culture. Among calignis, an owb hides from mortals they deem beneath them—even including calignis in their charge. An owb prefers to select one caligni leader to control from the shadows, manipulating them using charisma and magic. Through coersion of such agents, owbs maintain a steady hand in the politics of the community, either blessing and breaking pacts with other creatures or acting as intermediaries and ambassadors between calignis and powerful external entities.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Curse of Darkness** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (curse, darkness, evocation, occult) The owb inflicts a curse on one creature taking [[Persistent Damage]] from their burning cold Strike, stealing the victim's vibrancy. The creature must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature gains [[Light Blindness]] and its coloration turns to washed out shades of gray, along with all equipment it carries, wields, or wears. These effects have an unlimited duration. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
 If the owb uses this ability on a [[Caligni]], the curse can't be removed short of [[Wish]] or similar powerful magic</span>
