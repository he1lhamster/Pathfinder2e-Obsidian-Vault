  resonated with Kirosthrek. Most of her kin feared the spirits of the past and looked
  only to the present and the future, but Kirosthrek dug into that past, hunting through
  the ruins of the long-dead xulgath empire around her for fragments of lost lore

  attention a high priest of [[DATABASE/deity/Zevgavizeb|Zevgavizeb]] calling himself
  Sarvel Ever-Hunger, leading a fierce conquest in the upper Darklands. He was a lesser

  easily subjugated, however, and while he welcomed the thoughtmaws'' addition to
  his might, Kirosthrek was forced to adjust her own plans and serve as Sarvel''s
  chief advisor. The priest''s interests were not so different from her own, she found;
  furthermore, he held his own scraps of knowledge about the ancient empire Kirosthrek
  so admired. From him, she learned that the vault they ruled had been known as Vask,
  and that some sudden tragedy had darkened the life-giving suns of that realm. She
  took that name to her daemonic allies, seeking to learn more about that catastrophe,
  and from them, she learned about Aroden''s theft. For Kirosthrek, this revelation
  was a clear directive: she would go find the sun-orbs Aroden had stolen and reclaim
  them, using their power to rebuild the empire of old.<br/><br/> And for a time,
  it seemed Sarvel shared her goals. The conquering high priest fixed his sights on
  the surface world, organizing an operation with enough subtlety and savvy that Kirosthrek
  began to consider him a suitable leader. But Sarvel''s true goal with the orbs is
  now clear to her: rather than reclaim the orbs, he wants them destroyed. Hoping
  to make the most of a plan gone wrong, Kirosthrek continues to aid Sarvel, but only
  from a lack of better options; her opinion of the priest now calling himself the
  Apocalypse Prophet continues to sour.'

# Kirosthrek

A cunning historian and summoner from a line of [[Xulgath]] who retain the psychic might of their fearsome ancestors, Kirosthrek serves [[Sarvel Ever-Hunger]] in the hopes of gaining the power she needs to restore the xulgaths' ruined Darklands empire. 
[[Xulgath Thoughtmaw]] are larger, more intelligent, and more powerful than others of their kind, and Kirosthrek has long embraced that truth. Where many of her kin heard only fanciful legend and exaggerated myth in the tales told by her clutch's elders, those recountings of powerful xulgaths ruling the Darklands resonated with Kirosthrek. Most of her kin feared the spirits of the past and looked only to the present and the future, but Kirosthrek dug into that past, hunting through the ruins of the long-dead xulgath empire around her for fragments of lost lore and forgotten secrets.
 Bit by bit, Kirosthrek expanded her knowledge. From ancient texts, she began to piece together even more powerful spells and rituals. Others in her clutch came to fear the ancient magic she commanded, and so she found herself with followers willing to do her bidding if she spared their minds. She took her elders' place, telling not mere tales but true histories of their people, of the Darklands vault they once ruled and the abrupt end of that empire. The thoughtmaws were the true descendants of that empire, she insisted, and some day they would rule it again.
 The isolated clutch she led was too small to retake an empire single-handedly, so Kirosthrek sought allies. This search brought to her attention a high priest of [[Zevgavizeb]] calling himself Sarvel Ever-Hunger, leading a fierce conquest in the upper Darklands. He was a lesser xulgath, but one infused with fiendish might and the blessings of a demon lord, and so Kirosthrek led her clutch to join forces with this new conqueror, hoping to subjugate the priest into furthering her own goals.
 Sarvel was not easily subjugated, however, and while he welcomed the thoughtmaws' addition to his might, Kirosthrek was forced to adjust her own plans and serve as Sarvel's chief advisor. The priest's interests were not so different from her own, she found; furthermore, he held his own scraps of knowledge about the ancient empire Kirosthrek so admired. From him, she learned that the vault they ruled had been known as Vask, and that some sudden tragedy had darkened the life-giving suns of that realm. She took that name to her daemonic allies, seeking to learn more about that catastrophe, and from them, she learned about Aroden's theft. For Kirosthrek, this revelation was a clear directive: she would go find the sun-orbs Aroden had stolen and reclaim them, using their power to rebuild the empire of old.
 And for a time, it seemed Sarvel shared her goals. The conquering high priest fixed his sights on the surface world, organizing an operation with enough subtlety and savvy that Kirosthrek began to consider him a suitable leader. But Sarvel's true goal with the orbs is now clear to her: rather than reclaim the orbs, he wants them destroyed. Hoping to make the most of a plan gone wrong, Kirosthrek continues to aid Sarvel, but only from a lack of better options; her opinion of the priest now calling himself the Apocalypse Prophet continues to sour.

## Campaign Role

Kirosthrek is not the heroes' ally, but neither is she an unreasonable zealot. She fights alongside Sarvel and views the heroes as soft-skinned surface dwellers who don't deserve the privileges that have benefited them throughout their lives. But she is a quick thinker and a survivor; if the odds are obviously stacked against her, she doesn't hesitate to prioritize her own self-preservation. She doesn't like the heroes, but she respects their power, and she is no stranger to bartering with powerful beings for their aid.
 Should the heroes defeat Sarvel while Kirosthrek lives, she loses all interest in the surface campaign. Her first instinct is to flee, but if the heroes offer a truce, she's also willing to negotiate with them. She doesn't limit her opening requests, however: she wants the _aeon orbs_ so she can restore the xulgath empire in the Vault of the Black Desert. She also isn't any kinder or gentler than other xulgaths, and she makes no attempt to hide her intentions of subjugating and enslaving other peoples in the areas she intends to claim (such as the [[Urdefhan]] and [[Drow]] that now live in what she considers xulgath lands). Even so, the heroes may feel they owe the xulgaths some form of reparations for Aroden's theft millennia ago, and Kirosthrek is willing to entertain reasonable offers to benefit her people, in lieu of the _aeon orbs_. The details and repercussions of such an arrangement are beyond the scope of this adventure.
