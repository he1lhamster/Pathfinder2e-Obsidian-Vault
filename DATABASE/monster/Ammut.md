# Ammut

These chimeric, desert-dwelling fiends have massive bodies that are part hippopotamus, part large cat, and part crocodile. Though they devour souls for sustenance, ammuts are infamously picky eaters; most will only eat experienced adventurers or, for a special treat, particularly evil creatures, passing over common folk or those whose mettle has never been tested. 
Only a few ammuts are known to exist, and most dwell in Osirion. However, recent expeditions into Orv's Vault of the Black Desert have uncovered the existence of ammuts in this region, as well.

The conditions cannot be mitigated until the curse is removed, and the curse cannot be removed until all damage dealt by the claw Strike is healed. Each day, a creature afflicted with wasting wound must attempt another saving throw; on a failed save, the values of its enfeebled and drained conditions each increase by 1. If the victim dies while cursed, its soul is destroyed, as per the ammut's devour soul ability.</span>

###  Ammut Diet

In an article published in volume 36 of the _Pathfinder Chronicles_, Tarana Geshepalamori recounts surviving an ammut attack after the beast dismissed her as “a bland soul.” She subsequently interviewed the fiend, who shared that an ammut “tastes” souls in much the same way a chef tastes the elements of a dish; the most delectable souls are those that have faced (or, especially, inflicted) great suffering and evil.
