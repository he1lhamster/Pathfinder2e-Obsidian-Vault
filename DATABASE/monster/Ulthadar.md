description: 'Once a devout priest of Aroden, Ulthadar is a cantankerous ghost who
  haunts Moonstone Hall, a tragic and eccentric remnant of the site''s long history<br/><br/>
  In life, Ulthadar was a cleric of Aroden and one of the founding priests of Moonstone
  Hall. Ulthadar was a young adult when the temple''s foundations were laid, and he
  remained active in the temple''s hierarchy until his death, dedicating his life
  to serving his deity through administration, prayer, and scholarship. Though he
  served as the temple''s first high priest for 20 years before his death, Ulthadar
  never excelled at ministering to the public. Like many who once dwelled within Moonstone
  Hall, he was an ascetic who preferred meditation and study to preaching and proselytizing.
  As high priest, he grudgingly spent time away from his true calling to give weekly
  sermons, but he was never a charismatic figure among his order. In fact, those who
  knew him considered him peevish at best; yet they suffered his abrasive personality
  for his deep well of religious knowledge and his talents for administering the many
  functions Moonstone Hall provided to the city of Escadar. Ulthadar left Moonstone
  Hall as rarely as possible, seeing in its gleaming walls and stately fixtures the
  truest connection to his god.<br/><br/> When Ulthadar passed away in his sleep,
  his attachment to Moonstone Hall tethered his soul to it. Instead of moving on to
  dwell in Aroden''s extraplanar realm, his soul instead remained in his longtime
  home. In a twisted way, becoming a ghost granted Ulthadar his greatest wish: he
  was given an eternity to peruse the temple''s library, contemplate religious matters,
  and enjoy the silence of the Moonstone Sanctum.<br/><br/> In death, Ulthadar relinquished
  his role as a guiding force for his order; in fact, many of those who lived and
  worked in Moonstone Hall remained unaware of the ghost''s presence. Ulthadar only
  rarely interacted with the physical world, such as to organize the library to his
  preferences when careless priests misfiled books.<br/><br/> Over 100 years ago,
  Aroden''s death shook the foundations of Moonstone Hall and threatened Ulthadar''s
  tranquil existence. Bereft of their divine powers, the living priests abandoned
  the temple and the city soon claimed the site, erecting new buildings directly above
  the temple. Meanwhile, in the temple that was now situated below ground, Aroden''s
  disappearance created fractures in Ulthadar''s consciousness. Even as a ghost, he''d
  always felt the presence of Aroden within the walls of Moonstone Hall. Now, this
  presence is gone, and Ulthadar restlessly searches for his lost connection to his
  deity.<br/><br/> Ulthadar''s last century has seen him become increasingly forgetful
  and confused. Before Aroden''s death, Ulthadar understood and enjoyed his existence
  as one of Moonstone Hall''s resident spirits, most of whom knew and respected him.
  Now, he fluctuates between episodes in which he believes he and his god are alive,
  and painful moments of clarity during which Ulthadar agonizes under the realization
  that his god is dead and that he is virtually alone in a crumbling ruin.<br/><br/>
  The recent [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Xulgath|xulgath]] incursion distracted Ulthadar
  from his personal torment. Now, the ghostly priest wants nothing more than to banish
  the invaders from his temple. He''s watched as these invaders from below and a thieving
  [[DATABASE/ancestry/Catfolk|catfolk]] from the city above have plundered and vandalized
  his temple. He''s proven insufficiently powerful to repel the xulgaths, and the
  catfolk is far too skilled at slipping past him when he''s distracted by his troubles.<br/><br/>
  Ulthadar may be impotent to stop the defilement of Moonstone Hall, but he''s managed
  to keep one of the temple''s [[DATABASE/equipment/Moonstone Diadem|moonstone diadems]]
  out of the intruders'' hands. He''s aware that the xulgath seek to corrupt the temple
  and use the moonstone pools for their own purposes, though he''s unsure what those
  purposes may be. He operates as he often has, from hiding, although this time he
  seeks to confound and undermine the invaders rather than spend his days in pious
  contemplation.<br/><br/> As a ghost, Ulthadar appears much as he did in life: as
  a white-bearded, elderly human who wears priestly robes of green and gold. He wears
  a <i>moonstone diadem</i> on his brow, and his connection to Moonstone Hall is not
  only strong enough to allow him to interact with the item, but sufficient to prevent
  its removal from his head unless he wills it. CAMPAIGN ROLE Ulthadar initially distrusts
  the heroes; he''s angry about the xulgaths vandalizing his temple and he assumes
  that the heroes are new threats to his home. If he learns the heroes oppose the
  xulgaths, he realizes the they might be able to expel the intruders. Ulthadar then
  becomes a staunch ally, although he remains an irritable, ancient ghost who''s prone
  to cryptic phrasing, long-winded explanations, and depressive episodes.<br/><br/>
  Ulthadar isn''t a constant presence in Moonstone Hall, but his ability to move freely
  throughout the area means he can show up at any time. Several interactions with
  Ulthadar are included in the adventure''s text, but you can create unscripted encounters
  with the ghost if the heroes want to work more closely with him. Ulthadar is an
  ideal agent to steer the heroes'' exploration of Moonstone Hall without stealing
  their thunder, particularly if the players are struggling to interpret their findings
  or figuring out how to use the moonstone pools.<br/><br/> Ultimately, Ulthadar''s
  role in the adventure depends on the players'' choices. They might strive to destroy
  him, or they can look past Ulthadar''s frustrating personality and undead nature
  to work toward their common goal of expelling the xulgaths. This is the best way
  for the heroes to learn what the <i>aeon orbs</i> do and why the xulgaths have come
  to destroy them. <br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Spirit</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]]

Once a devout priest of Aroden, Ulthadar is a cantankerous ghost who haunts Moonstone Hall, a tragic and eccentric remnant of the site's long history
