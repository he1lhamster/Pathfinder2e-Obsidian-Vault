# Mezlan

The bizarre shapeshifters known as mezlans were created ages ago as spies and infiltrators by a long-forgotten ritual infusing a magically constructed ooze with the soul of an exceptional sapient being. Having long since outlasted their creators, mezlans most often dwell alone amongst the ruins of the ancient civilizations they served as mortals.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Absorb Spell <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** The mezlan succeeds at a saving throw against a single-target spell; **Effect** The mezlan absorbs the spell, nullifying its effect and storing it for later. They can Cast the Spell using the original caster's spell attack modifier and DC. They can store only one spell at a time, but they can absorb a new spell to replace the spell they currently have stored. A willing caster can allow the mezlan to Absorb a Spell without requiring a save.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Discorporate** When the mezlan is reduced to 0 Hit Points, their body dissolves into colorless slime and begins seeping into nearby cracks or porous surfaces. If this material is not immediately contained or destroyed, the mezlan will eventually re-form, though they may lie dormant for years or even decades before doing so.</span>

###  Keepers of Secrets

Despite their strange nature, all mezlans retain the minds of the individuals they were before being transformed, making them potential repositories of knowledge long forgotten by any living creature. However, millennia of isolation have rendered most mezlans' personalities eccentric at best, with inscrutable motivations, so explorers brave enough to seek them out are advised to be wary
