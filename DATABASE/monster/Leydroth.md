# Leydroth

In ancient times, a cabal of primalists imbued an amalgam of beasts with both supernatural might and a hatred of magic itself, hoping to achieve a potent weapon for use against arcane spellcasters. Effective beyond expectation, the first leydroths broke free and turned on their creators. Worse, the leydroths bred true, and these reclusive predators have long outlived their original creators.
 Leydroths look like distorted, apelike felines with many-branching horns growing from the backs of their heads. Their thickly muscled limbs end in glowing claws.

###  Leydroth Legacy

On Golarion, the first leydroths were created by a secret society of Azlanti sorcerers who drew their powers from elemental bloodlines. These sorcerers clashed often against various wizardly guilds who held power throughout the various regions of Azlant, and intended for leydroths to serve as weapons of terror against their foes. Today, leydroths remain isolated on certain particularly dangerous islands among the remnants of the shattered continent of Azlant, but now and then foolish explorers seek to transport them back to the mainland.
