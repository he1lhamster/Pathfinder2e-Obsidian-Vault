# Lyrakien (Wanderer Azata)

Lyrakiens are musical messengers and embodiments of free travel. They serve [[Desna]] and other deities and empyreal lords of [[Elysium]], but are quite fond of the concept of free time and are always on the hunt for opportunities to pause in their duties to enjoy music or appreciate a moment of beauty. They love contests, stories, and songs, and they often challenge mortals to musical contests or pester them to share grand tales of their exploits. Lyrakiens rely on their agility to avoid conflicts, but they do their best to defend places of great natural beauty, especially against lawful or evil foes they can damage with their starlight. Lyrakiens have an innate wanderlust and rarely stay in the same place for very long. Some travel alongside adventurers, ofter writing songs about their quests and feats of derring-do.
Though light-hearted creatures, lyrakiens don't let their whimsical personalities get in the way of protecting breathtaking natural locations. Often called “glistenwings” by [[Gnome]] and [[Halfling]], they are frequently mistaken for [[Sprite]] or similar fey, a bit of confusion that many lyrakiens find amusing and fertile ground for shenanigans involving those they deem deserving of a bit of unexpected fun and discord in their lives.
