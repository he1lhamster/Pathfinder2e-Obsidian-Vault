**No Face** Noppera-bos have no sense of vision, but their sense of hearing is precise. They don't breathe and are immune to effects that require breathing. They gain sustenance by absorbing fluids through their skin—traditionally by immersing their hands or faceless head into the fluid to “drink” through osmosis; they can also benefit from consumables, such as potions or elixirs, in this way.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Impersonate Shape** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The noppera-bo changes into a Small or Medium humanoid they've touched during the last 24 hours, and the noppera-bo gains the target creature's face and voice. While transformed and their face is covered, the noppera-bo gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Impersonate that creature. As long as the noppera-bo has a face, it loses its no face ability and its listed immunities. The noppera-bo can change back by using this ability again.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Remove Face** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, occult, visual Requirements The noppera-bo trickster is [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonating]]) **Effect** The noppera-bo trickster's facial features melt into nothingness, and they menace a creature within 30 feet.

The creature must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save.
 **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
 **Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the start of its next turn.
 **Failure** The noppera-bo gains the target's face. The target's face vanishes until the end of its next turn. Until then, it is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]], can't speak or ingest, and can't smell. The target must also hold its breath or begin to suffocate.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the effect doesn't end automatically. The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such attempt.</span>
