<span class="in-box-ability">**Hungry Armor** A creature that Strikes a graveknight warmaster with a melee weapon must succeed at a DC 31 Reflex save or be [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|disarmed]] of that weapon. If the creature critically fails, the weapon ends up in the graveknight's space. A creature that hits a graveknight warmaster with an unarmed attack must succeed at a DC 31 Reflex save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] by the graveknight until the end of its next turn, it [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]], or the graveknight moves, whichever comes first.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rejuvenation** (divine, necromancy) When a graveknight is destroyed, their armor rebuilds their body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating their armor (such as with [[DATABASE/spell/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]), transporting it to the [[DATABASE/plane/Positive Energy Plane|Positive Energy Plane]], or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Sacrilegious Aura** (abjuration, aura, divine, evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a positive spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to counteract it, with a +23 counteract modifier.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> **</span>

Creatures in the area take 8d12 electricity damage (DC 34 basic Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Exemplar of Violence** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (visual) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The graveknight attempts a Strike as their armor flashes with sinister power that spurs allies to violence. After the Strike, allies who can see the graveknight can use a reaction to Step or Stride, but they must end this movement in a space adjacent to an enemy. One ally of the graveknight's choice can instead use a reaction to Strike.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Graveknight's Curse** This curse affects anyone who wears a graveknight's armor for at least 1 hour; **Saving Throw** DC 39 Will save; **Onset** 1 hour; **Stage 1** [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]] and can't remove the armor (1 day); **Stage 2** doomed 2, hampered 10, and can't remove the armor (1 day); **Stage 3** dies and transforms into the armor's graveknight</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Phantom Mount** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (arcane, conjuration) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per [[DATABASE/spell/Phantom Steed|phantom steed]], heightened to 7th level. The steed has AC 34, Fort +23, Ref +20, Will +20, and 85 Hit Points. If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ruinous Weapons** Any weapon or unarmed attack the graveknight uses gains the effects of the _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]]_ and [[DATABASE/equipment/Shock|greater shock]] weapon runes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Weapon Master** The graveknight has access to the critical specialization effects of any weapons they wield.</span>
