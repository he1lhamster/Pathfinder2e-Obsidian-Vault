# Hieracosphinx

Lacking the intelligence of their kin, falcon-headed hieracosphinxes are cowardly, cruel-hearted creatures. They guard their territory ruthlessly against weaker intruders.

<span class="in-box-ability">**[[Buck]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** DC 23</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Contingent Glyph** (abjuration, occult) A hieracosphinx has an innate magical defense similar to a [[Contingency]]. When they take a specific type of energy damage (varying by the individual sphinx), they can use their reaction to have the glyph cast [[Haste]] on them. The glyph is then dormant for 1 week. A critical success to [[Recall Knowledge]] about a particular hieracosphinx (30 or higher on the check) reveals which damage type triggers the glyph.</span>

###  Jealous Predators

Hieracosphinxes share none of the fondness for riddling talk and clever conversation typical of their more intelligent kin. They nonetheless envy their cousins' power, wisdom, and grace, and sometimes gather in flocks to take down stronger rival sphinxes out of sheer spite and jealousy.
