# Adult Forest Dragon

Forest dragons oversee the endless growth of nature, protect it from plunder, and reclaim ruins for the wilderness. Some say these dragons jealously hoard nature's bounty for themselves while seeing everyone else who tries to benefit from nature as thieves and poachers. They loathe the progress of technology and civilization, preferring the company of monsters and animals.
 Forest dragons are their forests in a literal sense. Over time, their hair becomes mossy, their hide toughens like bark, and small insects or animals live within them.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (evocation, primal) The dragon unleashes a swarm of insects that deals 14d6 piercing damage in a 40-foot cone (DC 34 basic Reflex save) before dispersing. A creature that critically fails is [[Stunned]] from the insects' venom; this is a poison effect. The dragon can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Coiling Frenzy** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The dragon makes one claw Strike and one tail Strike in either order, each against the same target.

Each living creature in a 30-foot emanation takes 7d10 negative damage (DC 34 basic Fortitude save). Creatures made entirely of water and plant creatures use the outcome one degree of success worse than they rolled. The dragon regains Hit Points equal to half of the highest damage a single creature takes from this effect.
 In addition, all non-creature plant life in the area withers and dies, eliminating non-magical undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and concealment. Water is also consumed in the same way, typically lowering any standing body of water fully within the area by 1 foot.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Forest Shape** When casting [[Tree Shape]], a forest dragon can become a tree of the same size and age as themself.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Greater Constrict]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> 3d8+10 bludgeoning, DC 34</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Woodland Stride** The forest dragon ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from non-magical foliage.</span>
