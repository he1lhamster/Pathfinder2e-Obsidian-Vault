# Kasesh

In the ancient days, before humanity dwelled on Golarion, the Vault Builders had need of something smaller in scale than the great vault seeds so they could finish their worlds as they liked. They took a small gem and wrote a word of power upon it. They gave it eyes so it could see and legs so it could walk, and made it wise. These creatures are known as kaseshi by scholars who have encountered them, though their true name—the one that brought them into being—is likely considerably more powerful.
 Each kasesh bears a single word of power on their emerald body, from which they draw their mind and their magic. A kasesh with the word “Steel” or “Flame” is a single-minded creature, though it encompasses all possible permutations of meaning that the word possesses. A kasesh named “Home” or “Sorrow” has a far more complex psyche, and rumor claims that Elder Architect Oblosk of Nex bears the word “Memory.” Unsurprisingly, many scholars are highly interested in the words on the kaseshi; unlike Thassilonian rune magic, no one has managed to decode or make use of the language of the Vault Builders yet.
 The kasesh in the stat block bears the word “Stone,” but other kaseshi will have their own magics. Some alternative examples, “Darkness” and “Intricacy,” follow below.
 **Darkness**: This kasesh built the hidden places of the Vault Builders' worlds. The kasesh is 7th level, grants [[Shadow Blast]] and [[Shadow Walk]] to any gestalt they join, and has the following innate spells.
 **Primal Innate Spells** 4th [[Darkness Domain]] (×2), [[Enervation]]; 3rd [[Blindness]] (×2), [[Share Lore]]; 1st mindlink; Cantrips (4th) [[Detect Magic]], [[Telekinetic Projectile]]
 **Intricacy**: This kasesh was a decorator and designer. They're 11th level, grant [[Hallucinatory Terrain]] and [[Illusory Scene]] to any gestalt they join, and have the following innate spells.
 **Primal Innate Spells** 6th [[Phantasmal Calamity]], [[Phantasmal Killer]] (×2); 5th [[Cloak of Colors]], [[Hallucination]], _share lore_; 1st [[Mindlink]]; Cantrips (6th) _detect magic_, _telekinetic projectile_
**Recall Knowledge - Elemental ([[Arcana]], [[Nature]])**: DC 20
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 18
**Specific Lore**: DC 15

<span class="in-box-ability">**Gestalt** (mental, primal, transmutation) Two or more kaseshi can combine their scribed words to create something greater than either one alone. This has the effects of the [[Coven]] ability but no ritual is necessary, simply close proximity for 8 hours. All gestalts grant the following spells, which the gestalt can cast at any level up to 5th: [[Creation Domain]], [[Strange Geometry]], and [[Telekinetic Haul]]. Individual kaseshi also grant additional spells to any gestalt they join—this one grants [[Meld into Stone]] and [[Shape Stone]].</span>

###  Kasesh Gestalts

Much as words combine to form sentences, so too when three or more kaseshi meet, their magic—and with it their very identities—combines and coalesces into something new. Most kaseshi find this process no less disconcerting than a human would, although some forge lifelong bonds in such a way.
 There's no limit to how large a gestalt might grow. What a gestalt of a dozen kaseshi can accomplish, only the Vault Builders knew.
