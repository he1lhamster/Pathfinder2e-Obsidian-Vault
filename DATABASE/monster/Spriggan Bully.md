# Spriggan Bully

The typical spriggan is a bully who prefers to take live prisoners in fights, but only to ensure that they have a large stock of living victims to torment, tease, and abuse. They train to use weapons in nonlethal ways that inflict the maximum amount of pain even as they guard against accidental death. When not bullying prisoners or hunting for new victims, spriggan bullies enjoy drinking, watching others fight, and fighting among themselves.
