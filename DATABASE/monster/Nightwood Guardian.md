# Nightwood Guardian

The nightwoods are parts of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]] permanently bathed in darkness due to an absence of fluorescent plants. Here, the flora and fauna require darkness, not light, to thrive. [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Troll|Troll]]-like creatures known as nightwood guardians patrol these woods to ensure they remain in perpetual shadow. Considering themselves righteous gardens, they care little for the excuses of anyone else—intruders or residents. The guardians absolutely loathe the light, though it doesn't harm them as it does some varieties of creatures. Though wary of both light and any interloping lifeforms in their natural habitat, a nightwood guardian's fear turns easily to wrath, making the guardian a force of fury who seeks to drive out intruders.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Fire-fueled Rage** When a nightwood guardian takes fire damage, they become enraged. The guardian gains 15 temporary Hit Points, deals 2 additional damage with melee Strikes, and has a –1 penalty to AC. They can't Raise their Shield or use actions with the concentrate trait except for [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]]. This effect ends when the nightwood guardian no longer observes any fire for 1 round or when they fall [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], whichever comes first.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Flesh of Wood** (primal, wood) Wounds inflicted on a nightwood guardian turn their flesh to wood. When the guardian is reduced to 40 HP or fewer, their body becomes solid wood. They are [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned]], have resistance 10 to all damage, and have [[DATABASE/monsterability/Regeneration|regeneration]] 40 (deactivated by fire). This ends once the guardian has 100 HP or more, though they can choose to stay in this form indefinitely.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Shield Eyes** When a nightwood guardian has their shield raised, they protect their eyes, losing the [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] conditions from light blindness and other light effects.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** </span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Shield Block|Shield Block]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** </span>

###  Rare Gentleness

Though most encounters with nightwood guardians end in violence, the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]] has many folktales about these giant creatures escorting youngsters lost in the nightwoods safely out of the darkness. Whether these stories are true or wishful thinking is debated, with some arguing that a nightwood guardian would only perform such a kindness on the orders of another creature
