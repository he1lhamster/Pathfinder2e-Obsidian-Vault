# Fiddling Bones

To some, music is more than a hobby—it's an obsession. Every musician who lived and died for their craft runs the risk of returning as a fiddling bones, as do musicians who died before completing their magnum opus or receiving the accolades they believe they deserved. Driven to prove themselves even in undeath, fiddling bones often challenge famous performers to music duels.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Rhapsodic Flourish <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (abjuration, occult, sonic) **Trigger** The fiddling bones would roll a saving throw against an auditory or sonic effect; **Effect** The fiddling bones performs a refrain that deflects sonic vibrations. They roll a [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check in place of the triggering saving throw. Sonic feedback rebounds from the effect, dealing 1d6 sonic damage to the source of the triggering effect if the Performance check succeeded or 2d6 sonic damage to the fiddling bones on a failure.</span>

Each creature in a 30-foot emanation must attempt a DC 19 Will save. Fiddling bones are immune. The effect lasts until the end of the fiddling bones's next turn, but the fiddling bones can Sustain the effect on all affected creatures that remain within the emanation.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
 **Success** The creature can't use actions with the move trait except to dance, which uses the Stride action to move up to half the creature's Speed. If the creature has other Speeds, it can also dance using those modes of travel.
 **Failure** As success, and the creature must spend at least 1 action each turn dancing.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Destructive Finale** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (evocation, occult, sonic) **Requirements** Dance with Death is in effect; **Effect** The fiddling bones performs a boisterous finale. They choose a 30-foot cone or 15-foot emanation, and they deal 4d6 sonic damage to all creatures in that area (DC 21 basic Reflex save). Dance with Death immediately ends, and the fiddling bones can't use Dance with Death or Destructive Finale for 1d4 rounds.</span>

###  Skeleton Songs

_Word on the street is you're a rising star,
 Voice of an angel, demon on the guitar,
 You've piqued my interest,
 So let's have a contest,
 Song versus song,
 And the crowd determines the best.
 You're spitting notes but your voice is too little,
 I'll play you to this crowd even slicker than this fiddle._
