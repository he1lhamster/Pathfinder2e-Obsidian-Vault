# Scalathrax

These slippery, scaly horrors dwell in remote cave networks in the Darklands, preferring to nest in narrow fissures. When on the hunt, they flick barbs from their long legs, or spray down their foes with a clear, toxic oil. The same oil coats the scalathrax's body, all of which is quite flammable—whether it's coating a victim or the scalathrax itself.
 While a scalathrax appears feral, it's more intelligent than it seems and is capable of speaking in a wet, slithery voice. The vast majority of scalathraxes are foul-tempered and quick to anger, and most of them enjoy killing. It's possible to forge an alliance with a scalathrax, but doing so requires either constant bribes of new creatures to kill or a particularly intimidating personality—scalathraxes often respect bullies, seeing in them a mirror of their own cruel values.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Oily Scales** A scalathrax constantly sweats a glistening oil that makes it exceptionally slick. It treats the results of [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeeze]] or of any skill check to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] as one degree of success greater than the rolled result. A scalathrax loses this benefit for 1 minute after it takes any amount of fire damage.</span>

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature takes 1d8 poison damage. 
**Failure** The creature takes 2d8 poison damage. For 1 minute, the creature gains weakness to fire 5, and whenever the creature critically fails with an attack roll with a wielded weapon, it drops the weapon.

###  Scalathrax Oil

Scalathrax oil is a valuable alchemical component, but it's difficult to harvest and preserve. By spending 10 minutes and succeeding at a DC 21 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check, a character can extract 1 Bulk of scalathrax oil worth 20 gp from a recently killed scalathrax. If scalathrax oil is used to [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]] an alchemical item that deals fire damage or would benefit from the slippery quality of the oil, the crafter gains a +1 item bonus to their Crafting check. Scalathrax oil can be used as lantern oil, though it's often considered too valuable for such a mundane use.
