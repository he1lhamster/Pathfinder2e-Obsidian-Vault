# Mukradi

Fearsome centipede-like creatures, mukradis are three-headed predators with a devastating array of breath weapons. A Darklands version of the mukradi is rumored to exist. It’s said these variant mukradis have black scales, and all of their heads spew a black, acidic goo that animates before being reabsorbed by the mukradis.

###  From a God's Nightmares

The first mukradis are rumored to have spawned in the fevered nightmares of a sleeping demigod from a dimension beyond dreams, who perished as the first mukradis hollowed out its unconscious mind and used its flesh to transition into the mortal realm. This legend is likely nothing more than fancy, but it certainly speaks to the deadly nature of these immense monsters.
