# Adachros

When a nascent demiplane fails to coalesce, its quintessence sometimes collapses into an adachros, a dangerous entity that combines overwhelming mental potential with no exposure to alternate viewpoints. Some of these megalomaniacal beings are tyrants, creating illusory kingdoms populated by abducted creatures forced to validate the creator's views. A more altruistic adachros might seek out pupils to reeducate and advise—though often without their consent—while always pushing their students to accept whatever unique philosophy was involved in their creation. An adachros might abandon disciples who spurn them, but more often, they become a bitter enemy, intent on destroying the perceived heretics.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Self-Absorbed** The adachros denies any version of reality but their own.

The ioton sycophant can't move more than 120 feet from the adachros and crumbles after 1 minute. If the adachros gives it no other commands, the ioton sycophant spends its turn praising the adachros and affirming the adachros's infallibility; this grants the adachros 4d6 temporary Hit Points that last for as long as the ioton sycophant exists, and a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round.</span>

###  Unreliable Allies

To an adachros, every event contorts to support its paradigm or is fake. Clever sycophants can coax one into an alliance by framing a request as a way of furthering their goals. These alliances are fraught, however. Once an adachros discovers the ruse or twists the request, they become an implacable foe.
