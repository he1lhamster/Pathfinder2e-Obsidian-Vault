# Young Sky Dragon

Sky dragons live above the clouds near the summits of mountains. They maintain a strong religious tradition, a unique practice among imperial dragons that sets them apart as much as their wings do. Desperate souls risk steep cliffs and loose snow to seek these dragons' counsel, and most sky dragons gladly help those who make the journey, but they expel any express hostilities or badger without hesitation.
 The sky dragon's wings aren't true wings, but long fins fused to their forearms; their scales also form only very slowly. Young dragons coil tightly in their lairs as they absorb minerals that color and harden their scales. Even adults often wrap around pillars out of habit.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Countered by Fire** If the sky dragon takes fire damage, the elemental magic of metal within them is tempered.

This limitation ends if the dragon uses Breath Weapon.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Fed by Earth** (abjuration, divine) When a sky dragon is targeted by an earth spell or effect, they leave a cloud of pulverized dust and gravel that swirls in the eddies of the dragon's flight.
