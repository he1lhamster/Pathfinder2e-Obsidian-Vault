# Sordesdaemon (Pollution Daemon)

Hulks of sewage and daemonic flesh, sordesdaemons embody death through pollution and are among the newest types of daemons to appear on Golarion. Sordesdaemons are fiendishly clever and often seek to inspire mortals with new ideas and inventions that despoil the environment.

###  Daemonic Pollution

Sordesdaemons who aren't compelled to pursue a specific task often find their way into sewers beneath large cities, where they subjugate other creatures that wallow in filth, such as [[DATABASE/monster/Ofalth|ofalths]] and [[DATABASE/monster/Otyugh|otyughs]]. They think nothing of sacrificing these minions if it advances their own aims.
