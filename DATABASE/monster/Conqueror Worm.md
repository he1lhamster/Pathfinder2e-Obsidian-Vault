# Conqueror Worm

Conqueror worms are deeply malevolent creatures with terrifying magical power. They are highly intelligent and see societies as playthings, enacting far-reaching and tyrannical changes to reshape or break them as they please. Conqueror worms are patient, often waiting for years (or sometimes decades) to enact plans, all the while observing from their lairs. A conqueror worm that takes interest in a region mentally commands its figureheads, such as political leaders and key rebels, manipulating them and playing them off each other like game pieces from behind the scenes—most frequently, from well-defended subterranean chambers. 
Most conqueror worms' victims don't even realize they're subject to its machinations, but some who do end up serving the creature—or worshipping it. The worms have no regards for their supplicants and are inclined to dispose of them the moment they're unneeded.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Mental Invader** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (enchantment, mental, occult) **Trigger** A creature communicates telepathically with the conqueror worm (even to respond to the conqueror worm's telepathy or through a mental spell like sending) or fails a saving throw against a mental spell cast by the conqueror worm; **Effect** The conqueror worm infects the mind of the creature, allowing it to mentally contact the creature from afar.

This bond is permanent and can be broken only by miracle, wish, or similar magic. The conqueror worm can maintain a maximum of 10 connections with Mental Invader. If another creature would be infected, the worm must choose to one of its existing connections end, or if the worm prefers to keep its current 10 connections, the new creature isn't infected instead. </span><span class="in-box-ability">**Critical Failure** As failure, and for as long as the mental link lasts, the target uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw against mental spells cast by the conqueror worm. </span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Telepathic Escape** (enchantment, incapacitation, mental, occult, possession) When the conqueror worm dies, it telepathically projects its consciousness into a creature infected by its Mental Invader ability and who is on the same plane as the conqueror worm. The creature must succeed at a DC 48 Will save or it is overtaken by the conqueror worm. This has the same effect as the [[DATABASE/spell/Possession|possession]] spell with an unlimited duration, except the conqueror worm has wholly foregone its physical body. A host body possessed by a conqueror worm undergoes terrible changes. Every day, the host must succeed at a DC 48 Will save or become permanently [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] 1 (or increase its stupefied value by 1) and increasingly pale, balding, and bloated. When the host reaches stupefied 4, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around it. Over the next 24 hours, the host undergoes a swift metamorphosis and emerges as a new conqueror worm with all the memories of its previous incarnation. At this point, the host is dead and can't be restored except by [[DATABASE/spell/Miracle|miracle]], [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]], or similar magic. Before that point, however, this horrid transformation can be ended by any effect that expels the conqueror worm's possession, meaning would be slayers of a conqueror worm had best locate its consciousness and end the possession before it's too late and the worm rises again.</span>

### The End of the Game

A conqueror worm might toy with a society for generations, sculpting it into a model of subjugation or tyranny to fit the worm's evil whims. At times, the conqueror worm might erase the slate by engineering a coup that gives hope to the populace but simply replaces one evil regime with another. When it grows bored of these renovations, the conqueror worm leaves the society for good and moves on to another. This is by no means the end; a conqueror planning to leave a society takes pains to leave it in such a broken state that no conqueror worm would ever want it again. The worm might engineer upheavals, plagues, or wars so devastating that few members of the society are left alive, and only echoes of a lost and wicked nation remain.
