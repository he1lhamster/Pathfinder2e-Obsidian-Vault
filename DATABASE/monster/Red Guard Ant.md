# Red Guard Ant

The rank-and-file members of the ant colony are not much taller than a shrunken hero but are much more massive, at the relative size of an ox. They are somewhat intelligent but very focused, engaging in unquestioning toil if ordered by higher-ranking ants. Red guard ants nearly always attack in groups but might be encountered alone if, for example, ordered to perform solitary guard duty. They typically spray acid before marching into melee, but only when doing so doesn't pose a risk to their allies and won't jeopardize any other objective they've been ordered to achieve.
