# Clay Golem

Traditionally, clay golems are crafted in the image of a deity and used as guardians of tombs or sacred crypts. Clay golems have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.
 The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems are maintained and in good working order—or otherwise place them on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.

###  Clay Golems

The remains of clay golems are worth more to archaeologists and scholars than to merchants. The magnificent treasures often guarded by these ancient wardens, however, are another matter entirely.
