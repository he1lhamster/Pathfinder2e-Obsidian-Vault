# Living Graffiti

A living graffiti is a painting or drawing that has come to life by magic. These two-dimensional beings can move along any flat surface they touch, including walls, floors, furniture, doors, and even bodies of still water. They can't exist apart from the surfaces they traverse except in brief bursts, which they typically use to harass or attack nearby creatures. They exhibit a mischievous nature and desire to make the real world as much of a caricature as their own two-dimensional domain.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Backdrop** When a creature attempts to Strike a living graffiti and critically misses, the attacker hits the surface (a canvas, wall, or so on) behind the living graffiti. This might damage the surface or the attacker's weapon, at the GM's discretion.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Surface-Bound** A living graffiti can move only along flat surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed (such as a portrait hit by a [[DATABASE/spell/Fireball|fireball]] spell or a wall being smashed), the graffiti takes 2d6 damage and is shunted to the nearest flat surface. If there is no flat surface within 5 feet, the graffiti is destroyed.</span>

###  Difficult to Destroy

Adventurers claim that the most reliable way to destroy a living graffiti is to trap it on a levitating canvas or to abandon its host surface in a windy desert.

## Oil Living Graffiti Variants

Some variants of this creature have the following alternate rules that adjust the standard oil living graffiti stat block above. Despite these changes, their level remains the same.

### Variant Living Graffiti

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
Other living graffiti exist, made from media like chalk, pastels, ink, or tempera, or even more archaic materials like mud, beeswax, or blood. The following are a few examples of the kinds of abilities living graffiti in blood, chalk, or ink might have, respectively.
**Absorb Blood** Whenever a creature within 5 feet of the living graffiti takes slashing, piercing, or persistent bleed damage, the graffiti gains temporary HP equal to half the damage dealt to the adjacent creature.
**Cone of Chalk** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The living graffiti expels a 15-foot cone of chalk. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round or until it Interacts to wipe the chalk from its eyes. The living graffiti can't use Cone of Chalk again for 1d4 rounds.
**Inky Substance** The living graffiti has 60 maximum HP and its splatter Strike deals 2d6+4 damage (in addition to splatter), but it gains weakness 5 to water
