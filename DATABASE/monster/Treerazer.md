# Treerazer

Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, is a powerful demon on the cusp of ascending to the true power of one of the rulers of the Abyss itself—a demon lord. For now, even as a nascent demon lord, Treerazer is a dangerous foe.
 Treerazer rarely leaves his swampy realm of Tanglebriar—a large thicket of tainted foliage and rotting detritus just south of Kyonin’s Fierani Forest—but can be encountered anywhere within that toxic mire, often accompanied by a small legion of demons, corrupted fey, and other deadly allies. Certain occult rituals have the power to call him forth from Tanglebriar, granting him the opportunity to directly work his evils beyond the realm to which he has been exiled. Some believe that no eldritch force contains Treerazer and that, were he willing, he could travel Golarion with impunity, spreading the twisted blessings of his touch and the corruption of his presence, yet the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is as cunning and canny as he is deadly, and prefers to work his evils on the world from the safety of his nightmare realm.

###  Spawn of Cyth-V'sug

Treerazer was once the favored minion and lieutenant (some even say child) of the demon lord Cyth-V’sug, Lord of Fungus and Parasites. After a failed attempt to wrest that role in the Abyss away from Cyth-V’sug, Treerazer fled to the Material Plane. Cyth-V’sug was unable (or perhaps only unwilling) to pursue but took steps to ensure that Treerazer would remain there by exiling him, severing Treerazer’s bond to the Abyss—if the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is slain, his animus will not return to the Abyss and reform. Death, to Treerazer, is a permanent thing.

###  Treerazer's Cultists

Treerazer is worshipped by cultists throughout the Inner Sea region. The majority of these deranged maniacs can be found within or near the expanse of the Tanglebriar, consisting of fungus-corrupted fey, debased elves, or other sinister demon worshippers. Beyond Tanglebriar, his cultists are rarer and tend to be loners or leaders of very small groups. Treerazer’s religious symbol is a bleeding dead tree that’s been split in half.
