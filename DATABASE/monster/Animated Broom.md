# Animated Broom

Animated brooms perform menial tasks of cleaning and upkeep, but they can step in to defend a room from intrusion if needed. These simple animated objects can be found with greater frequency than more complicated and costly objects.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Construct Armor** Like normal objects, an animated broom has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an animated broom is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 14.</span>

Even if hit by multiple dust attacks, the creature has to spend only 1 action coughing to clear the dust out. A creature that doesn’t breathe is immune to this effect.</span>
