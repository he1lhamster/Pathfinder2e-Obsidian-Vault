# Yellow Musk Thrall

A creature transformed by a yellow musk creeper's tendrils boring into its brain becomes a yellow musk thrall if it's Small or Medium, or a yellow musk brute if Large (a Small creature becomes a Small thrall rather than a Medium one). The transformation takes 1 hour. A yellow musk thrall takes only the most rudimentary of actions: bringing the yellow musk creeper water and new creatures to infest. After a few days (or if the creeper dies), the thrall wanders off into the wilderness and falls dead within 24 hours. The body of a deceased thrall sprouts a new yellow musk creeper within hours of its death, becoming a fully grown plant within 24 hours.
