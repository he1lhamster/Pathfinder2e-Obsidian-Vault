# Imentesh

The loquacious proteans known as imenteshes serve as missionaries, spies, and heralds of chaos to further the protean goal of reality's dissolution. Imenteshes are cunning, curiously diplomatic, and profoundly whimsical. They travel beyond the [[DATABASE/plane/Maelstrom|Maelstrom]] for their work, frequently adopting extravagant personal attire and decorations that often border upon the garish, all to curry favor with less chaotic beings.

**Entropy Sense** (divination, divine, prediction) An imentesh can anticipate the most likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the imentesh the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Nondetection|nondetection]] or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Protean Anatomy** (divine, transmutation) An imentesh's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the imentesh takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> The imentesh is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]], the imentesh automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.</span>

###  Mouthpieces of Chaos

While rarely found on the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], imenteshes frequent interplanar hubs of culture and commerce. Imenteshes act as diplomats on behalf of any chorus they claim allegiance to. They can offer safe travel through the [[DATABASE/plane/Maelstrom|Maelstrom]] or even act as guides through the Maelstrom's ever-shifting Borderlands.
