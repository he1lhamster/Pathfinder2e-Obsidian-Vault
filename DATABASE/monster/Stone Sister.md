# Stone Sister

Stone sisters are the tragic undead remains of an ancient Holoma army, petrified en masse by the necromancer Geb. The armies of Holomog were once a dominant force in the region, repelling several invasions from powerful rivals. However, when they sought to expand into the nation of Geb, their campaign quickly ended. Shortly after crossing Geb's southern border, the entire army was struck by a terrible curse that turned every warrior into a stone statue. Now known as the Field of Maidens, the statues have stood frozen for centuries, weapons in hand.
 Yet some of these warriors possess a will even stronger than stone. When approached, there's a chance the spirits of the fallen will animate their statues and attack outsiders with the same deadly coordination they had in life.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Reconstitution** Until Geb's curse is broken, any stone sister who's destroyed gradually reforms in her original shape. A stone sister who's reduced to 0 Hit Points will reform after 24 hours, while one reduced to rubble or dust might take a year or more to reform. Stone sisters who are removed from the Field of Maidens always attempt to return to it when they reconstitute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Stone Flesh** A stone sister is made of a bizarre stone that never stops bleeding from numerous cracks along her skin. She reacts to certain spells in unique ways, as listed below.

* Spells that alter earth, such as [[DATABASE/spell/Shape Stone|shape stone]], either deal 3d10 points of damage or heal 3d10 Hit Points, as decided by the caster. If the spell is specifically harmful or beneficial to earth and stone, the GM might decide it can only harm the stone sister, or only heal her.
* [[DATABASE/spell/Stone to Flesh|Stone to flesh]] doesn't revert a stone sister to flesh and blood but instead weakens her. She loses her resistance to physical damage for 1 minute. If she's reduced to 0 Hit Points during this time, she's permanently destroyed and can't reform.

The clumsy condition can be temporarily relieved for 24 hours by casting [[DATABASE/spell/Stone to Flesh|stone to flesh]] on the cursed creature but can't be removed or reduced by any other means short of removing the curse; during this time, the cursed creature also no longer receives the status bonus to AC.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Statue** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate) Until the next time she acts, the stone sister appears to be a statue. She has an automatic result of 34 on [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks and DCs to pass as a statue. Since the Field of Maidens is filled with thousands of statues just like her, most of which aren't stone sisters, it's incredibly difficult to recognize her true nature.</span>
