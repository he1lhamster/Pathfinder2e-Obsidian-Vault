<span class="in-box-ability">**Long Neck** An elasmosaurus's long neck allows it to interact with the surface while its body remains submerged underwater. While submerged no deeper than 15 feet underwater, an elasmosaurus can still stick its head up to breathe. An elasmosaurus gains cover against attacks made against creatures who are above the water's surface while it is underwater, even if its head is above the surface.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]]** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Jaws only.</span>
