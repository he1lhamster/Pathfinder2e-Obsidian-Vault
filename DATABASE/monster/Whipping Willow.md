# Whipping Willow

These tall, thin figures are too treelike to be [[Dryad]], yet too humanoid to be [[Arboreal]]. Their blank faces and thin trunks bear only the slightest suggestion of humanoid features. Rather than hands, their long, branchlike arms eventually split into equally proportioned branchlike digits, which the willows use both to fight and swing through their native plane.
