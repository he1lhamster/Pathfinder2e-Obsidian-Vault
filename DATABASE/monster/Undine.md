description: "Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal\
  \ beast that swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in\
  \ minutes. Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called\
  \ the Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee.<br/><br/> Umonlees are\
  \ bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service of a hunger that\
  \ is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are semi-intelligent\
  \ creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are not terribly\
  \ bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafficked areas. It is\
  \ rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse group,\
  \ such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path of Aganhei\u2014\
  the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that crosses the\
  \ Crown of the World\u2014have had their expeditions abruptly ended by an encounter\
  \ with one of these monstrosities.<br/><br/> Those who study monsters posit that\
  \ umonlees are related to [[DATABASE/monster/Chuul|chuuls]] , as the creatures exhibit\
  \ some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean predators that use ambush\
  \ tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they can talk, umonlees typically\
  \ only speak [[DATABASE/language/Aklo|Aklo]] , which also gives credence to this\
  \ theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Alghollthu|alghollthu]]\
  \ manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these alien designs.\
  \ However, the fact that these creatures aren't evil argues well against such a\
  \ theory.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Beast</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]]\

# Undine

Undines are infused with elemental water—the churning power of the briny deep flows through them. These planar scions are often athletic and lithe, but they are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how much louder and clearer sound rings above the waves.
 Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming communities along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter case, they prefer to settle in ship-towns that sometimes number dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes. The undines who fill these communities are similarly diverse, bringing aspects of multiple cultures together to form one whole. Ship-towns are permanent, but fluid—they grow, recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add their ships to or remove them from the flotilla. An undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its residents coming ashore only on rare occasions to collect wood for cookfires or to repair their homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence of these communities reflects the undine virtues of adaptability and freedom, while also maintaining the prime importance of the community.
 Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these floating settlements, if only for their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.
