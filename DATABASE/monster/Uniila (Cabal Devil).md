description: "Symbols of grace and purity, unicorns resemble proud and noble horses.\
  \ They are typically pure white of coat, but they are best known for the single,\
  \ delicate horn that extends from the center of their forehead. While unicorns often\
  \ serve as protectors of unspoiled wilderness and sacred places, they are themselves\
  \ highly sought after for their horns, which are said to possess potent magical\
  \ properties. To many, the mere idea of hunting such a magnificent creature in the\
  \ hopes of severing its horn is utterly reprehensible. Indeed, a de-horned unicorn\
  \ is a sorry sight, and few such unicorns survive much longer in the wild.<br/><br/>\
  \ Unicorns are found almost exclusively in remote, unsullied areas of wilderness.\
  \ Sometimes associated with good-aligned deities, other times associated with nature\
  \ and the fey, unicorns are always known for their righteousness and nobility. They\
  \ are wary, at best, of most humanoid creatures, due in large part for poachers\u2019\
  \ tendency to hunt them for their horns, but unicorns are often rumored to have\
  \ a weakness for those who are pure of both heart and spirit. Despite some tales,\
  \ unicorns are equally likely to recognize purity in young men as in young women.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Uniila (Cabal Devil)

Uniilas frequently join mortal cults, but not as leaders—instead, the uniila lurks behind the master or demagogue who leads the cult.

When the _witch token_ is invested by a mortal, all of the mortal's spells, except those cast at the highest level the mortal can cast, count as 1 level higher for the purpose of counteracting other spells and being counteracted. The creature can also Activate the _witch token_ to Cast a Spell once per day. This spell is chosen from one of the uniila's arcane spontaneous spells of level 4 or lower when the uniila creates the token. While a creature has the _witch token_ invested, it treats its saving throws against the uniila's spells as one degree of success worse, and the uniila always knows the distance and direction to the creature. A creature can't have more than one _witch token_ invested, and an uniila can't have more than one _witch token_ in existence. The uniila can destroy their _witch token_ as a free action with the concentrate trait; if the _witch token_ is invested when the uniila does so, the creature that has the witch token invested takes 9d8 mental damage (DC 29 basic Will save).</span>

###  Uniila Occultists

Some uniilas study occult magic, rather than arcane magic, to better manipulate mystery cults or eldritch cabals. These more subtle uniilas cast occult spells instead of arcane spells; they cast [[DATABASE/spell/Augury|augury]] instead of [[DATABASE/spell/Glitterdust|glitterdust]], [[DATABASE/spell/Mind Reading|mind reading]] instead of [[DATABASE/spell/Lightning Bolt|lightning bolt]], [[DATABASE/spell/Modify Memory|modify memory]] instead of [[DATABASE/spell/Fireball|fireball]], and [[DATABASE/spell/Read Aura|read aura]] instead of [[DATABASE/spell/Ray of Frost|ray of frost]].
