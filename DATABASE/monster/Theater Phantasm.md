**Bonded Theater** A theater phantasm can't travel more than 50 feet from the theater (or similar location) where it was created.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Catharsis** (emotion, enchantment, mental, occult) When a theater phantasm is destroyed, it emits waves of emotional energy. All creatures within 50 feet take 10d6 mental damage (DC 34 basic Will save) as they experience a crushing barrage of emotions.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Dramatic Return** (necromancy, occult) A destroyed theater phantasm slowly reforms to full strength over the course of 1 week. The only way to permanently destroy the phantasm is to reduce it to 0 Hit Points during a performance occurring in its bonded theater.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Emotional Consumption** (emotion, necromancy, occult) If a theater phantasm is within 100 feet of an audience of 20 or more intelligent beings witnessing a performance in its bonded theater, it gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing]] 20.</span>

The phantasm designates a target other than itself within 50 feet with a subtle spotlight, giving the target a +2 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks and resistance 10 to mental damage for 1 minute. If it uses this ability again on a new target, the former creature loses its spotlight.</span>

###  Competing Phantasms

On very rare occasions, more than one theater phantasm takes up residence in the same theater, each trying to outdo the other.
