# Deculi

These batlike monstrosities inhabit the nooks and crevices of the Darklands, where they hang from stalactites and swoop down on unsuspecting prey. Though they are completely sightless, deculis possess rudimentary nerves in their skulls that allow them to detect the presence of infrared light—information they use to locate potential food and threats. They are deadly hunters, thanks largely to their magical ability to manipulate the ebb and flow of shadows. Deculis prefer to feed upon the warm blood of freshly killed prey, but they can subsist on carrion if they have to.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Create Shadow Sanctuary** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (conjuration, darkness, extradimensional, occult) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The deculi creates an extradimensional space adjacent to itself in any 10-foot-by-10-foot area of darkness and enters it. To non-deculis, the extradimensional space looks like an ordinary area of darkness (though effects such as [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]] can see through this illusion). The deculi’s infrared vision functions normally between this extradimensional space and the area outside its confines, allowing the deculi to sense what is going on around it, and its innate [[DATABASE/spell/Darkness|darkness]] spell also extends to the area around the shadow sanctuary. Attacks cannot be made into or from the extradimensional space.
 The deculi can Dismiss this effect to emerge from its shadow sanctuary, but the space it emerges into must be in darkness and must be unobstructed. If the area is obstructed, the deculi is shunted to the nearest available space and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet shunted. If the area overlaying the shadow sanctuary becomes illuminated by magical light, the extradimensional space can no longer be accessed and the deculi is trapped within until the area is once again in darkness. The deculi can try to extinguish a magical light effect obscuring its sanctuary once per day by attempting to counteract the light effect with its [[DATABASE/spell/Darkness|darkness]] innate spell.
 If a deculi dies (including from hunger, thirst, or asphyxiation) while within the extradimensional space, the shadow sanctuary immediately ends and the deculi’s corpse is expelled. If the area is illuminated, the corpse is not expelled until the sanctuary entrance is in darkness once again.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Shadow Strike** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirements** The deculi is in its shadow sanctuary. **Effect** The deculi Dismisses its shadow sanctuary.

###  Alien Origins

Monster scholars disagree on the origins of the deculi. The creature’s familiar batlike anatomy and predilection for caverns suggests an evolution in the Darklands, but its ability to dip in and out of its own personal extradimensional space is far from typical for purely subterranean creatures. Further complicating all of this is the deculi’s infrared vision, which anatomists agree is completely unheard of in mammalian species on Golarion. The most credible theories suggest that the deculi is not from Golarion at all, but arrived here long ago from some part of the Material Plane beyond the reckoning of most mortals.
