# Grave Hag

Rot-skinned grave hags usually lair in cemeteries, mausoleums, and other burial sites; unlike most hags, they can't alter their appearance into a comely shape, so they hide from most observers. Grave hags consider such a predatory life hiding out in graveyards to be pitiful and squalid—they prefer to dwell in lands where necromancy is common and undeath isn't unusual. These grave hags become adept at necromantic magic and love posing as scholars. Schemers and plotters, they surround themselves with minions whom they send on missions to collect corpses for ghastly rituals.

###  Grave Hag Arrogance

Grave hags often bear a sense of smug superiority and are quick to enumerate their advantages over other types of hags. They dismiss anything other hags can do but which they can't (such as changing shape) as valueless trickery. [[DATABASE/monster/Night Hag|Night hags]] provide a notable exception to this self-importance; many grave hags try to ingratiate themselves with night hags and emulate them when they can.
