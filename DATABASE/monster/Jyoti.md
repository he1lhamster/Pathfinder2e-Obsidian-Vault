# Jyoti

Jyotis are sometimes called “false phoenixes” (a term they find insulting) by the ignorant or willful. These avian humanoids are native to the [[DATABASE/plane/Positive Energy Plane|Positive Energy Plane]]. They rarely leave this enigmatic realm and view visitors from other planes as stains on the purity of their home. Jyotis particularly distrust divine spellcasters and religious warriors, seeing them as inclined to take credit for manifesting a life force that, from the jyotis' perspective, is as plentiful and ubiquitous as water is to fish.
 Despite their distrust of intruders, jyotis rarely attack unprovoked when their homes are not threatened. They are intolerant, however, of those who intrude on the palaces of crystallized light and captured flame in which they dwell. They often chase even those who come bearing gifts away; few visitors have anything they desire, for what they desire most is to be left alone. The jyotis' full wrath is reserved for natives of the [[DATABASE/equipment/Shadow|Shadow Plane]] and the [[DATABASE/plane/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]]. Historically, the promise of battle with the gargoyle-like [[DATABASE/monster/Sceaduinar|sceaduinars]], whom they consider it their duty to oppose, has been the only thing to lure jyoti armies beyond the Positive Energy Plane.

###  Crystal Vaults

Jyoti make ideal guardians for artifacts too dangerous to be left where those hungry for power might seize them. Only they know what items of myth and legend, long thought lost or destroyed, lie within their crystal vaults. They are unreliable guardians of religious artifacts, however, which usually disgust them.
