# Contemplative Mentor

As they near the next phase of their journey through existence, contemplative mentors split their time between unlocking the highest secrets of time and space, and guiding their students and less-talented peers.

**Unspecific Lore**: DC 41

<span class="in-box-ability">**Atrophied** A contemplative's limbs are withered and incapable of significant physical exertion. A contemplative can't properly wield a two-handed weapon or object without dedicating its telekinetic powers to supporting the weapon, and even then, it takes a –2 penalty to Strikes with such a weapon. It also can't use its spells or fly as long as it wields a two-handed weapon or object.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Project Calm** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (emotion, enchantment, mental, occult) The contemplative mentor projects a field of perfect calm in a 60-foot emanation. All creatures within the area of effect must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be unable to take hostile actions for 1 round. After using this ability, the contemplative is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]], or increases its drained value by 1 if it was already drained. A contemplative mentor can't use this ability if its drained value is 3 or more.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Temporal Suppression** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (enchantment, mental, occult) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The contemplative attempts to hinder a target creature's personal flow of time. The target must be within 60 feet, and once targeted must attempt a DC 40 Will save, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] on a failure or slowed 2 on a critical failure. Each time an affected creature ends its turn, its slowed value decreases by 1. A creature that critically succeeds on their save against Temporal Suppression is temporarily immune to it for 24 hours.</span>
