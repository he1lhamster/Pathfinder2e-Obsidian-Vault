description: "Reefclaws are aquatic monsters that resemble huge shrimp or lobsters.\
  \ As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw\u2019s oversized claws are powerful\
  \ weapons with their vicelike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate\
  \ prey.<br/><br/> While reefclaws can\u2019t speak, they are intelligent enough\
  \ to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The\
  \ creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the\
  \ best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment\
  \ value\u2014reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched\
  \ voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws\
  \ have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together\
  \ for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will\
  \ perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed\
  \ their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous\u2014they\u2019ve been\
  \ known to tip over small flshing boats and attack those who fall overboard.<br/><br/>\
  \ Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if\
  \ doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the\
  \ creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after its brains were leaking from\
  \ its broken skull, and even then the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last\
  \ slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are\
  \ often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves\
  \ and their offspring.<br/><br/> Despite their intelligence and the accompanying\
  \ moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of\
  \ land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have\
  \ a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet (for reefclaws\
  \ raised in colder waters) or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws).\
  \ Most civilized people who know of reefclaws\u2019 intellect find the act of eating\
  \ them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions,\
  \ for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fisherfolk\
  \ whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt\
  \ the dangerous creatures\u2014or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Relictner

Regardless of age, relictners look like ancient [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarves]] with deep wrinkles, sparse white hair, and decrepit forms. As their bodies degrade, so too do their surroundings, with even the finest architecture crumbling to ruins.

**Lair Sense** (detection, divination, divine) The relictner bonds with a single structure they consider their lair, such as a house, temple, or ruin. A relictner is aware of any creature that enters the lair, and the direction and approximate distance to the creature. If the lair is destroyed, the relictner can bond with a new lair by residing within a structure they own or claim for 1 week.
