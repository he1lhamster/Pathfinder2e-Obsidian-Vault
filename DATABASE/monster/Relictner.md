# Relictner

Regardless of age, relictners look like ancient [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarves]] with deep wrinkles, sparse white hair, and decrepit forms. As their bodies degrade, so too do their surroundings, with even the finest architecture crumbling to ruins.
**Recall Knowledge - Humanoid ([[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]])**: DC 35
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 33
**Specific Lore**: DC 30

**Lair Sense** (detection, divination, divine) The relictner bonds with a single structure they consider their lair, such as a house, temple, or ruin. A relictner is aware of any creature that enters the lair, and the direction and approximate distance to the creature. If the lair is destroyed, the relictner can bond with a new lair by residing within a structure they own or claim for 1 week.

The relictner radiates an aura of degradation. All objects in the area have their Hardness reduced by 10, to a minimum of 0, for as long as they remain in the aura and for 1 round after leaving it.

The relictner gains the undead trait and becomes immune to bleed, death effects, disease, [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], poison, and sleep. Any such effects the relictner is currently inflicted with are suspended but take effect again once they take a breath. Death Gasp lasts as long as the relictner holds their breath (up to 8 rounds).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Demolition** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (divine, evocation) The relictner bellows in fury, causing the surrounding structure to collapse. All creatures in a 30-foot emanation take 8d10 bludgeoning damage from falling debris (DC 31 basic Reflex save). A creature that fails its save is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. The area becomes difficult terrain. The relictner can't use Demolition again for 1d4 rounds.</span>
