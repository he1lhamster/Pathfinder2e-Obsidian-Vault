**Perception** +24; [[Darkvision]]
**Languages** [[Aklo]], [[Common]], [[Elven]], [[Infernal]], [[Shadowtongue]], [[Thassilonian]], [[Varisian]]; (can't speak any languages)

**Escape From Hell** (auditory, divine, emotion, fear, mental, necromancy) When Ileosa's shell is reduced to 0 HP, the hollow corpse immediately melts into a pool of blood, at the center of which lies her still-beating heart. A moment later, a crimson ghostly shape—Queen Ileosa's soul—rises from the heart. After the soul shrieks in relief at escaping from [[Hell]], it rises through the ceiling and vanishes while the heart dies and rots. All creatures within 30 feet of the shell when this occurs must attempt a DC 30 Will save.
 **Critical Success** A living creature becomes invigorated and elated by the sense of freedom from Hell, and becomes [[Quickened]] for 1 minute. The creature can use the extra action each round only for Strike and Stride actions. An undead creature gains no benefit.
 **Success** As success, but the creature can use the extra action only for Stride actions.
 **Failure** The creature becomes [[Frightened]].
 **Critical Failure** The creature becomes frightened 2.
