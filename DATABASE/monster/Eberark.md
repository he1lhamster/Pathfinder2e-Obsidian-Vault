# Eberark

The terrifying apex predators known as eberarks torment their prey, spewing oil from their mouths that they can then set alight. Commonly called flint beasts, eberarks drag their overlarge claws (four on each paw) along the ground as they move, creating showers of sparks with every grating step. Incredibly vain, eberarks relish displaying their dominance over other intelligent beings. Some eberarks conquer small settlements, demanding tribute from residents and travelers, or lead bands of violent brigands.

The creature must succeed at a DC 27 Reflex save or become [[Clumsy]] for as long as they are coated in incendiary spit. Creatures affected by incendiary spit that take fire damage catch fire, taking 3d6 [[Persistent Damage]]. Once this persistent fire damage ends, the spit has burned away.

Squares the eberark moves through catch fire, creating a 5-foot-tall wall of flame that burns for 1 round. The wall of flame [[Concealed]] creatures and objects on the other side of it. Any creature that enters or starts its turn in the wall of flame takes 6d6 fire damage (DC 27 basic Reflex save).</span>
