# Crawling Slurry

Acid damage can scar stone and reduce flesh to pitted chunks, but some organic compounds are resistant to acid and respond by combining into a mass of roiling, living slurry. These scarred clumps hunger to consume anything they can sense. They move with quick, darting contractions that surprise those used to facing slow-moving oozes.

###  Accidental Oozes

Crawling slurries are almost always by-products of toxic waste or alchemical runoff into areas with a high concentration of acid, magic, or both. The first quickening pulses of animation in acid-pitted flesh are easy enough to end with counteracting chemicals or even isolation and starvation, but most crawling slurries are left to fester for a long time and become as large as a person. Left untended in a vat of nutritive acids and organic matter, a crawling slurry might become truly immense, but the power such a slithering horror holds is beyond comprehension.
