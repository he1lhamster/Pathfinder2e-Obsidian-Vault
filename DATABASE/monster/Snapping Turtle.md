# Snapping Turtle

Snapping turtles are freshwater reptiles with a long flexible neck, a sharp piercing beak, and a confrontational temperament that doesn't prevent some spellcasters from choosing these creatures as familiars. They weigh about 20 pounds and have shells around 18 inches in length.
