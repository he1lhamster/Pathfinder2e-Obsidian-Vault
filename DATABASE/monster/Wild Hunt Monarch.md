# Wild Hunt Monarch

Each wild hunt follows a wild hunt monarch, who travels between the realm of the fey and the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] in search of new quarry. These limber and regal humanoids have elk antlers, long pointed ears, flowing white hair, and luminescent green eyes.

**Greensight** The wild hunt monarch ignores the [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] condition from leaves and other foliage, mist, and fog.
**Planar Acclimation** The wild hunt monarch treats the plane it is located on as its home plane.
**Wild Hunt Link** (aura, divination, magical) 1 mile. A wild hunt monarch grants all other members of the wild hunt in the aura except wild hunt monarchs an increasesed range of wild hunt link to affect all wild hunt members within a mile. Other wild hunt creatures in this link who end their turn within 60 feet of a wild hunt monarch gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Regeneration|regeneration 50]] until the end of their next turn; this regeneration can only be deactivated by forcing the wild hunt out of the 60-foot aura or by killing the wild hunt monarch.
**Items** [[DATABASE/weapon/Glaive|monarch's glaive]], monarch's horn

Those who meet the gaze of a wild hunt monarch come face-to-face with the hunt's fearful power and find it difficult to act in the face of such a legendary legacy. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must succeed at a DC 39 Will save to resist becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] (slowed 2 on a critical failure). The wild hunt monarch can deactivate or activate this aura by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.</span>

This weapon functions as a _+3 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|major striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Thundering|greater thundering]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Wounding|wounding]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Glaive|glaive]]_ in the monarch's hands only. The monarch can call their glaive to their hands using this action, transporting it across any distance. If their glaive is destroyed, the monarch can create a new one by using Call Glaive as a three-action activity that gains the manipulate trait.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Call to the Hunt** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (conjuration, manipulate, primal, teleportation) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The wild hunt monarch blows their monarch's horn, causing two [[DATABASE/monster/Wild Hunt Scout|wild hunt scouts]] or four [[DATABASE/monster/Wild Hunt Archer|wild hunt archers]] part of the monarch's wild hunt link and no more than 1 mile from the monarch's location to appear as the monarch chooses at any point within 30 feet. They act immediately before the wild hunt monarch in initiative starting on the next round.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Focus Gaze** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual) The wild hunt monarch fixes its glare at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a Will save against the wild hunt monarch's wild gaze. If the creature was already [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] by the wild gaze before attempting its save, a failed save causes it to be [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to Focus Gaze from any wild hunt until the start of the wild hunt monarch's next turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wild Reincarnation** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (necromancy, primal) **Trigger** The wild hunt monarch kills an adjacent non-fey creature. **Effect** The wild hunt monarch attempts to reincarnate the creature as a fey. The slain creature must attempt a DC 42 Fortitude save, and it takes a –2 status penalty to this save if it was under any enchantment effect placed by the monarch when it died. 
**Critical Success** The creature is instead restored to life as if via [[DATABASE/spell/Raise Dead|raise dead]] (heightened to 10th level), and it is permanently immune to Wild Reincarnation from that wild hunt monarch. 
**Success** The creature is not reincarnated and remains dead. 
**Failure** The creature is temporarily reincarnated as a fey creature of the monarch's choice. The new fey must be of a level equal to or less than the dead creature's level, and it functions in all ways as that fey creature; it retains none of the abilities and only scatterings of the memories or personality of the reincarnated character, and it follows the commands and orders of the wild hunt monarch. After 1 minute, the reincarnated fey dies and its body reverts back to its original corpse, which can then be restored to life normally. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the reincarnated fey remains alive until slain; a [[DATABASE/spell/Miracle|miracle]], [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] or similarly powerful spell or effect can reverse the reincarnation as well.</span>
