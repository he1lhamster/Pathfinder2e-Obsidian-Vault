<span class="in-box-ability">**Rejuvenation** (divine, necromancy) When Bharlen is destroyed, her armor rebuilds her body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see [[DATABASE/monster/Graveknight|Graveknight Armor]]). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. Bharlen can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating her armor (such as with [[DATABASE/spell/Disintegrate|disintegrate]]), transporting it to the [[DATABASE/plane/Positive Energy Plane|Positive Energy Plane]], or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Sacrilegious Aura** (abjuration, aura, divine, evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a positive spell or ability, Bharlen automatically attempts to counteract it, with a +18 counteract modifier.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**No Escape <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** A creature within Bharlen's reach moves away from her; **Effect** Bharlen Strides up to her Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout this movement.</span>
