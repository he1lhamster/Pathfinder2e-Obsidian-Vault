# Zuishin

Zuishin are kami warriors and archers who task themselves with watching over important shrines, ancient gates, or sacred doorways. Monasteries secreted away in snowy valleys, pagodas hidden in remote forests, and archways that mark the passage into sacred hidden cities all might host such kami. With sturdy armor and hallowed armaments, zuishin fight tirelessly to drive off any evil powers who wish to desecrate their wards. Of all kami, zuishin most frequently fight against [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Oni|oni]], as the wards zuishin guard are most often targeted for desecration by these vile fiends.
 Most zuishin wear ancient armor and wield powerful weapons like swords and bows, but some might use spears, axes, or only their fists, depending on their ward and the people who make offerings there. Zuishin tend to regard mortals with skepticism. To earn a zuishin's trust, a supplicant might offer items of natural significance, such as an urn of hallowed earth, a branch from an ancient tree, or an arrangement of local flowers.
 Like all kami, a zuishin might come across as reserved or even indifferent to humans and their ilk; however, this impression stems only from a zuishin's wisdom and longevity, which makes mortal affairs seem relatively trivial. In the company of other kami, however, they're unerringly benevolent and readily offer their aid to their fellows. For example, a zuishin whose ward lies nestled in an ancient forest might readily join forces with [[DATABASE/monster/Kodama|kodama]] in those trees to deter foes.

**Ward** (abjuration, divine) Every kami is bound to a ward: a specific animal, plant, object, or location. A kami can merge with or emerge from their ward as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. While merged, the kami can observe their surroundings with their usual senses as well as the senses of their ward, but can't move, communicate with, or control their ward. Additionally, a kami merged with their ward recovers Hit Points each minute as if they spent an entire day resting.
 A zuishin's ward is a specific gate, doorway, or shrine.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Healing Arrow** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, healing, necromancy) The zuishin blesses an arrow with healing magic and makes a composite longbow Strike against an ally. If it hits, rather than dealing damage, the arrow is infused with the effects of one of the following of the zuishin's innate divine spells: [[DATABASE/spell/Breath of Life|breath of life]], [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]], [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Disease|remove disease]], or [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Paralysis|remove paralysis]]. The zuishin must have the spell available to cast, and using this ability expends the spell. If the zuishin rolls a failure on the attack roll against an ally who's aware of the arrow and wants to be hit, the attack hits, but on a critical failure, it still misses.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Holy Weaponry** (divine, enchantment, evocation, good) Any weapon becomes a _[[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]]_ _[[DATABASE/equipment/Holy|holy]]_ weapon while the zuishin wields it. A zuishin creates arrows out of nothing as part of their attacks with any bow they wield.</span>
