**Lazurite-Infused Flesh** Falrok's flesh is infused with lazurite, and he gains the benefits undead creatures gain from this mineral at all times. When in an area infused with lazurite, such as the Sanctum of the Starved, these benefits increase to a +3 circumstance bonus to saving throws against positive effects. This infusion also grants Falrok his resistance to positive damage.
