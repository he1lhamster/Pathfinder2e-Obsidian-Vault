# Baomal

Few sea monsters are as dreaded and feared as the two-headed baomal. These massive predatory beasts typically dwell in the deepest waters and compete with krakens and other monsters for food. They feed on whales and other large sea creatures, sometimes following them to the water’s surface. Near the surface, baomals that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty morsels. The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships’ hulls, then leisurely feed on the helpless sailors.

Creatures must succeed at a DC 42 [[Athletics]] check or be pulled up to 20 feet toward the baomal (40 feet on a critical failure). For ships, use the captain’s [[Lore]] in place of Athletics.

###  Mysterious Origins

All too often, those who study stranger monsters make the assumption that they were created by powerful but ill-advised wizards or are the result of ancient manipulations from the alghollthu empire. In the case of the baomal, extensive research suggests that neither of these explanations are accurate. No ancient texts have yet been recovered in which a wizard claims to have created the first baomal. And while the alghollthu of today use them as warbeasts, ancient carvings suggest that in the earliest days, baomals were ravenous hunters of alghollthus.
