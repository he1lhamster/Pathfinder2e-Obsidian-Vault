# Marrmora

On the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]], marrmoras dwell in ruined wildlands perpetually scourged by fire and rarely, if ever, travel elsewhere. When a wildfire devastates a wilderness region on the Material Plane and results in the death of other fey, marrmoras can be drawn across the planar boundary to revel in the resulting destruction. They seek to reignite the fires that beckoned them, to gather up and feed upon the charred remains of those who perished within (particularly the bodies of dead fey), though they do grow homesick if they spend too much time away from the First World. They are burdened by a capricious but persistent rage and are unfailingly cruel. While they are capable of negotiation and intelligent interaction, they almost never bargain in good faith and typically interact with others only as a means to more efficiently spread their fiery devastation.
 A marmorra's twisted appearance evokes the look of an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Arboreal|arboreal]] whose bark has been burnt down to charcoal. They have nearly featureless faces and hands ending in long, sharp claws. Their broken flesh looks like charcoal-burnt wood, riddled with cracks that still glow with an unwholesome heat. They trail ash wherever they walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies. Though marrmoras enjoy the sight of any woodland and its inhabitants roasting in the flames of their carefully curated fires, there is little that brings more pleasure to a marrmora than the sight of good-aligned plant creatures cooking to a crisp.

###  Fey Manipulators

Marrmoras exert a strange and subtle dominance over other fey. The fey under their control are filled with both horror at the destruction wrought by marrmoras and fascination with their fiery power.
