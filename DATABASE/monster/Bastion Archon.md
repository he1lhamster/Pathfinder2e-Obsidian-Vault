# Bastion Archon

The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of [[Lantern Archon]] converges into a gestalt in order to defend allies in a fight that seems all but lost, a fellow archon of significant strength—such as a [[Star Archon]]—can commit a brave act of self-sacrifice by dimensionally transposing itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just right and luck is with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacrifice, but instead the earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest of archons—the lanterns—can, in an instant, become their kind's greatest hope.
Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven's Holy Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of sacrifice, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested, and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness upon the surrounding region.

The ground in the affected area is also subjected to a level 10 [[Consecrate]] ritual, and the ground is consecrated for 10 years (or only 24 hours if the ultimate sacrifice took place in [[Hell]], [[Abaddon]], or the [[Abyss]]).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Retributive Strike]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** </span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Archon's Door** Once per day, if an archon sees another creature cast [[Dimension Door]], the archon can use dimension door (heightened to 5th level) within 1 round to attempt to follow that creature to the maximum distance of the archon's dimension door. If the archon's dimension door has enough distance, the archon appears the same distance and direction from the creature as before either creature used dimension door.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Blinding Beams** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Trigger **The bastion archon hits a creature with two fist Strikes this turn and can use its Holy Beam; **Effect **The bastion archon fires its Holy Beam at only the creature it hit twice.

While Entrenched, the archon can't be forcibly moved or tripped, and it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Entrench ends automatically as soon as the bastion archon uses another move action.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Holy Beam** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, good, incapacitation, light) The bastion archon releases a blinding beam of holy light in a 500-foot line that deals 20d6 good damage to non-archons in the area, with a DC 38 Reflex save. The bastion archon can't use Holy Beam again for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Success **The creature is unaffected. 
**Success **The creature takes half damage. 
**Failure **The creature takes full damage and is [[Blinded]] for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Failure **The creature takes double damage and is blinded permanently.</span>
