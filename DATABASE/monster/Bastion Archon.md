# Bastion Archon

The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of [[DATABASE/monster/Lantern Archon|lantern archons]] converges into a gestalt in order to defend allies in a fight that seems all but lost, a fellow archon of significant strength—such as a [[DATABASE/monster/Star Archon|star archon]]—can commit a brave act of self-sacrifice by dimensionally transposing itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just right and luck is with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacrifice, but instead the earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest of archons—the lanterns—can, in an instant, become their kind's greatest hope.
Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven's Holy Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of sacrifice, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested, and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness upon the surrounding region.
