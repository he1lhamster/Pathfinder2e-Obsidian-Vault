# Loblobi

In the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]], rivers don't always flow as expected; sometimes they run backward, upward, or just disappear into mist and reappear somewhere else entirely. Fey native to such rivers are often just as capricious. This quality is particularly true of loblobis, cunning carnivores who resemble small, chubby [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|humans]] with the heads and wings of crested herons.
 These malicious tricksters love playing any pranks that result in other creatures being embarrassed, hurt, or even drowned. Their most common “antic” is to cast _water walk_ on a hopeful river-crosser, only to dismiss the spell when their victim has traversed halfway across. Conversely, most loblobis are terrible sports when they're the butt of a joke. It's common wisdom that few creatures can hold a grudge like a loblobi.
 Exceptionally vain, loblobis flutter and dance constantly to show off their plumage. Failing to comment on a preening loblobi's appearance is a sure method to invite eternal enmity, but flattery might buy enough time to sneak away from the evil fey.

**Critical Failure** As failure. Additionally, while the creature is fascinated, any hostile actions from the loblobi don't break the fascination, but instead allow the target to attempt a new Will save to end the effect at the start of its next turn.</span>

###  Loblobi Dupes

Loblobis get along well with other river creatures who regularly flatter them and don't mind being the victims of the loblobi's inventive pranks. Since other loblobis rarely put up with this treatment, they don't often gather in groups. Loblobis particularly like to have companion creatures they find ugly, as they think it makes them look all the more regal by comparison. The one curious exception are [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Gremlin|gremlins]]; though loblobis hate gremlins' appearance, they don't want anything to do with gremlins, who they viciously drive away from their rivers and shores.
