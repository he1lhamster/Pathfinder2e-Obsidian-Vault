# Mist Stalker

The tentacled mist stalker shrouds itself in a cloak of mist through which its single, never-blinking eye can see with clarity, allowing it an advantage when stalking its prey.

**Mist Cloud** (aura, conjuration, primal, water) 15 feet. The mist stalker is surrounded by mist. Creatures in the aura are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]]. If wind disperses the aura, it returns automatically at the start of the mist stalker's turn. This cloud is suppressed in water.
**Mist Vision** The mist stalker ignores the [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] condition from mist and fog.
