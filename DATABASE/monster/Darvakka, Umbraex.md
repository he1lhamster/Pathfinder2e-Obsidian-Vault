# Darvakka, Umbraex

An umbraex appears at first glance to be a massive, majestic bird, much like a [[DATABASE/monster/Phoenix|phoenix]]. Instead of compassion and warmth, however, it seethes with cold and hate. The umbraex is among the largest of the nihilistic undead called darvakkas.

###  The Bound One

The secret of Yled's necromantic defenses is a group of darvakkas. The most powerful of these is a captive umbraex darvakka known only as “the Bound One.” Fortunately for life across the world, the Bound One is the only known umbraex on Golarion.
