# Grauladon

Grauladons are vicious predators that appear crocodilian in form, but are in fact distant offshoots of dragonkind. They make their dens in the shallows of fetid ponds or isolated corners of larger bodies of water, usually in rural swamps or woodlands. Driven almost entirely by their base desire to feed, grauladons spend most of their time swimming leisurely underwater looking for prey such as fish or waterfowl. Possessed of a greed befitting their more majestic dragon cousins, grauladons often take down prey larger than they need, jealously guarding the corpses to keep scavengers away even as the meat rots. A typical grauladon is 16 feet long from its snout to the tip of its tail and weighs 1,500 pounds.
 A grauladon’s stench may seem supernaturally disgusting, but it is simply the result of the creature’s fetid habitat and diet of rotting, waterlogged meat. As grauladons’ exhalations bear a passing resemblance to dragons’ breath, they have earned the nickname “mud drakes” from rural folk.
 Grauladons can be found in both fresh and brackish water in most temperate climates. They prefer to lair in shallow waters, particularly where reeds or other foliage conceal their bulk from unsuspecting prey. Grauladons are highly territorial and won’t tolerate other predators living or hunting near their homes.

###  Saltwater Grauladons

Although the vast majority of grauladons live in fresh or brackish waters, a rare grauladon species lives in and along saltwater coasts. These giant grauladons are even bigger than their common brethren, with stronger jaws and even danker breath. Rumors hint at the existence of truly massive saltwater grauladons capable of sinking ships. Most folk regard these stories as nothing more than tall tales, but plenty of eccentric old sailors and lighthouse operators readily attest otherwise, pointing to mysterious descriptions of shipwrecks in ancient logbooks and sometimes even showing their own scars as proof of the legends.
