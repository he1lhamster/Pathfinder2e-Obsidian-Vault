# Raven Swarm

A flock of ravens is known as an unkindness. Certainly the name lives up to its meaning when a swarm of ravens decides to work together. In most cases, a raven swarm like the one presented here won't attack larger foes, but when manipulated by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger, an unkindness of ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Enraged Cunning** There are few things as dangerously persistent in the natural world as an angry unkindness of ravens. A raven swarm can hound its prey through most barriers. Simple latches, unsecured chimney flues, loosely shuttered windows, and similar obstacles rarely keep an unkindness away. A raven swarm attempts a [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check to bypass many of these simple obstructions, typically against DC 20.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Swarming Beaks** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The ravens' angry pecking deals 1d8 piercing damage to each enemy in the swarm's space (DC 20 basic Reflex save). A creature that critically fails its save is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1d4 rounds as the ravens focus their attacks on the target's vulnerable face.</span>
