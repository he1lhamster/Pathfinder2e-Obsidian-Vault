description: "With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in\
  \ stony alcoves, rocky fissures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. The\
  \ strange little aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially\
  \ those that wander off from their packs or communities. A choker's long, spongy\
  \ arms are flexible but deceptively strong. The fingers can tighten rapidly and\
  \ are ridged with spiky, tooth-like structures that provide an incredible grip.\
  \ A choker typically strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers\
  \ it using crude tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered,\
  \ a choker tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away.\
  \ Chokers that encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture,\
  \ society, and the products of art and industry. This interest isn't very deep\u2014\
  it just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their\
  \ items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.<br/><br/>Chokers\
  \ sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned structures.\
  \ These chokers stalk at night, flopping across rooftops, tapping at windows, and\
  \ scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An urban choker\
  \ that finds prey early on its hunt\u2014a wandering pet, a person who is out alone\u2014\
  might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the products of\
  \ society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items, from tavern\
  \ signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one item at\
  \ a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to find a larger nest to accommodate\
  \ its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Choral (Choir Angel)

Choral angels are incredible singers who fill the halls of Nirvana with pious chants and sacred hymns. They form from the souls of talented bards and other performers. While they shy away from conflict, they occasionally brave the mortal realm to deliver good omens and auspicious messages. Choral angels often serve the goddess Shelyn, but they can also serve other good deities and empyreal lords.
