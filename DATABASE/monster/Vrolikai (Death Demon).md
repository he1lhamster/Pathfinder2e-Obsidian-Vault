# Vrolikai (Death Demon)

Unlike other demons, the dread vrolikai doesn't form from a sinful soul—they instead manifest from a [[DATABASE/monster/Nabasu (Gluttony Demon)|nabasu]] once the nabasu finally satisfies their hunger and returns to the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]], and as such vrolikais suffer from no vulnerability associated with a specific sin. A vrolikai who survives this process and the period of vulnerability that follows gains great power and in time can claim large regions of the Abyss as their own domain. Also known as death demons, these murderous monsters often serve demon lords as executioners or assassins.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Black Flame Knives** A vrolikai can manifest a dagger-shaped blade of what looks like crystallized black flame in each of their four hands. These weapons function as _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Dagger|daggers]]_, although they fade away into nothingness 1 minute after a vrolikai no longer carries them.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Consume Death** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, necromancy, visual) The vrolikai focuses their death-stealing gaze upon a single target they can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a Fortitude save against death-stealing gaze. 
**Success **The creature is unaffected. 
**Failure **The creature is affected by death-stealing gaze and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]]. If the creature was already drained 1 by the death-stealing gaze before attempting the save, a failed save increases the value of the drained condition by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. The vrolikai gains 10 temporary Hit Points, and the drained creature is temporarily immune until the start of the vrolikai's next turn. 
**Critical Failure **As failure, but the creature increases the amount of drain by 2.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Focused Flames** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The vrolikai attacks a single target with all of its black flame knives. The demon makes a black flame knife Strike. On a successful attack, the vrolikai deals the damage from a black flame knife Strike to the target, plus an additional 2d6 negative damage for every black flame knife they wield beyond the first (typically 6d6 extra damage). Even on a failed attack, the vrolikai deals the damage from one black flame knife to the target, though they still miss completely on a critical failure. On a critical hit, the victim becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]] as the focused attack drains pure life essence as well as damage. This counts toward the vrolikai's multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of black flame knives the demon wields.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Mindwarping** (emotion, enchantment, mental) The sting of a vrolikai is mind-warping. A creature struck must attempt a DC 44 Will save. 
**Critical Success **The creature is unaffected. 
**Success **The creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 minute. 
**Failure **The creature becomes stupefied 1. Further failed saves against mindwarping increase the condition value by 1, to a maximum of stupefied 4. 
**Critical Failure **As failure, but the creature also becomes confused for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Stolen Death** A creature that dies while suffering drain from a vrolikai's death-stealing gaze rises as a [[DATABASE/monster/Ghoul|ghoul]] the next midnight.</span>

###  Vrolikai Newcomers

When vrolikais first manifest on the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]], they have no base of power and are, despite their abilities, relatively defenseless from denizens even more powerful than themselves. As a result, most rely upon stealth and patience for their first few centuries while they build up a network of minions and establish their own Abyssal fortifications before they turn their attentions back to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]].
