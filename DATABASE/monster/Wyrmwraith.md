# Wyrmwraith

Though they refused to accept death, wyrmwraiths nonetheless despise their new undead condition. Indeed, lacking in all motivation to collect treasure, a wyrmwraith instead fixates on their hatred of all living things (especially dragons) and their own self-loathing. A wyrmwraith blights the land with their very presence, spreading slowly until their lair becomes a lifeless wasteland haunted by other undead.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, necromancy, negative) The wyrmwraith unleashes a burst of negative energy that deals 18d6 negative damage to all creatures in a 60-foot cone (DC 38 basic Reflex save).

Further damage dealt by the wyrmwraith's spectral jaws or spectral claws Strikes increases the value of the drained condition by 2 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ectoplasmic Form** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, necromancy) A wyrmwraith can push through the ectoplasmic veil to temporarily assume a physical form made of ectoplasm. The wyrmwraith loses the incorporeal trait for 1d4 rounds, though they can return to their incorporeal form as a free action before then. Once this ability ends, the wyrmwraith can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds. While in their ectoplasmic form, the wyrmwraith's AC increases to 43 and they gain 100 temporary Hit Points. They lose their immunity to precision damage and all of their resistances. Their melee Strikes deal slashing and piercing damage, respectively, instead of negative damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Phase Lurch** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, move) **Requirements** The wyrmwraith is in their ectoplasmic form; **Effect** As the Stride action, but the wyrmwraith can pass through walls or material obstacles as though they were incorporeal.
