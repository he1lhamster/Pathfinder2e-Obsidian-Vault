# Balisse (Confessor Angel)

Balisses, or confessor angels, seek to assist mortals ensnared by moral dilemmas or crises of faith. Balisses prefer to guide people to their own decisions rather than demand obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief is even more powerful than blind obedience. While most balisses are fundamentally honest, they use their guardian angel ability to seem less intimidating and decrease the chance the mortal will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously divine being. Balisses often form from souls of those who performed evil acts but were redeemed. Many serve the goddess Sarenrae, but they can serve other good deities and empyreal lords as well.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Brand of the Impenitent** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (curse, divine, evocation) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The balisse marks an evil creature within its confessor’s aura as irredeemable. It can only do so after a failed attempt to convince the creature to repent. The touched creature takes a –1 status penalty to AC and saves, reduces its resistances by 2, and gains weakness 2 to good damage. The duration depends on the target’s DC 26 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

When it does so, it merges with the mortal’s body and is unable to use any of its spells and abilities other than to interact with the mortal. It must use Guiding Angel again to leave the mortal. While merged with the mortal, the balisse can take a form of its choice that only the mortal can see, such as a small angel on the mortal’s shoulder. Alternatively, it can communicate with the mortal using a bodiless voice only the mortal can hear.</span>
