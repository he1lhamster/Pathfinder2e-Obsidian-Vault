# Muse Phantom

For performers who die before their time and whose love of the theater is stronger than death’s grasp, the show does indeed go on. Such actors rise from the grave to become muse phantoms—undead spirits that haunt opera houses or auditoriums and possess the bodies of living actors to continue their art.
 A host is often utterly unaware of being possessed by a muse phantom. Like egotistical parasites, muse phantoms assume command of their unwitting thespian shells only during big shows with packed audiences, and even then the host might chalk up their sudden lack of control to the transcendence of performance, not the nefarious influence of some paranormal entity. In time, a performer’s mind can become utterly warped by the spirit’s domination, twisting artistic temperament and vanity into evil selfishness and tireless obsession.

**Thespian Aura** (aura, emotion, mental, occult) 30 feet. The muse phantom inspires a supernatural emotional response—either comedy or drama. Each creature that begins its turn in the aura must attempt a DC 20 Will save; on a failure, the creature is affected as long as it remains within the aura. If the muse phantom is emitting a comedic aura, affected creatures become [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]]; if it is emitting a dramatic aura, affected creatures instead become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]].
 The muse phantom can change its aura from comedic to dramatic or vice-versa, or cease or activate this aura, by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait. A creature possessed by a muse phantom is immune to this aura.

###  Willing Hosts

Some actors who have felt the touch of a muse phantom come to relish and even desire the feeling of giving oneself over to what they consider a divine theatrical spirit. Such willing hosts voluntarily and routinely let themselves become possessed by a muse phantom, or even allow the spirit to reside within their body permanently. This symbiotic relationship allows the actor to advance their acting career and the phantom to continue performing to admiring masses.
