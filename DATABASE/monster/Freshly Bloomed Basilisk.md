<span class="in-box-ability">**Petrifying Glance** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (arcane, [[DATABASE/monsterability/Aura|aura]], transmutation, visual) **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet that the basilisk can see starts its turn. **Effect** The target must attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save.

That creature must attempt a DC 27 Fortitude save. If it fails and has not already been slowed by Petrifying Glance or this ability, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] 1. If the creature was already slowed by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a failed save causes the creature to be [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]] permanently. A creature petrified in this manner that is coated (not just splashed) with fresh basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk that has been dead no longer than 1 hour) is instantly restored to flesh. A single basilisk contains enough blood to coat 1d3 Medium creatures in this manner.</span>
