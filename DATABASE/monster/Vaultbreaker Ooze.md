# Vaultbreaker Ooze

Though many oozes hunt among the dreary confines of underground caverns, dungeons, and abandoned ruins, others seek to quell their hunger in areas well-trafficked by civilized creatures. The aptly named vaultbreaker oozes exhibit a mindless compulsion to feed on and digest precious metals. When near precious metals, the ichor exuded from their metallic plasm tarnishes black and forms small, jagged crystals that dot the oozes' surface. Like a strange biological compass, these crystals point vaultbreaker oozes to their next meal.
 Though mindless, these strange oozes exhibit an innate instinct for picking and bypassing locks to reach their meals by inserting a gelatinous pseudopod into a keyhole and then hardening the appendage into solid metal, forming a tool similar to a skeleton key.
 Vaultbreaker oozes can often be found in cities where tectonic instability has created fissures and cracks, allowing them to infiltrate basements, vaults, and underground chambers that may contain treasure. When rumors of vaultbreaker ooze sightings surface, banker consortiums, Abadaran priests, and even local thieves guilds offer hefty sums to have the dangerous oozes destroyed—though some might instead offer a bounty for their capture.

###  Tracking a Vaultbreaker Ooze

A vaultbreaker ooze that has recently fed on precious metals leaves behind a faint trail of smeared, molten leaf of what it ingested (often gold or silver). A character who succeeds at a DC 23 Perception check can detect the strange trail, though following the ooze using this residue requires a successful DC 26 [[Survival]] check to [[Track]]. A trail of metal leaf left by a vaultbreaker ooze flakes away after 1d4 days.
