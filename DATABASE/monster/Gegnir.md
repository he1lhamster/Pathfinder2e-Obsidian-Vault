**HP** 470, regeneration 40 (deactivated by acid or fire); **Weaknesses** fire 20
<span class="in-box-ability">**Head Regrowth** Gegnir has nine heads, and he can use regeneration to regrow a head that is severed from an effect like a [[DATABASE/equipment/Vorpal|vorpal]] weapon. After regaining Hit Points from regeneration, the jotund troll attempts a DC 8 flat check. On a success, one missing head is fully restored; on a critical success, two missing heads are fully restored. If Gegnir loses his last remaining head, he dies immediately.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Multiple Opportunities** A jotund troll gains an extra reaction per round for each of their heads beyond the first, which they can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity with their jaws or to Fast Swallow. They can't use more than 1 reaction for the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within their reach, and the jotund troll must use a different head for each Attack of Opportunity they make. Whenever one of Gegnir's heads is severed, he loses 1 of his extra reactions per round.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** </span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Catch Rock|Catch Rock]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** </span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Cacophonous Roar** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (auditory, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal) Gegnir emits a cacophonous roar from all his heads with a mystical power that distorts the listener's mind. Each non-troll creature within 100 feet must attempt a DC 42 Will save. Gegnir can't use Cacophonous Roar for 1d4 rounds.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Cacophonous Roar for 24 hours.
 **Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 round.
 **Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round.
 **Critical Failure** The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Fast Swallow** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Gegnir Grabs a creature with his jaws; **Effect** Gegnir uses [[DATABASE/monsterability/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Gut Tug** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Gegnir's intestines slither back into his body, pulling a creature [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] by his intestines toward himself. Gegnir rolls an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the creature's Fortitude DC. With a success, he pulls the creature into an adjacent space, and if he critically succeeds he can also make a jaws Strike against the creature after the pull.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Intestinal Tether** A creature hit by Gegnir's intestine becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]]. The creature isn't [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of Gegnir's intestine. A creature can sever the intestine with a successful Strike against AC 41 that deals at least 20 slashing damage. This deals no damage to Gegnir but prevents him from using his intestine Strike until he regrows his intestine, which takes 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ravenous Jaws** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Gegnir makes a number of jaws Strikes up to his number of heads, each against a different target. These attacks count toward the troll's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after he makes all of these attacks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Rend|Rend]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (attack) Medium, 4d12+10 bludgeoning, Rupture 40</span>
