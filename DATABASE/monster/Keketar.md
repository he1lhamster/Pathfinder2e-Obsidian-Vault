# Keketar

The ruling caste of the proteans, keketars orchestrate attacks against the bastions of law and adjudicate protean disputes confidently and capriciously. A keketar resembles a shimmering, serpentine creature with spines, claws, and a dragon-like head. A keketar’s actual appearance is in constant flux, but they generally stay about 18 feet long with a weight of around 1,500 pounds. While their physical forms can vary, two things remain constant: First, a keketar’s eyes are always a piercing shade of amber or violet. Second, the keketar’s mark of office—a crown of shifting symbols that hovers above its head—never changes. A keketar cannot remove its crown but can suppress it, although most are loath to do so and consider such an act one of cowardice or shame.
 Keketars fill a role in protean society of a sort of priesthood, operating as intermediaries between the other proteans and the Speakers of the Depths. All other proteans defer to keketars, treating them in a way similar to how citizens of a mortal city would treat respected nobles; even more powerful proteans defer to the will of the keketars. As with many religions, dogma and theology are prone to interpretation and change, and among the proteans the situation is perhaps even more pronounced. Whatever the nature of and desires held by the mysterious Speakers of the Depths, individual keketars may come to dramatically different conclusions as to their will and intent. To the proteans, though, this inherent dissonance is a strength rather than a weakness.

**Entropy Sense** (divination, divine, prediction) A keketar can anticipate the most likely presence of a creature through a supernatural insight into chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants it the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[Nondetection]] or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Protean Anatomy** (divine, transmutation) A keketar’s vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the keketar takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> The keketar is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If blinded or deafened, the keketar automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Spatial Riptide** (aura, divine, transmutation) 30 feet. A creature using a teleportation ability within the aura or arriving in it via teleportation must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save or wink out of existence for 1d4 rounds before completing the teleport. The creature can’t act, sense anything, or be targeted. On a successful save, the creature completes the teleport normally but is stunned 1. Keketars are immune to this effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Attack of Opportunity** <span class="action-icon">5</span> </span>
