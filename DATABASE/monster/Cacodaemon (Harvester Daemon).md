description: 'The bythos is a guardian of space and time, and at all times seeks out
  those who misuse planar and temporal magic. A bythos is a roughly humanoid creature
  with four arms and a body made of swirling clouds and mist. Despite its appearance,
  its body feels like dry stone. A bythos seeks out paradoxes caused by irresponsible
  planar or dimensional travelers and repairs breaches where the barriers between
  planes have become thin or damaged. If the mortals responsible remain in the area
  and cannot be convinced to cease their activities, the bythos has no qualms about
  removing them. Using its ability to manipulate time, a bythos might cause an opponent
  to quickly die of old age as time speeds up around them, or cause a target to disappear
  from time and space.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Monitor</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]]

# Cacodaemon (Harvester Daemon)

These embodiments of demented violence and spite are spawned from eddies of angry and warped souls amid Abaddon’s mists. Cacodaemons constantly hunger for mortal souls and yearn to create suffering. As gnashing spheres of teeth, fins, and spines, they are the weakest of daemonkind, an amalgam of various petty forms of death without the strength that comes from focusing on a single cause of demise.

</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Soul Lock** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (death, divine, necromancy) Once per day, a cacodaemon can ingest the soul of a sentient creature within 30 feet that died within the last minute. When it does, the cacodaemon grows a fist-sized soul gem (Hardness 2, HP 8) in its gut and can regurgitate it at any time as an Interact action. Destroying the gem frees the soul within but does not return the deceased creature to life. The caster of a spell to return a creature to life whose soul is trapped within a soul gem must succeed at a DC 30 Religion check. On a success, the soul gem shatters and the creature is returned to life as normal for the spell.
 By using an Interact action, a fiend can ingest a soul gem it is holding, condemning the soul to the fiend’s home plane. The fiend gains fast healing 5 for 1 minute.</span>
