# Storm Giant

Storm giants are looming but benevolent stewards of sea and sky, often serving as the natural guardians of tropical islands, coastlines, or rocky archipelagos. Storm giants tend to rapidly shift in mood and behavior, one moment engaging in peaceful negotiation, the next unleashing unbridled ferocity against their foes. In this way, they embody both the fury of a raging tempest and the calm of a hurricane’s eye. This can make them valuable allies who race to the aid of those in need, but their allies remain must be alert and mindful of their mood, as the giants can be quick to anger or aggressive when caution is most appropriate.
 Most storm giants have complexions akin to the crystal blue of the ocean or the warm violet of a sky touched by the setting sun. Their hair tends to be dark purple, blue, or black, and their eyes often have a silvery sheen. A typical storm giant stands 21 feet tall, weighs 12,000 pounds, and lives to be about 600 years old.
