# Grand Defender

Hand-carved by the Father of Creation himself and strengthened by the souls of history's most heroic dwarves, the Grand Defender serves as [[DATABASE/deity/Torag|Torag's]] herald across the planes. While a true messenger of a deity, the Grand Defender manifests itself in a unique way to other heralds. The chassis of the Grand Defender exists within Forgeheart, Torag's subterranean realm in [[DATABASE/plane/Heaven|Heaven]]. This frame is empty, however, and can only serve basic functions, much like a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Golem|golem]]. When faithful call upon the Grand Defender, Torag rouses the construct with spirits. As the might of the Grand Defender comes from Torag's will and the power of the souls within, the Grand Defender can take on any number of forms. Torag can send these spirits to alter any sufficiently sized statue of a dwarven ancestor. This process temporarily converts the carving into the Grand Defender itself, complete with its abilities and equipment.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Hammer Storm** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, earth, evocation) The Grand Defender unleashes a volley of warhammers that deal 12d8 bludgeoning damage in a 50-foot cone (DC 36 basic Reflex save). The Grand Defender can exclude any number of squares from the cone's area, preventing damage to creatures in those squares. Creatures that critically fail their save are pushed 10 feet away from the Grand Defender and knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. The storm creates 24 Medium [[DATABASE/weapon/Warhammer|warhammers]] that persist after the attack and can be used by creatures. The Grand Defender can't use Hammer Storm for 1d4 rounds.</span>

###  Highhelm Statues

As the pinnacle of [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarven]] civilization for centuries, the Sky Citadel of Highhelm has endured many invasions. To cement their safety as [[DATABASE/deity/Torag|Torag's]] chosen people, the dwarves have erected dozens of statues befitting the manifestation of the Grand Defender. The most famous of these is a colossal likeness of Taargick, the King of the Sky. Weathered and damaged beyond repair after a half dozen battles in which the Grand Defender protected the city, it now stands where the herald last left it, gazing over Stonebreach.
