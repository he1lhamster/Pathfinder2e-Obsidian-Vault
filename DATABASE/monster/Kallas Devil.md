# Kallas Devil

Bearing a resemblance to the flayed [[DATABASE/monster/Nuckelavee|nuckelavee]] that lurks in stagnant swamps, the Kallas Devil distinguishes herself by being able to separate herself from her mount without issue, as well as with her powers of disguise and subtlety. Though her wicked trident and violent fury are enough to sear her image into the minds of the local people, it's the Kallas Devil's ability to slip unseen among her would-be victims that elevates the creature beyond the ranks of a common horror. No matter how careful the residents of Riverton are with their youth and the vulnerable, the Kallas Devil claims her chosen target more often than not, luring the hapless victim toward doom while wearing a smiling child's face.

**Leatherwork** Once a month, the Kallas Devil can spend 1 day stitching the skin of a person into her coat. This gives her skinned cloak a +1 circumstance bonus to her AC for one week.
**Skinned Steed** The Kallas Devil has a horse minion known as the Skinned Steed. The horse has a swim speed equal to its standard Speed and the minion trait, and it's under the control of the Kallas Devil. The Kallas Devil automatically succeeds at all checks to [[DATABASE/action/Command an Animal|Command ]] the Skinned Steed. While mounted on the Skinned Steed, the Kallas Devil fuses with the horse, causing the two to become a single being. The Skinned Steed doesn't act on its own while fused with the Kallas Devil, instead acting as the Devil's legs to move around the battlefield. The Kallas Devil doesn't command the Skinned Steed in this state and instead replaces her Speeds with the mount's speeds until she dismounts. While the two are separated, the Kallas Devil needs to Command the Steed, as normal. If the Skinned Steed is killed, the Kallas Devil can replace it by spending 1 day to prepare another horse, converting it into her new Skinned Steed.

### Alternative Abilities

Rumors run rampant about the most mysterious and unique beings on Golarion, and any scholar who makes assumptions can easily be blindsided by reality. As the Kallas Devil takes the skin of others, she sometimes gains different abilities due to the differing natures of the souls she claims. GMs choosing to use one of these abilities can replace one of the Kallas Devil's abilities in the stat block on page 46. A GM can add two of these abilities and apply the elite adjustment to create a more powerful version of the Kallas Devil, perhaps one that has been empowered by a killing spree.
 **Blameless** While in disguise, the Kallas Devil can attempt to keep others from noticing her Loathsome Stench by attempting a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]]. She has a +4 circumstance bonus to this check.
 **Infectious Water** The Kallas Devil has a vengeful streak and has the ability to infect wells and water supplies in Riverton with [[DATABASE/disease/Sewer Haze|sewer haze]]. She can infect the water supply 1d6 days after the Festival of the Skinned Hooves if the ritual sacrifice of the festival isn't performed.
 **Underwater Views** While underwater, the Kallas Devil can blend in with the surrounding environment and hide from other creatures by attempting a [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check. She has a +4 circumstance bonus for this check.
 **Cold Currents** While the Kallas Devil is in water, she gains cold resistance 10 and electricity weakness 5.
 **Suffer the Children** (aura, charm, emotion, mental) 20 feet. While the Kallas Devil is disguised as a child, any creature in the aura who is considered an adult by their culture takes a –2 circumstance penalty to checks and DCs opposing the Kallas Devil's Deception.
 **Freezing Touch** When winter comes to Riverton, the Kallas Devil sharpens her claws with chunks of ice. When the Kallas Devil makes a jaws or claw attack, she deals an additional 1d6 cold damage.
 **Waterfall Torrent** The Kallas Devil controls any water she touches. When the Kallas Devil is in water, she can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Hydraulic Push|hydraulic push]] as an occult innate spell at will.

### The Skinned Steed

As the Kallas Devil constantly replaces her mount with the latest offering from the locals, the Skinned Steed doesn't have a specific stat block. Instead, the Skinned Steed can have whatever statistics you need for the story you wish to tell or combat you wish to run. The Skinned Steed should be weaker than the Kallas Devil herself and, at most, should be a 7th-level creature. Assume the typical Skinned Steed is a [[DATABASE/monster/War Horse|war horse]] with the elite adjustment.
