# Munagola (Executioner Devil)

Munagolas are some of the most feared demonic warriors in Hell, combining the aerial strength and craftiness of erinyes with sheer brute force rivaling that of the strongest devils.

###  Defying Limiation

While Dis is a city of unyielding order and unforgiving law, the Queen of the Night [[DATABASE/deity/Eiseth|Eiseth]] operates outside of the established diabolical hierarchy. Despite her stronghold being located within the Infernal City, her army of [[DATABASE/monster/Erinys (Fury Devil)|erinyes]], commanded by the fierce and brutal munagolas, answer only to her. They strike her enemies without mercy or restraint, even in open defiance of [[DATABASE/deity/Dispater|Dispater]] if it suits their queen.
