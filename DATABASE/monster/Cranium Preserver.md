# Cranium Preserver

Cranium preservers serve necromancers as walking laboratories for undead. A typical cranium preserver has a metallic and spider-like body, which holds aloft a large central glass vat surrounded by a dozen or more smaller, head-sized glass vats. Each vat is filled with a special embalming fluid that can preserve the minds of slain enemies.

**Undead Crafter** The cranium preserver knows one version of the [[DATABASE/ritual/Create Undead|create undead]] ritual for every four heads it has preserved (a typical cranium preserver has 12 preserved heads). The cranium preserver can use its heads to make separate rolls as both the primary and secondary casters of the ritual.

###  Amalgamated Personality

A cranium preserver has its own independent personality that is derived from the amalgamated thoughts of the preserved heads it collected. These heads are subservient to the cranium preserver's overriding will, but swapping out preserved heads seems to affect the creature's desires. Some cranium preservers stocked with heads from good-hearted individuals even have moments where they appear to show remorse for their vile deeds.
