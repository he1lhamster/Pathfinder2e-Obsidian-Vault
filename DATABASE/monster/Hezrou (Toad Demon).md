# Hezrou (Toad Demon)

Hezrous dwell in the vast and endless Abyssal swamps, mires, and waterways and are equally at home on land and in the water. A hezrou's presence has an obvious effect on nearby flora and water, causing plant life to twist and knot and infusing water with a foul odor and brackish taste—signs much easier to spot on the Material Plane than in the Abyss. Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities of corrupted creatures sometimes rise in swamplands where a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures, and they often waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable places to slumber, squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They do not seek out cults to fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to worship on their own. Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted their environs or neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region or the insidious spread of drugs and poisons through a society.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Purity Vulnerability** A hezrou revels in the foulness it exudes and becomes distraught when contaminations are purified. The first time in a round when a contamination is purified (such as via [[DATABASE/spell/Purify Food and Drink|purify food and drink]]) or a toxin is neutralized (such as via [[DATABASE/spell/Neutralize Poison|neutralize poison]]) within 30 feet of a hezrou, the demon takes 6d6 mental damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Stench** (aura, olfactory) 30 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (plus [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</span>
