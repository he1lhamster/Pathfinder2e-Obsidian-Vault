description: 'Hesperides are nymphs of sunset, guardians of the colorful golden hues
  of the setting sun. They live on remote islands, isolated coastal cliffsides, and
  hidden valleys, all places where the sunset''s golden glow can have the strongest
  effect. Hesperides manipulate sunlight with dancelike motions, allowing them to
  create graceful ribbons of light at close range and searing rays at a distance.
  Due to their connection to the beauty of the daily cycle of the setting sun, hesperides
  feel a satisfaction from methodical routine that can feel alien to wilder, more
  chaotic fey. <br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Fey</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]]

# Hezrou (Toad Demon)

Hezrous dwell in the vast and endless Abyssal swamps, mires, and waterways and are equally at home on land and in the water. A hezrou's presence has an obvious effect on nearby flora and water, causing plant life to twist and knot and infusing water with a foul odor and brackish taste—signs much easier to spot on the Material Plane than in the Abyss. Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities of corrupted creatures sometimes rise in swamplands where a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures, and they often waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable places to slumber, squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They do not seek out cults to fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to worship on their own. Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted their environs or neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region or the insidious spread of drugs and poisons through a society.
