# Necrohusk

Necrohusks are skittering, undead monstrosities, created when a humanoid is purposefully twisted into a new creature through necromantic experimentation. Unlike fleshwarps and recipients of successful necrografts, prospective necrohusks never survive the procedure. After reanimation, they're cunning, animalistic creatures that follow their creator's orders without question. 
Creating a necrohusk is an incredibly difficult endeavor, fraught with error. Most attempts result in lumps of useless, rotten slurry or malformed undead no more cunning or dangerous than a mundane zombie. The costs in time, experimental subjects, and expensive spell components lead some would-be necromancers to conclude that the results aren't worth the risk. Occasionally, spellcasters can harness the power of the Negative Energy Plane during the process, which lessens the monetary cost but vastly increases the danger, often producing a deadly backlash resulting in the creator's death and a masterless necrohusk. 
Among the Sutaki, only Ashen Swale and his lieutenants, Turkek and Azi, have the skill and knowledge to create necrohusks with any regularity, although Turkek's interests often lead him away from such gruesome endeavors. Necrohusks are created from volunteers in Ashen Swale's cult or from traitorous Sutaki whom Ashen Swale wants to punish with a ghastly fate.

###  Further Experimentation

Necrohusks range from Small to Large and often have alternative methods of locomotion and additional abilities. Suitable abilities from other undead creatures include bleeding and fiendish from [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Beheaded|beheaded]], bloody and explosive death from [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Skeleton|skeletons]], and feast and rotting aura from [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Zombie|zombies]]. A necrohusk with additional abilities should be higher level than one without. Use the guidelines in Chapter 2 of the Gamemastery Guide to determine its new statistics.
