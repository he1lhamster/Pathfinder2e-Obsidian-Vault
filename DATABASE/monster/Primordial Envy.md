# Primordial Envy

The primordial envy is most often found in underground ruins within Edasseril. It hungers for magic, leaching it from any source it can come into contact with. This hunger can be exploited by clever adventurers who bait it with powerful destructive magics. A primordial envy is one of the most defensive sin oozes, and it tends to layer abjuration spells over itself to both increase its resilience and empower its attacks.

The spellcasting creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Spell Drain for 24 hours.
 **Success** The creature takes 1d6 mental damage.
 **Failure** The creature takes 2d6 mental damage and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 hour.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but one of the creature's uncast spells or unused spell slots is lost, as if they had cast it. The spell or slot lost is one of the highest-level spells the creature can cast, determined randomly if multiple prepared spells are available. If a cantrip is drained, the spellcaster loses access to that cantrip for 10 minutes. The primordial envy becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened 1]] for 1 round, and can use the extra action to Stride or Strike.</span>
