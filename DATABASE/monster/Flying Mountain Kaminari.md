The kaminari unleashes four 20-foot bursts within 60 feet with the effects of a 9th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Wind|wall of wind]]. In addition, a creature that enters one of the bursts takes 6d6 slashing damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save). The bursts can't overlap. After using this activity the kaminari can't use Hurricane Bag for 1d4 rounds. 
If a kaminari creates a column of lighting using Thunder Drums that intersects one of the areas of the wind, the wind explodes in a peal of thunder, dealing 6d10 sonic damage to creatures in the area of that wall of wind burst. Affected creatures must attempt a DC 40 Fortitude save. The kaminari can detonate only one burst per use of Thunder Drums. 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Success** The target takes half damage. 
**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] for 1 minute. 
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is deafened permanently.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Stormflight** A kaminari can move in wind with ease.

The kaminari establishes a connection with another kaminari within 150 feet, and lightning and thunder form a line between the centers of their spaces. For the next minute, a creature that begins its turn in the line or enters the line on its turn takes 4d12 electricity damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save). A creature can take this damage only once per round, even if it moves through several tempest tethers. If the distance between the kaminari ever exceeds 150 feet, the tether breaks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Thunder Drums** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (electricity) The peal of a kaminari's drums bring thunder and lightning. The kaminari summons four 100-foot-tall columns of lightning to strike in 5-foot bursts within 60 feet. These columns can't overlap. Creatures in the burst take 8d12 electricity damage and must attempt a DC 40 Reflex save. The kaminari can't use Thunder Drums again for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The target takes half damage. 
**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]]. 
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is stunned 2.</span>
