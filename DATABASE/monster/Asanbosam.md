# Asanbosam

Asanbosams are monstrous, hairy humanoids with [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron|cold iron]] fangs and muscular limbs that end in powerful, hooked claws. They hang in treetops from their hooked feet, waiting patiently for a creature to pass by below. Asanbosams grab their prey from above, latching onto their unfortunate victims' necks to drain their blood. They react to perceived intrusions with belligerence, stalking visitors from high branches. Locals tell horror stories of these “bloodsucking tree-folk,” and experienced explorers keep a close watch on the treetops in asanbosam territory. Visitors to the Expanse often compare asanbosams to vampires, but these horrors aren't undead and bear no relation.
 An asanbosam's diet calls for a large amount of iron (typically in the form of blood) to maintain the integrity of its oversized cold iron teeth. When not hunting or mating, an asanbosam spends its waking hours chewing on certain types of rocks to sharpen its teeth.
 Some folk tales claim that asanbosams are as old as time and the original source of cold iron, and that veins of the metal found in the ground are truly the graveyards of ancient asanbosams. Brave (or foolish) poachers often infiltrate asanbosam territory to hunt these monsters in the hope of collecting sacks of their valuable teeth.

On a hit, the Strike deals an additional 1d6 slashing damage and the asanbosam immediately [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grabs]] the target and pulls it to a space adjacent to the asanbosam. This counts as two attacks for the asanbosam's multiple attack penalty.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drink Blood** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** A [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or willing creature is within reach of the asanbosam's jaws; **Effect** The asanbosam sinks its teeth into the creature to drink its blood. If the victim is grabbed, this is automatic; otherwise, the asanbosam must succeed at an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC. The victim becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] and the asanbosam regains 10 HP, gaining any excess Hit Points beyond its maximum as temporary Hit Points. These temporary Hit Points remain for 1 minute. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained increases the victim's drained value by 1 to a maximum of drained 3, but doesn't restore any HP to the asanbosam.
 A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 each week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check and a blood donor or sufficient blood, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.</span>

###  Asanbosam Treasure

The corpse of a dead asanbosam is a treasure in itself. Extracting the creature's [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron|cold iron]] fangs is no easy process and requires either powerful extraction tools or a vat of chemicals to melt the surrounding bone tissue. The payoff, however, can be substantial in the right market.
