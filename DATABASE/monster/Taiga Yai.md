# Taiga Yai

Wearing the visage of [[DATABASE/monster/Taiga Giant|taiga giants]], taiga yais generally travel in a solitary fashion, always yearning for new experiences and destinations. They are zealous in their love of nature in its purest form and gleefully destroy any established civilizations that they encounter before continuing onwards.

###  Oni loners

More so than other oni, taiga yais prefer seclusion or the company of evil beasts and wicked fey over that of other humanoids. They often befriend carnivorous animals, frequently partnering with apex predators such as bears and lions.
