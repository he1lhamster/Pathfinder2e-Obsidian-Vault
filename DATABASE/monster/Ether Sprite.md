###  Sprite Collections

Ether sprites have a reputation for being thieves. In truth, they're generally curious about the world and simply have a tendency to walk away with objects that don't belong to them, not understanding the concept of ownership. As a result, ether sprites tend to have small interesting objects in their possession, such as talismans or gemstones.
