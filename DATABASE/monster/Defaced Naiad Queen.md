**Shame** A defaced naiad queen suffers from shame (see below) when it attacks any target that can cast primal spells, any fey creature, or any creature that can cast divine spells and worships a deity or faith associated with nature or the First World (such as Gozreh, one of the Eldest, or the Green Faith). Forgive Foe can be attempted against a defaced naiad queen with a DC 36 Diplomacy check or Nature check. If a defaced naiad queen is affected by a critical success from Forgive Foe, its eyes are restored and it cries out in relief an instant before it vanishes, returning to the First World as a chaotic neutral naiad queen. As it does so, a wave of emotional thanks and inspiration infuse the character who used Forgive Foe, granting them a +3 status bonus to Lore checks and saves against fear effects for 24 hours.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Agonized Wail** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, primal) The defaced naiad queen unleashes an agonized wail. Each creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] 1 (or, on a critical failure, frightened 2 and [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] until the end of its next turn).

On a failure, it is affected as if by nymph's tragedy; if it was already affected by that aura, it also takes 8d6 mental damage (16d6 on a critical failure). A defaced naiad queen can use Baleful Gaze on a given creature only once per turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tortuous Touch** <span class="action-icon">1</span> A creature struck by the defaced naiad queen's painful caress Strike must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save. On a failure, painful, jagged wounds open on the creature's body, the pain of which makes it [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy]] 1 (clumsy 2 and fall [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] on a critical failure). The clumsy condition is permanent until it is removed via an effect like [[DATABASE/spell/Restoration|restoration]].</span>

### The Power of Forgiveness

Some of the creatures in the House at the Edge of Time—the ghostly guards and defaced naiad queens, but most notably Nyrissa herself—still harbor vestiges of goodness in their minds and souls that can be appealed to by PCs who seek to forgive them for their actions. A PC can learn about the Forgive Foe action accidentally if they seek to appeal to a creature in the House at the Edge of Time in this way on their own, or they can learn about it by closely observing how certain creatures act when they attack certain foes.
 These foes have a Shame entry in their stat block. When such a foe attacks specific targets delineated in their Shame entry, they suffer a –2 status penalty on attack rolls and to all save DCs to resist their spells or attacks. Whenever such a creature takes an action that triggers this penalty, all creatures within 30 feet can attempt a Perception check against the acting creature's Deception DC. On a success, the creature attempting the check realizes the creature taking the action is suffering from guilt and shame at their own action; this reveals that a Forgive Foe action might help the acting creature recover from its plight.

---
You make an attempt to force a foe to confront its guilt and face its shame for its actions. When you do so, attempt either a Diplomacy check or another check as indicated in the creature’s Shame entry; the DC is the creature’s Will DC.
**Critical Success** Your words strike home and allow the creature to escape its servitude to the House at the Edge of Time. The specific effects of this are listed in the creature’s Shame entry.
**Success** Your words give the foe pause. It suffers a –2 status penalty on all attacks, effect DCs, and its Will DC against additional Forgive Foe attempts until the end of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt fails so dramatically that you instead fuel the creature’s wrath and effectively blind it to its sense of shame and guilt. For the next 24 hours, it no longer suffers the effects of shame when it attacks you and you can no longer attempt to Forgive that Foe.
