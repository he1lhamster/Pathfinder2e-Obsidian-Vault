# Meladaemon (Famine Daemon)

Meladaemons personify death by starvation and thirst, and revel in spreading the same despair that brought about their mortal demise. When they aren't blighting fields, massacring livestock, or tainting water supplies, they experiment on prisoners to study how long creatures can go without sustenance and the deleterious effects that result from such deprivation. Fiercely loyal to Trelmarixian, Horseman of Famine, they serve no other beings. They work alongside other daemons if Trelmarixian wills it, but are notoriously traitorous.
