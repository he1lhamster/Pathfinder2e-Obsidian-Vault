# Intellect Assemblage

Intellect assemblages are artificial constructs created from the memories of others. These memories are solidified into jagged shards similar in appearance to shattered glass and fused together in vaguely humanoid-shaped clusters to create the assemblage's body. The resulting construct is incredibly intelligent but completely devoid of emotion, possessing the thoughts and memories of a multitude but no personal connection to any of them. Analytical and meticulous, intellect assemblages view the world and everything in it as parts of a complex equation or system. They place no value on life or morality and consider emotions an illogical weakness.

**Thoughtsense** (divination, mental, occult) The intellect assemblage senses all non-mindless creatures at the listed range.

###  The Flawed

Very rarely, intellect assemblages are created incidentally, usually in the aftermath of tragic accidents or catastrophes that result in the sudden and instantaneous death of numerous intelligent beings. The resulting intellect assemblages, often called “the Flawed” by their fellows, are capable of being emotional, compassionate, and introspective.
