# Blackfrost Prophet

With their hulking physiques and the potent connection to the Crown of the World, saumen kar who succumb to blackfrost become especially dangerous blackfrost dead. Those who guarded the Temple of Aqakaru in life continue to do so in undeath, albeit even more vigilantly and much more violently. Blackfrost prophets, as these wardens are sometimes known, maintain their formidable intellect and innate connection to their boreal environment, though the curse of blackfrost has stripped them of their memories and filled their hearts with evil.
