# Gashadokuro

The dreaded gashadokuro is an undead haunter of the night, spawning as a giant skeleton that rises from the earth in the aftermath of a mass starvation event. These enormous creatures then seek to inflict their unending hunger on the living.
 A gashadokuro that comes about due to a poor growing season is more prone to stalk remote village farmlands at night, while a gashadokuro that arose from the victims of a government-instigated food shortage has few compunctions about stomping straight into bustling cities in broad daylight. These latter gashadokuro even seem to target aristocrats and government authorities—whether or not they were the same politicians whose negligence resulted in the famine in the first place—leading many to believe that the gashadokuro seeks to slake its thirst for revenge even more than it seeks to sate its unending hunger.

###  Nocturnal Terrors

The gashadokuro hunts for victims mainly after dusk, especially in the hour just after midnight. In parts of Tian Xia, particularly in the tumultuous regions of war and famine following the collapse of Imperial Lung Wa, parents hush their hungry children to sleep by warning that nighttime cravings will cause a gashadokuro to visit the household.
