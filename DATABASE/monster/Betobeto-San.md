# Betobeto-San

A betobeto-san wanders the highways and byways of the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], searching for unwilling traveling companions to sustain the spirit's appetite for fear. Though this shadow spirit is invisible in darkness or shade, in light they appear as a formless, shadowy mass with two sandaled feet. These sandals are made of wood or bone that cause the creature's footsteps to make the distinct “beto beto” sound from which they receive their name. A wide, toothy mouth smiles in the middle of their otherwise featureless mass, and they can manifest long, clawed limbs.
 Betobeto-san trail behind nighttime travelers, compelled to follow until the creatures verbally offer to let the betobeto-san pass. This compulsion isn't usually malicious by nature and occurs more from a betobeto-san's misguided desire for company and courtesy; unfortunately, they lack of understanding how this behavior can frighten others. Betobeto-san don't attack those they follow, but they often end up in combat because their unwelcome behavior causes those they follow to attack first.

These decoys act independently on the betobeto-san's initiative with 2 actions apiece. They can only [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]] or Stride, and they have a Speed of 35 feet. Use the betobeto-san's [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] DC (typically 37) against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] or disbelieve a decoy. Each decoy lasts for 1 minute. Any existing decoys vanish if the betobeto-san uses this ability again.</span>

###  Shadowy Afterimages

Betobeto-san are the afterimages of travelers that passed between the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow]] and [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Planes]]. While few such journeys create betobeto-san, sages posit that certain emotions or intents from those who travel between these planes can create these apparitions during the transit.
