# I'iko Dragon

I'iko dragons are greedy bullies with long muscular bodies, stubby legs, small wings, and shimmering glass-like scales. From their treetop nests overhanging well-traveled rivers, i'iko dragons land on passing watercrafts and extort the passengers, threatening to capsize boats if not paid with bright treasure. When faced with a well-armed group guarding their desired trinkets, they instead resort to stealth, stealing them under cover of darkness, using their claws to pick locks and disable traps as needed.
 I'iko dragons reside in the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, particularly in Nantambu where they live under the tall arching bridges that cross the city's many canals, building roosts in the bridge supports. I'iko dragons eat fish and birds, and have a taste for glass, crystals, and gemstones, which they consume to harden and color their scales. Incredibly vain, i'iko dragons collect the most colorful glass they can find to transform their scales into a resplendent rainbow.

###  I'iko Dragon Hoards

I'iko dragons hoard small, easily transportable baubles in their nests, particularly magical trinkets and any objects incorporating glass, crystals, and gemstones—though these objects rarely remain whole long, as the dragons devour the most colorful components, leaving gemless rings and glassless mirrors.
