# Xilvirek

Xilvireks are the result of the strange evolution that takes place in [[Zevgavizeb]] Abyssal realm. These fiends resemble their dread demon lord and claim to be living embodiments of the Lord of Reptiles’s snapping jaws.
**Recall Knowledge - Fiend ([[Religion]])**: DC 32
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 30
**Specific Lore**: DC 27

<span class="in-box-ability">**Disgorge Bile** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (acid, inhaled) The xilvirek retches a small pool of debilitating, acrid bile onto itself. All creatures within 30 feet take 4d6 acid damage as they inhale the bile’s noxious fumes (DC 32 basic Fortitude save; on a failure, the creature is [[Sickened]], or sickened 2 on a critical failure). The xilvirek can’t Disgorge Bile again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Feasting Tentacles** The xilvirek has two tentacles on its back that it can use to suck the life from its prey. A creature that starts its turn grabbed by the xilvirek becomes [[Drained]], and the xilvirek regains 20 HP. The drained value increases by 1 on each subsequent round that the creature starts its turn grabbed, but the xilvirek doesn’t regain additional HP from draining the same creature more than once per day.</span>

###  Xilvereks on the Material Plane

Despite their origins within Gluttondark, xilvireks have been encountered with increasing frequency in the deepest depths of the Darklands, perhaps as a result of botched summonings by xulgath clerics of Zevgavizeb. Whether by chance or through the intent of their creator, xilvireks have begun to stretch their reach beyond the evolutionary nightmare of the Abyss.
