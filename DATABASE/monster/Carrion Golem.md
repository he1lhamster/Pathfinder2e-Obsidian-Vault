# Carrion Golem

Carrion golems are foul-smelling and fly-swarmed amalgams of putrefied parts stitched together from many different creatures. Unlike most golems, carrion golems only rarely are given a humanoid form, instead appearing more twisted and bestial in frame. As a result, some students of golem crafting claim that the carrion golem isn't a “true golem,” but regardless of those claims these foul constructs certainly share other golem-like traits, including their significant immunities. What is true is that most who craft carrion golems don't do so out of true interest in the technique of golem crafting, but for the golem's ability to spread disease. The crafters of carrion golems send their mindless minions to cause immediate destruction and leave wakes of illness and death behind them.

###  Carrion Golem Components

The decaying body parts that make up a carrion golem are of little value in most cultures. However, the magic used to preserve them and infuse them with disease can still be harnessed by unscrupulous necromancers and other practitioners of foul arts. Such creatures may be willing to purchase a destroyed carrion golem, but the processes used to extract the power within the pieces are difficult and inefficient, so they won't pay much.
