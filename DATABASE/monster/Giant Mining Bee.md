# Giant Mining Bee

Giant mining bees have smaller bodies than giant worker bees but sometimes look larger due to their bristles, which resemble fur. They dig tunnels in sand, old wood, or stone to create nests and aggressively defend their lairs. Although not truly subterranean, giant mining bees are the most likely type of giant bees to be found underground, and some [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarf]] apiarists breed and train them.
