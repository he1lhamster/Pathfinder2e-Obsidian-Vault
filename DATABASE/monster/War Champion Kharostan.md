# War Champion Kharostan

Kharostan is a half-[[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Daemon|daemon]] [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Urdefhan|urdefhan]] and the primary leader of the largest urdefhan settlement in the Black Desert. The urdefhans say an [[DATABASE/monster/Astradaemon (Void Daemon)|astradaemon]] lives in the left side of his body, giving him his great strength and strange abilities.
 Kharostan grew up knowing he bore the blood of daemons; he was much bigger than other young urdefhans, and his anger gave him undeniable strength. Yet he saw his potent daemonic blood as a curse. His back and limbs were plagued by terrible aches and he was often overwhelmed by rages and visions he didn't understand. No one dared mock him to his face, but behind his back, young urdefhans and adults alike called him names and questioned his competence.
 Once Kharostan became an adult, he announced his intention to claim the throne of the Spear Hill cult, challenging Urserf to single combat. Much to Urserf's dismay, none of the cult's daemon-binders objected, and Urserf grudgingly accepted the challenge to save face. Kharostan was too fast and strong for the old war champion, and he quickly defeated and killed him.
 Upon claiming his position as the Spear Hill cult's war champion, Kharostan made many lofty promises to his subjects—he pledged to unify the urdefhans of the desert and take the city of Shraen from the undead [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Drow|drow]]. But years have passed, few of his promises have been realized, and Kharostan now finds his position increasingly tenuous. No urdefhan is strong enough to challenge him alone, but he knows he must fulfill his promises, and quickly, to avoid unifying his foes.
 Kharostan loves to fight, slaughter, and take slaves, but to him, death and destruction are only a means to an end. He dreams of a future where his people can rise above endless warfare and become something even stronger. As is traditional for many war champions, Kharostan has a trio of dominators who act as his personal advisors, though he doesn't trust them. The advisors seldom agree with one another, and while Kharostan listens to each one carefully, he usually chooses a solution that combines the best ideas of the three rather than siding with one advisor over the others. When the three advisors agree, Kharostan completely disregards their advice.
 In addition to being much larger than other urdefhans, Kharostan bears a mismatched appearance. The left side of his body is clearly more muscular than the right side, which is strong but sinewy. He is blind in his right eye, and black blood constantly oozes from its corner. He wears only loose strips of cloth wrapped around his body beneath piecemeal armor, intentionally leaving much of his transparent skin exposed.

## Campaign Role

Kharostan is suspicious of intruders within his territory and has instructed the Spear Hill warriors to capture any humanoids or beasts worth taking as slaves or using for food, and to kill the rest. When he learns of a group of surface-dwellers who defeat his hunters and daemons with relative ease, however, he becomes curious.
 Kharostan is something of an unlikely ally for the heroes. He is willing to ally with strangers because he is desperate to gain information about the drow's interest in the Cradle of Worms. But if the heroes anger him, he goes to great lengths to obtain revenge.

He can also make a Wicked Bite each time he damages a creature with his jaws Strike, in addition to the usual once per round usage for a free action.

If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature takes both effects, rolling the saving throw once and using the result for both effects.

* **Drain Blood** Kharostan drinks some of the victim's blood. On a failed save, the victim is [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]], and Kharostan regains 20 HP (on a critical failure, the creature is doomed 2 and drained 2, and Kharostan regains 40 HP).
* **Drain Vitality** (necromancy) Kharostan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or enfeebled 3 for 1 hour on a critical failure).
