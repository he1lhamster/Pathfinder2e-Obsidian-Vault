**Shame** A ghostly guard suffers from shame (see below) when it attacks a target that appears to be an elf or a worshipper of Calistria. Forgive Foe can be attempted against a ghostly guard with a DC 39 Diplomacy check or Society check. If a ghostly guard is affected by a critical success from Forgive Foe, it sighs in relief as it fades away, its soul released into the afterlife.
**Site Bound** A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location.

### The Power of Forgiveness

Some of the creatures in the House at the Edge of Time—the ghostly guards and defaced naiad queens, but most notably Nyrissa herself—still harbor vestiges of goodness in their minds and souls that can be appealed to by PCs who seek to forgive them for their actions. A PC can learn about the Forgive Foe action accidentally if they seek to appeal to a creature in the House at the Edge of Time in this way on their own, or they can learn about it by closely observing how certain creatures act when they attack certain foes.
 These foes have a Shame entry in their stat block. When such a foe attacks specific targets delineated in their Shame entry, they suffer a –2 status penalty on attack rolls and to all save DCs to resist their spells or attacks. Whenever such a creature takes an action that triggers this penalty, all creatures within 30 feet can attempt a Perception check against the acting creature's Deception DC. On a success, the creature attempting the check realizes the creature taking the action is suffering from guilt and shame at their own action; this reveals that a Forgive Foe action might help the acting creature recover from its plight.

You make an attempt to force a foe to confront its guilt and face its shame for its actions. When you do so, attempt either a Diplomacy check or another check as indicated in the creature’s Shame entry; the DC is the creature’s Will DC.
**Critical Success** Your words strike home and allow the creature to escape its servitude to the House at the Edge of Time. The specific effects of this are listed in the creature’s Shame entry.
**Success** Your words give the foe pause. It suffers a –2 status penalty on all attacks, effect DCs, and its Will DC against additional Forgive Foe attempts until the end of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt fails so dramatically that you instead fuel the creature’s wrath and effectively blind it to its sense of shame and guilt. For the next 24 hours, it no longer suffers the effects of shame when it attacks you and you can no longer attempt to Forgive that Foe.
