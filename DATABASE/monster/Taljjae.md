# Taljjae

The form of Taljjae's body can vary from visit to visit or even moment to moment, but it's easily recognized due to its signature cloak and masks. So long as Taljjae's mood is placid, it can be approached safely, but its mercurial temperament can be hard to predict.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Jelly Gluttony** If Taljjae detects buckwheat jelly with its jelly sense, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] by the food and the creature possessing it (if applicable) and [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to all other creatures for 1d4 rounds, or until it uses an appropriate number of Interact actions to consume the jelly (generally 2: 1 to take the jelly, and another to eat it).

### Taljjae's Masks

Taljjae carries three masks at any given time. While countless masks have been documented over the ages, the seven listed below are among those best known.
 **In Taljjae's Possession**: When Taljjae Changes Characters, it gains access to the listed abilities. Any items (such as weapons) associated with its previous mask immediately disappear and are replaced by fresh ones for its new mask, but the effects of any mask abilities it has active persist. Removing a mask and later reapplying it doesn't restore any limited-use abilities.
 **As Player Items**: Those who gain one of Taljjae's masks, either by defeating Taljjae or some other means, are known as its understudies and gain a fraction of its power. Each of Taljjae's masks is an 18th-level unique item with the invested and magical traits; if broken, they're automatically repaired to full HP when invested during daily preparations. The effect of a mask on a PC is noted in the mask's Understudy entry. Wearing one of Taljjae's masks also imposes Taljjae's jelly sense and jelly gluttony on the creature as long as it wears the mask.

### The Beast

With this mask, Taljjae assumes a low stance and gathers power.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws +35 (deadly 3d12, magical, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 4d10+18 piercing plus [[DATABASE/monsterability/Knockdown|Knockdown]]
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw +35 (agile, magical, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 4d6+18 slashing
 [[DATABASE/monsterability/Rend|Rend]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw

---

**Understudy** The Beast brings out its wearer's feral nature, granting it a claw melee unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage and has the agile trait, or increasing the damage die of their claw unarmed attack from 1d4 to 1d6 damage if they have a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d4 damage.

### The General

Carved scars mark the face of this severe mask, which gives Taljjae the skill at arms of a veteran commander.
 **[[DATABASE/monsterability/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]]** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Taljjae disrupts actions on any hit, not just a critical hit.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> glaive +35 (deadly 3d8, forceful, magical, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 4d8+18 slashing plus 1d6 chaotic
 **Masterful Engagement** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** Taljjae maintains the perfect distance between itself and its foe. It Steps and Strikes, in any order.

---

**Understudy** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The General grants its wearer a +3 status bonus to attack rolls with [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Polearm|polearms]] for 1 minute.

### The Grandmother

The kind eyes of this mask sap any attackers' will to fight while granting Taljjae powerful supportive magic.
 **Gentle Facade** (aura, emotion, mental) 60 feet. Serenity and a sense of ease blot out all other emotions. Creatures in the emanation must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or become unable to be affected by beneficial emotion effects while within the aura and for 1 minute after leaving it. The creature is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
 **Divine Spontaneous Spells** DC 37, attack +29; **9th** [[DATABASE/spell/Energy Aegis|energy aegis]], [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]], [[DATABASE/spell/Heroism|heroism]], [[DATABASE/spell/Spell Immunity|spell immunity]], [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]]; **8th** [[DATABASE/spell/Regenerate|regenerate]], [[DATABASE/spell/Repulsion|repulsion]], [[DATABASE/spell/Searing Light|searing light]]; **7th** [[DATABASE/spell/Breath of Life|breath of life]], [[DATABASE/spell/Outcast's Curse|outcast's curse]], [[DATABASE/spell/Vital Beacon|vital beacon]]

---

**Understudy** The Grandmother allows its wearer to cast 8th-level _heal_ and 7th-level _breath of life_, each as a divine innate spell, once per day.

### The Hermit

This wizened male face draws upon the powers of a true sage.
 **Flexible Counterspell** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell of the same or lower level as one of Taljjae's unexpended spell slots; **Effect** Taljjae expends any prepared spell of the same or higher level, losing a spell slot as if it had Cast the triggering Spell. Taljjae then attempts to counteract the spell with a counteract modifier of +27. **Divine Prepared Spells** DC 37, attack +29; **9th** [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]], [[DATABASE/spell/Finger of Death|finger of death]] (×2), [[DATABASE/spell/Weapon of Judgment|weapon of judgment]] (war only); **8th** [[DATABASE/spell/Spirit Blast|spirit blast]] (×3), [[DATABASE/spell/Spiritual Epidemic|spiritual epidemic]]; **7th** [[DATABASE/spell/Blade Barrier|blade barrier]], _dispel magic_, [[DATABASE/spell/Flame Strike|flame strike]], [[DATABASE/spell/Spellwrack|spellwrack]]; **Cantrips (8th)** [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]], [[DATABASE/spell/Divine Lance|divine lance]], [[DATABASE/spell/Forbidding Ward|forbidding ward]], [[DATABASE/spell/Produce Flame|produce flame]], [[DATABASE/spell/Shield|shield]]

---

**Understudy** The Hermit allows its wearer to cast 8th-level _spirit blast_ and 7th-level _flame strike_, each as a divine innate spell, once per day.

### The Hero

The eyes of this female face seem to glint with determination.
 **Ranged** <span class="action-icon">1</span> longbow +35 (deadly 3d8, magical, propulsive, range increment 100 feet, volley), **Damage** 4d8+14 piercing
 **Cometfall Arrow** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Taljjae fires an arrow that could shoot a star from the sky. All creatures in a 120-foot line take 10d12 piercing damage (DC 37 basic Reflex save); on a critical failure, the target falls to the ground without taking falling damage, and it can't [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]], [[DATABASE/action/Leap|Leap]], [[DATABASE/spell/Levitate|levitate]], or otherwise leave the ground until the end of Taljjae's next turn. Taljjae then can't use Cometfall Arrow for 1d4 rounds.
 **Double Shot** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Taljjae fires two shots, making two Strikes, each against a separate target and with a –2 penalty. Both attacks count toward its multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after it makes both attacks.

---

**Understudy** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The Hero grants its wearer a +3 status bonus to attack rolls with [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Bow|bows]] for 1 minute.

### The Nobleman

This twisted mask mocks members of the nobility for their parasitic greed.
 **Parasitic Healing** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature within 60 feet regains Hit Points; **Effect** Taljjae takes what should belong to another. The triggering creature regains only half the number of Hit Points, and Taljjae regains the full amount.
 **Covetous Confiscation** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Taljjae holds out a hand and attempts to take something that doesn't belong to it. It telekinetically attracts an unattended, unsecured object of up to 5 Bulk within 100 feet. If the object is in a creature's possession, Taljjae must critically succeed at an attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] that creature, but it can't critically fail.

---

**Understudy** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Effect** The Nobleman allows its wearer to use Covetous Confiscation.

### The Wanderer

The slightly upturned smile of this mask depicts a sense of joy and wonder at travel and new experiences.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> staff +35 (magical, reach 10 feet, two-hand 1d8), **Damage** 4d4+14 bludgeoning
 **Divine Innate Spells** DC 37; Constant (8th) [[DATABASE/spell/Air Walk|air walk]], [[DATABASE/spell/Freedom of Movement|freedom of movement]], [[DATABASE/spell/Haste|haste]]
 **Circling the Kingdom** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Taljjae Strides twice and makes two quarterstaff Strikes at any point along its movement.
 **[[DATABASE/monsterability/Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]** Taljjae deals an additional 2d6 precision damage to [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] foes.
 **Waypoints** Taljjae leaves behind images of itself as it travels. Whenever it makes a Strike, it leaves behind a ghostly image of itself that lasts until the beginning of its next turn. These images block movement for Taljjae's enemies, and they provide flanking to Taljjae and its allies.

**Understudy** The Wanderer allows its wearer to cast 7th-level _air walk_ and 8th-level _freedom of movement_, each as a divine innate spell, once per day.
