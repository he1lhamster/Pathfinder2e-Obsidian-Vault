###  Megaloceros Antlers

The antlers of a megaloceros are some of the most impressive animal trophies, known to fetch a fair price among collectors, particularly those who live far from regions where these majestic elk live. A set of megaloceros antlers in collectible condition can fetch prices of 40 gp, but as with all animal trophies, peddling in such wares can attract the attention of angry druids, vengeful rangers, or offended naturalists.
