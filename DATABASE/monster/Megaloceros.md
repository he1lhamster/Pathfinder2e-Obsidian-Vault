# Megaloceros

Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering creature with antlers that alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. These antlers are enormous and can be wider than their bodies are long. Megaloceroses stand up to 9 feet tall, weighing 1,500 pounds and with antlers growing over 12 feet wide.

###  Megaloceros Antlers

The antlers of a megaloceros are some of the most impressive animal trophies, known to fetch a fair price among collectors, particularly those who live far from regions where these majestic elk live. A set of megaloceros antlers in collectible condition can fetch prices of 40 gp, but as with all animal trophies, peddling in such wares can attract the attention of angry druids, vengeful rangers, or offended naturalists.
