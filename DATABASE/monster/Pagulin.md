# Pagulin

Pagulins are massive, multi-legged lizards that stalk the mountain passes of the Five Kings Mountains. These reptiles hunt [[DATABASE/monster/Elk|elk]] and [[DATABASE/monster/Augdunar|augdunars]] by lying in wait behind rock formations or within the openings of caves. Pagulins produce a mildly acidic saliva that they spit at prey to temporarily blind them before moving in for the kill. A pagulin's tail features a deadly thagomizer, four large spikes that it uses to impale prey to prevent their escape. Five Kings citizens know that pagulins are much smarter than they look, with many reports of pagulins intentionally allowing prey to escape, only to follow a creature to its den and feast on its entire family.
 Though pagulins are deadly, most in the Five Kings Mountains are indifferent to them. Pagulins tend to rest for days at a time after a hunt, spending time to digest their massive kills. They're particularly territorial, however, and will gladly rouse from a post-meal stupor to defend their lairs. The lizards are also known to attack anything that interrupts a hunt or scares off prey. Many merchant caravans have dealt with an unexpected pagulin attack after riding past a herd of startled deer.

###  Pagulin Lairs

Pagulins tend to reside within the countless natural caves of the Five Kings Mountains. Identifying these caves is generally easy as the cavern floor and walls are pocked with small holes created from pagulin spittle. While pagulins are most common within the Five Kings Mountains and surrounding ranges, they also live in the more arid steppes and mountain ranges of northwestern Avistan. These pagulins are rarer than their Five Mountains cousins but have adapted to their differing environment. Rather than residing in caves, they create small burrows beneath shrubs or squeeze into crevices between large rocks. Reports of northern pagulins note how they're much more irritable, which some attribute to the hotter climes of these regions. Others attribute this to the cooler nights, as these pagulins seem most irritable early in the morning.
