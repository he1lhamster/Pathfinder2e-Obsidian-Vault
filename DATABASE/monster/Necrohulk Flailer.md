# Necrohulk Flailer

Additional limbs, failing tentacles, and rubbery bodies are common among Mana Wastes mutants, and aspiring necrohulk creators like to combine flesh from more than one of these kinds of mutants to create gangly but powerful warriors.

###  Eerie Infiltrators

Necrohulk flailers can fit into shockingly small spaces and are often commanded to wriggle up storm drains or through narrow crevices to attack foes. As they don't possess much independent initiative, however, necrohulk flailers can get confused or stuck, posing a danger to anyone who happens to come across them, even months or years later.
