# Cuetzmonquali

Though stories call it the Burning Dragon, Cuetzmonquali is a unique creature with no draconic heritage.
 Cuetzmonquali resembles an enormous reptile with large frills, two tails ending in massive stingers, and scales that appear to be made of burning flame. Cuetzmonquali is capable of growing any number of horns from its head, on which it can impale and trap its enemies. Each horn grows in a burst of searing flame that burns flesh and scales and results in a blackened obsidian spike jutting from its forehead. These horns molt off occasionally, leaving behind warnings of the beast's presence.
 In combat, Cuetzmonquali is a terrifying foe who uses its horns to skewer foes, unleashes white-hot blasts of flame to devastate those who don't approach, and injects a potent burning venom that ignites a foe from within their own body, sapping their strength. Against groups of weaker foes, it simply tramples them to death underfoot. Anyone courageous enough to face Cuetzmonquali and powerful or cunning enough to slay the creature can lay claim to the treasure that lies in its belly: the legendary artifact known as the [[DATABASE/equipment/Spear of the Destroyer's Flame|Spear of the Destroyer's Flame]].

**Follower of the Flame** Cuetzmonquali recognizes the might of the wielder of the _[[DATABASE/equipment/Spear of the Destroyer's Flame|Spear of the Destroyer's Flame]]_. Out of its respect for that strength, it follows the commands of the spear's wielder and can understand the wielder, regardless of the language the wielder speaks.
**Smoke Vision** Smoke doesn't impair Cuetzmonquali's vision; it ignores [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealment]] from smoke.

Cuetzmonquali doesn't need to use additional actions to keep the creature grabbed; the creature remains grabbed as long as it's impaled.
