# Zuipnyrn (Moon Mole)

This spectacularly odd creature appears every now and again in various traveling circuses around the Inner Sea. Although carnival barkers make any number of claims about this strange being’s origins, the so-called “moon mole” is in fact an alien creature called a zuipnyrn, hailing from a distant planet beyond Golarion’s star system.
 In their infancy, zuipnyrns are spherical and furry, with few features other than a single eye stalk and a round, toothless feeding hole. A zuipnyrn’s body is particularly soft and malleable, allowing it to withstand falls and other hazards. Its eye stalk has the ability to produce a blinding burst of light as a defensive measure, which allows a zuipnyrn just enough time to escape in times of danger. Even more incredibly, a zuipnyrn can emit a hypnotic aura from its eye to entrance those around it—an ability it uses to avoid conflict and to persuade bystanders into helping it escape perilous situations. As they age and grow, zuipnyrns adapt to their environment by growing additional limbs, sprouting additional sensory organs, developing gills, or otherwise altering their anatomy to suit the area.

###  Charming Children

Zuipnyrns do not raise their own young; instead, infant zuipnyrns entrance other creatures with their hypnotic gaze, which thereafter feel an almost instinctual obligation to raise the beguiling alien as its own offspring. Thus, a zuipnyrn can turn would-be predators into caretakers instead.
