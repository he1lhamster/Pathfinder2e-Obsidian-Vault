The creature falls 25 feet (assuming the tyrannosaurus flings it as high as it can) and takes falling damage accordingly. If the flung creature lands on another creature, the creature it lands on takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage. The creature being landed upon can attempt a DC 29 basic Reflex save.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Pin Prey** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The tyrannosaurus critically hits a Large or smaller foe with its **foot**. **Effect** The creature struck by the foot is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] and the tyrannosaurus uses its foot to hold the creature in place. As long as the tyrannosaurus doesn't move from its position, the pinned creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|Grabbed]]. A tyrannosaurus gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack a creature it has pinned in this manner, but it cannot use swallow whole on the target unless it uses its jaws to [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grab]] the victim first.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (attack) Medium, 4d6+8 bludgeoning, Rupture 34</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tail Swipe** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The tyrannosaurus sweeps its tail in a 15-foot cone, dealing 4d8+12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the cone. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 34 Reflex save. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature takes half damage. 
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. 
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and falls prone.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Trample|Trample]]** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Huge or smaller, foot, DC 34</span>
