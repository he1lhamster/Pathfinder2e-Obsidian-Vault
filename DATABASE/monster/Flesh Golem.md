# Flesh Golem

Made of odd scraps of skin and muscle, a flesh golem is a grotesque parody of life. Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard the laboratories and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a flesh golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.

###  Flesh Golems

Few buyers want anything to do with the remains of a destroyed flesh golem. An adventurer’s best bet for profiting off of a flesh golem body is to disassemble it piece by piece, extract the few contraptions of steel and copper meant to harness electricity, and sell the parts to tinkerers who ask few questions.
