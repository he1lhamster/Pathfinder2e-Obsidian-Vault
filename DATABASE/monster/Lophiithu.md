# Lophiithu

Lophiithus dwell in the deepest ocean trenches, places untouched by light, hope, or mortal comprehension. They appear to be gaping maws with distended jaws, vestigial flaps of putrefying flesh, and filamentous tentacles tipped with glowing light. Their extraplanar mouths take up most of their bodies, leaving no room for other organs, and any prey they swallow is transported to the [[Maelstrom]] for digestion.

Creatures that cut themselves free instead find themselves in the Maelstrom near nothing but one of the lophiithu's disembodied stomachs.

###  Planar Digestion

A lophiithu's stomachs are scattered across islands in the [[Maelstrom]]. Extraplanar scholars remain unclear as to how these stomachs grow independently of a lophiithu, but are unsurprised by the planar abilities of the stomachs. Expeditions into the Maelstrom have turned up stomachs ranging from as small as a human fist to as large as mountains, suggesting the existence of enormous lophiithus.
