# Kareq

A kareq looks like a cross between a dinosaur and an insect. The kareq's torso extends back into a bulbous abdomen like an ant's.
 A kareq has a resonance chamber in its lower body, and when it flexes its muscular back legs against it, pressure builds up and sound waves are amplified and then focused as the kareq opens its mouth and releases the blast. The resulting shock wave can easily kill.
 Kareqs are thought to be related to Golarion's [[DATABASE/monster/Destrachan|destrachans]], though their similarities may simply be the result of convergent evolution. Unlike the stronger subterranean destrachans, kareqs are native to a variety of different environments, most often jungles and forests. A few sandy-colored species are found in the deserts of the Colonies, where [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Formian|formians]] regard the beasts as noble or, in some cases, practically sacred.
 Kareqs tend to be solitary predators, bold and unafraid, even willing to take on predators significantly larger than themselves. In combat, they keep their distance at first, softening up opponents with their boomstrikes before moving in for the kill with their claws.
 While they don't usually hunt in populated areas, kareqs are extremely territorial, and their desire to lay claim to tall landscape features can bring them into conflict with humanoids. During mating season, a kareq seeks height, climbing to the top of hills, boulders, or—if a settlement is particularly unlucky—towers and other buildings. From these perches, kareqs blast out their booming mating call which can carry for dozens of miles.
 A typical kareq stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder and is 10 feet long, weighing up to 300 pounds.

###  Kareq Drums

Castrovelians have long hunted kareqs, both for glory and to harvest their unique abdomens. A ceremonial drum made from a kareq resonation chamber is an intimidating mark of prestige. While most such drums are only instruments, a properly enchanted kareq war drum can bring down walls and blast apart enemy troops.
