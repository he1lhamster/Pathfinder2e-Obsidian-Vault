Further damage dealt by the wight commander's unarmed and bound weapon attacks increases the value of the drained condition by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spawn Wight Soldier** (divine, necromancy) A living humanoid killed by a wight commander's weapon or claw Strike rises as a different wight spawn of the commander's level or lower (most often a [[Hunter Wight]] or [[Prowler Wight]]) after 1d4 rounds. This wight spawn is under the command of the wight commander that killed them. They don't have drain life or spawn wight and are [[Clumsy]] for as long as they're a wight spawn. If the creator of the wight spawn dies, the wight spawn becomes a fully autonomous wight; they regain their free will, gain drain life and spawn wight, and are no longer clumsy.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tactical Direction** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (auditory) Each wight ally in a 30-foot emanation gains the [[Attack of Opportunity]] reaction until the end of their next turn.</span>
