This is similar to [[Grab]] the creature, but the giant tick moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The giant tick is [[Flat-Footed]] while attached. If the giant tick is killed or pushed away while attached to a creature on which it has used Blood Drain, that creature takes 1 [[Persistent Damage]].

This deals 1d4 damage, and the giant tick gains temporary Hit Points equal to the damage dealt. A creature that has its blood drained by a giant tick is [[Drained]] until it receives healing (of any kind or amount).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tick Fever** (disease) **Saving Throw** DC 17 Fortitude; **Onset** 1 day; **Stage 1** [[Enfeebled]] (1 day); **Stage 2** enfeebled 2 (1 day).</span>
