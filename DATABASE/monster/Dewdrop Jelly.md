# Dewdrop Jelly

Dewdrop jellies are small water elementals resembling jellyfish made of gelatinous bubbles. They typically travel in small schools, floating through the air or swimming through the endless seas of their home plane. When threatened, the jellies discorporate into a thin, vaporous mist, reconstituting into their bubble shape only after the danger has passed. Their clever elusiveness makes them hard to find, leading some to claim that dewdrop jellies are mythical flights of fancy told to entertain children.
