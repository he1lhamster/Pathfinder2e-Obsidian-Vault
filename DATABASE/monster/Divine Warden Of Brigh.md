# Divine Warden Of Brigh

Imbued with the divine energy of the goddess of clockwork and invention, divine wardens of [[DATABASE/deity/Brigh|Brigh]] are prominent in Alkenstar as guardians of the Temple of Brigh there. The Bronze Lady might have her largest following in this metropolis. But the city's boomtown atmosphere means that security is a concern even on holy ground. Citizens and visitors to Alkenstar know about its wind-up sentries or quickly learn about them. The High Clockmother, head priestess of Brigh's holy place, keeps divine wardens in the goddess's image visible in the sanctuary and on the grounds. These automatons are as much a warning to would-be thieves or troublemakers as they are an inspiration to Brigh's worshippers. The mixing of divine and arcane in these constructs is intended to show off innovation and evoke Brigh's power over earth, fire, metal, and smoke.

**Wind-Up** For a divine warden of Brigh to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. The divine warden shuts down immediately once it has 0 time remaining.
 A divine warden can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).
 A creature can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]] to wind a divine warden down (DC 27). For each success, the warden loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the warden is in standby mode.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Clockwork Wand** The divine warden uses a mechanical wand as a focus to channel magical energy. This wand is built into the divine warden's chest, with only the crystal at the end exposed. The warden can Interact to remove the wand, or someone else can remove it with a DC 32 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]]. The divine warden becomes unable to cast any spells except cantrips while the wand is removed.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> When removed, the _clockwork wand_ is a magic wand containing the last 2nd-level innate spell the divine warden cast (the GM determines the spell randomly if the divine warden has not cast any eligible spells). The spells are placed within the wand while the divine warden is created, and the creator can substitute other arcane spells of the appropriate level.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Divine Destruction** (divine, necromancy) When the divine warden is reduced to 0 HP, it erupts with divine energy in a 30-foot emanation, dealing 10d6 positive damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 29 Will save with the following outcomes. </span><span class="in-box-ability">**Critical Success** The creature takes half damage. </span><span class="in-box-ability">**Success** The creature takes full damage. </span><span class="in-box-ability">**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes temporarily cursed by Brigh to be [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 day; this is a curse effect with a counteract DC of 29. </span><span class="in-box-ability">**Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature becomes enfeebled 2 and stupefied 2.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Faith Bound** (abjuration, divine) The divine warden can't attack a creature that openly wears or displays Brigh's religious symbol unless that creature uses a hostile action against the divine warden first.</span>
