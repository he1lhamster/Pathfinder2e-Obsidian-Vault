  denizens of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Metal|Plane of Metal]] . Many taloses
  mold their natural talent for metalwork into careers as tinkerers, miners, or smiths,
  although just as many leverage the luster of precious metals in a quest for fame
  and fortune.<br/><br/> Taloses are among the most metropolitan of geniekin, often
  born in or drawn to cities of various sizes, especially those with advanced metalworking
  or technology trades. Metal often needs to be worked to find its form and function,
  which may explain why many taloses seem to enjoy living among people, if not necessarily
  socializing with them. They often find themselves stumbling into jobs somewhere
  along the production line of technology, whether it''s mining the raw ore from the
  earth, working it into wires and gears, or constructing the devices themselves.
  Some taloses resent and reject the expectations that they fill such roles, but many
  embrace their fascination with tech, often going on to become expert inventors.
  Taloses are therefore far more likely than other geniekin to make use of clockwork

  albeit in small numbers, taloses have only rarely been recognized as geniekin. The
  largest number of them, and also the largest number whose true nature is known,
  inhabit Tian Xia. The traditions of metal as an element have lived much longer there.
  Taloses often find themselves drawn to discussions and study of elemental metal
  the instant they hear of the concept. Historical records speak of renowned courtiers
  and diplomats with skin of flawless silver or bronze. In the Ivory Port of Goka,

###  Traveling Tinkerers

While there are no known permanent talos settlements in the [[Material Plane]], there is a small nomadic community known as the Tinkerers' Caravan. Originally founded in Vudra and inspired by similar clans of janns and sulis, the caravan now travels throughout most of the eastern world, offering all taloses who wish to travel with them a sense of community and belonging that they might not find anywhere else.
