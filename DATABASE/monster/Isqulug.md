# Isqulug

The isqulug's appearance, though unsettling, might be its least awful aspect. The creature resembles a bipedal amphibian with tentacles instead of arms and a head composed of an undulant mass of what appear to be shifting, slimy transparent eggs filled with writhing larvae. In truth, these larvae constitute the mind and consciousness of the isqulug—its “body” is little more than an organic suit manufactured from the flesh of those it has consumed, analogous to the complex web of a spider or the hive of a colony of bees, but fully capable of movement and violence.

###  Exiles from Beyond

These disgusting parasites originally manifested in the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]], but the fey denizens of that realm found them too awful to endure and exiled them to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]. Over time, the isqulugs sloughed off their fey features for new, more powerful bodies of their own. Reports of stranger variants flourishing in areas such as [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demon]]-defiled Tanglebriar and remote fungi-ridden vaults in Orv, however, suggest their foothold on Golarion has become more established than previously thought.
