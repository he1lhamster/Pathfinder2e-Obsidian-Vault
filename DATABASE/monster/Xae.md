**Speed** fly 25 feet
<span class="in-box-ability">**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> ghostly hand +21 [+17/+13] (agile, finesse, magical), **Damage** 2d10+12 negative</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Shyka's Judgment** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (enchantment, mental, primal) Xae clasps her hands together and cries out in Sylvan for Shyka to judge those who dare intrude upon the shrine—“Aid me, Shyka, so that your shrine will remain undefiled!” The seven statues around the perimeter of the room suddenly animate and hurl spectral versions of their hourglass-headed maces into the room, filling area A3 with a whirling vortex of pale blue-and-white energy. All living creatures in area A3 must attempt a DC 30 Will save. Xae cannot call upon Shyka's Judgment for 1d4 rounds.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature takes 6d6 mental damage.
 **Failure** The creature takes 12d6 mental damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] 1 as their mind struggles with memories that seem to be from past lives that weigh the character's current actions in judgment.
 **Critical Failure** The creature takes 18d6 mental damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned]] 1 by their mental struggle with their judgmental past lives. The creature also takes 2d6 persistent mental damage that ends if they leave area A3.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Twist Time** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (primal, transmutation) Xae attempts a ghostly hand strike. If she hits, she inflicts damage as normal, but the target struck must also attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save (the target takes a –2 penalty to this saving throw if the strike was a critical hit).
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] 1 for 1 round as the rest of reality seems to speed up.
 **Failure** The creature becomes decrepit from unnatural aging. It is slowed 2, and as long as it has the slowed condition, it is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]] 2 as well.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature feels death knocking on the door—it is doomed 1 as long as it remains slowed by Twist Time.</span>
