description: While Dimari-Diji's oldest memory is of the sky growing dark and becoming
  filled with fire, he was already several centuries old during the events of Earthfall.
  Memories of his earliest days no longer cling to his mind, and Dimari-Diji knows
  only that he is the youngest [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Arboreal|arboreal]] of his
  copse. His other siblings went their own way when Earthfall occurred, and of the
  few he managed to track down, only Silang-Sefa and Umdasi-Umalo still live.<br/><br/>
  For years, Dimari-Diji wandered the darkened world of Golarion, surviving as best
  he could. He eventually met an old human man who sought knowledge. While Dimari-Diji
  shared what he knew, the man sought more. And so, Dimari-Diji joined the man as
  he slowly unraveled the secrets of magic. While Dimari-Diji was around to help Jatembe
  fulfill his destiny, the arboreal went only so far as point Jatembe to the correct
  locations; Jatembe's efforts in learning magic were entirely his own.<br/><br/>
  After traveling for some more time, Dimari-Diji stumbled upon the nascent Osibu
  and spent some time with its people. It was here that he realized the world beyond
  the forests was changing. The people in Osibu were not like others he had met. They
  remained cut off, unknowing of the world around them. Dimari-Diji did his best to
  warn and prepare the people of the city for the dangers beyond. The people of Osibu
  did not want him to leave, however, and each of the city's wise women pleaded for
  his guidance and protection. After one hundred pleas, Dimari-Diji chose to stay
  and teach the women the secrets of his magic, and that of the other trees and animals.<br/><br/>
  Today, Dimari-Diji is very old, even compared to other arboreals. Though he has
  occasionally traveled into the Mwangi Expanse since his arrival in Osibu, he spends
  nearly all his time in the city and, in fact, rarely moves throughout Osibu. The
  city's leader, Umanja-jinga, the current Uur Chyayu, typically comes to him. He
  sees the one hundred spirits of the first wise women in her, and trusts in her judgment
  and friendship. When speaking with others, Dimari-Diji is always kind and patient,
  listening with intent and allowing others to speak their minds freely and without
  interruption.

# Dimari-Diji, Ancient Arboreal Guardian

While Dimari-Diji's oldest memory is of the sky growing dark and becoming filled with fire, he was already several centuries old during the events of Earthfall. Memories of his earliest days no longer cling to his mind, and Dimari-Diji knows only that he is the youngest [[Arboreal]] of his copse. His other siblings went their own way when Earthfall occurred, and of the few he managed to track down, only Silang-Sefa and Umdasi-Umalo still live.
 For years, Dimari-Diji wandered the darkened world of Golarion, surviving as best he could. He eventually met an old human man who sought knowledge. While Dimari-Diji shared what he knew, the man sought more. And so, Dimari-Diji joined the man as he slowly unraveled the secrets of magic. While Dimari-Diji was around to help Jatembe fulfill his destiny, the arboreal went only so far as point Jatembe to the correct locations; Jatembe's efforts in learning magic were entirely his own.
 After traveling for some more time, Dimari-Diji stumbled upon the nascent Osibu and spent some time with its people. It was here that he realized the world beyond the forests was changing. The people in Osibu were not like others he had met. They remained cut off, unknowing of the world around them. Dimari-Diji did his best to warn and prepare the people of the city for the dangers beyond. The people of Osibu did not want him to leave, however, and each of the city's wise women pleaded for his guidance and protection. After one hundred pleas, Dimari-Diji chose to stay and teach the women the secrets of his magic, and that of the other trees and animals.
 Today, Dimari-Diji is very old, even compared to other arboreals. Though he has occasionally traveled into the Mwangi Expanse since his arrival in Osibu, he spends nearly all his time in the city and, in fact, rarely moves throughout Osibu. The city's leader, Umanja-jinga, the current Uur Chyayu, typically comes to him. He sees the one hundred spirits of the first wise women in her, and trusts in her judgment and friendship. When speaking with others, Dimari-Diji is always kind and patient, listening with intent and allowing others to speak their minds freely and without interruption.

## Campaign Role

As steward of Osibu, Dimari-Diji is intent on defending his city from all potential threats, but particularly those threats that might approach the Nemesis Well. Dimari-Diji feels he is approaching his final years, and he prefers to serve in an advisory or support role.
 When the heroes arrive in Osibu, Dimari-Diji is quick to question the outsiders and recognize the greater threat that Walkena poses to the city. He stays within the city walls, directing forces alongside Umanja-jinga and using his magic to support Osibu during the attack. If the heroes can earn Dimari-Diji's trust by defending the city, they make an invaluable ally with a vast wealth of knowledge and secrets.

**Fungus Sight** (divination, primal) Dimari-Diji produces small clumps of fungus that he can use to see beyond his normal sight. He can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to project his senses into an intact fungus clump on the [[Material Plane]] or to end this projection. Dimari-Diji loses all sensory information from his own body while projecting his senses into fungus.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Forest Growth** Once per month, Dimari-Diji can spend 1 hour to sprout a new forest. He causes the forest to sprout in a 50-foot burst within 300 feet. The forest instantly springs to life, and is composed of fungi, plants, and trees most appropriate to the area he selected. The forest grows to the height, density, and liveliness of a forest that has grown for 10 years. The forest doesn't feature any animals or other creatures, but animals within 1 mile are aware of the new forest and might make the forest their new habitat as appropriate.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Memories of Ages** Dimari-Diji's mental blasts cloud the minds of his foes, making it difficult for them to focus on combat.
