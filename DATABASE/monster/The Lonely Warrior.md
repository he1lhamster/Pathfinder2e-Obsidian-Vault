This spawned wight is under the command of the Lonely Warrior. It doesn't have drain life or cairn wight spawn and is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy]] 2 for as long as it is a spawned wight. If its creator dies, the spawned wight becomes a full-fledged, autonomous cairn wight; it regains its free will, gains drain life and cairn wight spawn, and is no longer clumsy.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drain Life** (divine, necromancy) When the Lonely Warrior damages a living creature with a melee Strike, using an unarmed attack or its bound weapon, it gains 5 temporary Hit Points, and the creature must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]] 1. Further damage dealt by it increases the drained condition value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Lonely Dirge** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (auditory, divine, emotion, fear, mental, necromancy) The Lonely Warrior's funeral dirge is somewhat different from the standard cairn wight dirge: its droning, unnerving chant forces living creatures within 50 feet to attempt a DC 24 Will save. The Lonely Warrior can't chant a new Lonely Dirge for 1d4 rounds.
 **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
 **Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] 1 by gnawing pangs of loneliness until the end of its next turn.
 **Failure** The target is stupefied 1 for 1 hour.
 **Critical Failure** The target is stupefied 1 for 24 hours and takes a –2 status penalty to saves against drain life.
