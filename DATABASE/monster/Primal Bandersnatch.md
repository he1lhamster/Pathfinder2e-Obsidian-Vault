###  Other Bandersnatches

**Warning - this sidebar contains spoilers for the Kingmaker adventure path.**
The bandersnatch presented here is a creature that retains its ties to the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]], known to some scholars as primal bandersnatches. Bandersnatches who have dwelt on the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] for longer periods can be less dangerous, although it's unheard of for a bandersnatch to weaken below 13th level. Just as surely, even more powerful bandersnatches lie in wait in the deepest reaches of the First World.
