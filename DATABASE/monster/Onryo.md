# Onryo

Onryos are created when a person dies violently in the grip of extreme emotion, such as unbridled rage or overwhelming sorrow. These twisted undead return as beings of pure vengeance, seeking to endlessly spread suffering. Onryos torment those who killed them, but not by directly attacking their murderer. Instead, an onryo hunts down the friends, family members, and anyone connected to their foe. In doing so, the onryo inflicts as much torment as possible on the person responsible for their demise. An onryo's vengeful nature persists indefinitely; not even the death of their killer sates their lust for destruction. Vengeance is just a way for them to spread their pain to others, and they quickly find new targets for their ire. Onryos always wear funeral clothing, often dripping wet or covered in filth. Most of them also display wounds or signs indicating how they died. As they move, onryos seem to pop in and out of existence, making them difficult to track in combat.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Flicker** An onryo's erratic movement makes them difficult to target.

The onryo, with their touch, casts a 5th-level [[Geas]] on the creature they hit (DC 30 Will). On a failure, it's forced to seek and slay loved ones of the onryo's wrongdoer and anyone who attempts to defend them for up to one week. On a critical failure, the duration is 1 month and the creature gains Onryo's Rancor, which it's also compelled to use by the geas. Regardless of the outcome, the creature is temporarily immune to Onryo's Rancor from this individual for 1 year.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vengeful Suffocation** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The onryo channels their boundless resentment, manifesting it as a tangled clump of wet hair, a clot of rancid swamp mud, or other disgusting mass of matter in the throat of a creature within 30 feet. The creature must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature becomes [[Sickened]].
 **Failure** The creature becomes sickened 2.
 **Critical Failure** The creature becomes sickened 3 and the mass fully blocks the creature's airway. The creature begins suffocating.</span>

###  Daionryo

Onryos born of the mighty can rise as daionryos with greater abilities related to their deaths or their killers, like controlling the weather to unleash disaster on a larger scale. A daionryo's spirit is so consumed with vengeance that even its destruction isn't enough to stop it. Daionryos have the ability to rejuvenate (as [[Hungry Ghost]]), returning again and again.
