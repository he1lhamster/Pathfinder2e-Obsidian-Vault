# Ittan-Momen

###  The Red Scarf

While generally mischievous, a tsukumogami might form a protective attachment to a person or family. A famous legend speaks of an ittan-momen born from a scarf that was inseparable from the great granddaughter of the woman who wove it. When she departed home to become a soldier, it's said the ittan-momen protected her for many years, even holding her wounds closed in the midst of battle. This legend serves as the reason why a red scarf is seen as a symbol of luck, especially as a gift for those going into battle.
