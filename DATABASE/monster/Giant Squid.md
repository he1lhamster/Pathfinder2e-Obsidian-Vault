Each arm Strike counts separately for the squid's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until the squid has made all of its arm Strikes; the beak Strike uses the multiple attack penalty as normal.</span>

###  Giant Squid Tactics

The giant squid attacks by lashing out with its longest tentacles and then rapidly pulling the prey toward itself. While closing the distance between them, it attacks again, this time closing its smaller arms around the prey. Once it has the prey thoroughly trapped, the giant squid tears and cuts with its beak and the teeth-lined saw it has in the place of a tongue.
