# Dybbuk

The discorporated spirits called dybbuks arise from souls denied respite in the afterlife, often because they committed some great transgression in life. A priest can appease dybbuks by helping them achieve some esoteric mission, though these tricksters are prone to deceiving anyone who offers them aid. Only by trapping, cowing, or destroying such spirits can a mortal hope to drive them back. Dybbuks hide within household objects or possessed victims. They particularly enjoy taking over the body of someone their target loves and then slowly destroying the lives of both.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Inhabit Object** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (necromancy, occult, possession) The dybbuk possesses a Large or smaller unattended object within 20 feet, making it an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Animated Object|animated object]]. This animated object's level can be no higher than the dybbuk's level – 2. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the dybbuk leaves it by using this ability again. At this point, the dybbuk reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds. If the object is destroyed, the dybbuk takes 5d6 force damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Malevolent Possession** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult, possession) The dybbuk attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [[DATABASE/spell/Possession|possession]] spell (DC 34) with an unlimited duration, except since the dybbuk doesn't have a physical body, they aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], and aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] when the effect ends, though they take 5d6 force damage if the body is knocked unconscious or killed. If the dybbuk took control of the target with Malevolent Possession, when the dybbuk departs, the target has only incoherent memories of the interval it was possessed. If a creature dies while possessed by the dybbuk and its corpse remains intact, the dybbuk can immediately inhabit the corpse (see Inhabit Object) as a reaction, in which case the corpse becomes an animated object.</span>

###  Cruel Puppet Masters

Dybbuks revel in tricking mortals and using their telekinetic abilities to sow fear in the hearts of those around them. As if possessing innocents wasn't horrible enough, dybbuks can also continue to control their unwitting puppets even after their hosts have been slain, animating the corpses like macabre marionettes.
