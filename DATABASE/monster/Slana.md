# Slana

The rolling thunder before the rain provides the massive, leonine humanoids known as slanas with a tremendous power. These solitary and nomadic creatures primarily dwell in the jungles and savannas of the Mwangi Expanse, but they can range into nearby areas in search of prey or when drawn by strange primal forces only slanas can recognize. Slanas view each other as rivals who test each other's prowess, so when drawn together by this strange calling they nearly always fight to the death. A slana's roar echoes like thunder across the countryside, and denizens of the Mwangi fear a slana's approach whenever an oncoming storm's thunder seems more ferocious than its rain.

###  The Thunder Lion and the Rain

The hours before an immense storm are hours to be feared, for it is said that this is when the thunder lion hunts. No mere hare or ibex can slake his great hunger; only large and ferocious creatures like elephants or dinosaurs will suffice. The rain won't come until the thunder lion eats, as it is the spirit of its kill that releases such precipitation as it flees into the sky.
