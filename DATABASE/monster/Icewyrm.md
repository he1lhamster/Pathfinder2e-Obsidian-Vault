# Icewyrm

Resembling wingless, serpentine dragons formed of jagged ice and shot through with veins of nearly frozen water, these elementals dwell within icebergs and enjoy striking out at passing ships or creatures. They're especially common in frigid stretches of ocean in the Plane of Water, where icebergs cluster together into enormous islands of ice.

###  Elemental Wyrms

The icewyrm is the most widely encountered elemental wyrm, but others exist as well, including the blazing firewyrm, the sleek but somewhat smaller sparkwyrm, and the largest of them all, the immense and acidic sludgewyrm.
