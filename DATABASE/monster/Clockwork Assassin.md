# Clockwork Assassin

Exceptionally efficient and utterly merciless, clockwork assassins carry out their murderous directives with mechanical precision. Though they can disguise themselves, upon close inspection, they're plainly artificial, with just a single eye and weapons integrated into their arms.

**Integrated Launcher** A projectile launcher is integrated into a clockwork assassin's systems, containing 10 spinning blades and five smoke bombs. When the assassin is destroyed, the launcher and its ammunition are also destroyed.
**Smoke Vision** The clockwork assassin ignores the [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] condition from smoke.
**Wind-Up** For the clockwork assassin to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again.
 The assassin can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).
 A creature can attempt a DC 31 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]] to wind the assassin down. For each success, the assassin loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the assassin is in standby mode.

###  Assassin Augmentations

Clockwork assassins can feature a variety of abilities and mechanisms to better complete their assigned tasks. Assassins expecting to face large groups of enemies have integrated weapons that target multiple foes at once. Other assassins have magical integration, allowing them to cast useful spells.
