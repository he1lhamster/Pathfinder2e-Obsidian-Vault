# Drenchdead

When great heroes or other powerful individuals encounter misfortune and die at sea or to other water-related accidents, the anguished soul sometimes clings to its corpse, creating a drenchdead. Drenchdead prefer to lurk in water and attack from ambush, giving victims the same deadly surprise that led to their own deaths. A drenchdead can manipulate water to drown a victim directly but prefers to draw out this suffering.

On a success against a creature on land, in addition to the normal effects of Grapple, the drenchdead pulls the creature into the water into a space adjacent to itself. If the creature is already in the water, on a success, in addition the normal effects of Grapple, the drenchdead drags the creature 10 feet deeper, moving 10 feet with the creature.

**Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Drowning Touch for 24 hours.

###  Drenchdead on Golarion

Drenchdead are common along coasts but are particularly prevalent in the Shackles and near the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Great pirates might meet their death at [[DATABASE/deity/Ra|Besmara's]] hands just as they were returning home with a massive haul of treasure, or viking raiders could die on their journey across the ocean toward Vallenhall. These proud heroes might rise as [[DATABASE/monster/Draugr|draugr]] or other undead, but the most notable heroes of all become drenchdead.
