# Young Linnorm

As discussed under [[Linnorm]], female linnorms lay eggs in the wilderness, where linnorms are known to hunt. A linnorm egg remains viable for many years, protected by a tough, leathery skin easily mistaken for stone. When a male linnorm eventually stumbles across the egg, he fertilizes it and takes it to a secure and remote location, leaving it alone to eventually hatch. Newborn linnorms remain hidden in their nests for several months as they mature, growing large enough to hunt on their own and setting out into the world. These linnorms are roughly the equivalent of older teenagers when compared to other species. Younger linnorms, while still primal creatures with a strong tie to the [[First World]], haven't yet manifested most of their magical powers. They still can't breathe deadly fire or lightning or see invisible creatures, and, most importantly, they can be slain without prompting the linnorm's legendary death curse. They do, however, have voracious appetites, consuming any living thing to fuel their rapid growth. A linnorm is most vulnerable during this time; scouts who find tracks of a young linnorm quickly muster a hunting party of stalwart and experienced warriors to track the creature down and kill it quickly—before they draw the attention of the linnorm's father.

### Varieties of Young Linnorms

While the statistics for young linnorms suit most uses, you might choose to customize a creature by giving it abilities and traits found in its adult variety.

* **[[Cairn Linnorm]]**: Immune to acid; venom inflicts acid damage instead of poison damage; gains a climb speed of 30 feet; loses [[Constrict]].
* **[[Crag Linnorm]]**: Immune to fire; venom inflicts fire damage instead of poison damage.
* **[[Fjord Linnorm]]**: Immune to cold; venom inflicts cold damage instead of poison damage and [[Clumsy]] instead of drained.
* **[[Ice Linnorm]]**: Immune to cold; venom inflicts cold damage instead of poison damage.
* **[[Shoal Linnorm]]**: Immune to fire; venom inflicts fire damage instead of poison damage.
* **[[Taiga Linnorm]]**: Immune to electricity; venom inflicts electricity damage instead of poison damage; gains Spines; loses Constrict.
* **[[Tarn Linnorm]]**: Immune to acid; venom inflicts acid damage instead of poison damage; gains Double Bite.
* **[[Tor Linnorm]]**: Immune to fire; venom inflicts fire damage instead of poison damage; gains a climb speed of 30 feet.

Despite their sizable threat, presenting the head of one of these linnorm youths is more likely to see a warrior laughed out of town than crowned king. Young linnorms who survive for more than a few months become Huge, gaining elite adjustments and other distinctive linnorm traits, such as [[True Seeing]] and [[Freedom of Movement]]. By the time a linnorm manifests its breath weapon and death curse after a year, it's fully grown into an adult.
