# Babau (Blood Demon)

The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist—certainly not unusual traits, yet their penchant for stealth and surprise sets them apart from their kin. Babaus form from mortal souls of lone killers—those who took pleasure in more personal murders, and particularly those with grisly patterns to their killings.

###  Signs of Murder

Babaus revel in their art and often leave behind a grim token or marker as a signature. They may leave a distinctive mutilation upon the bodies of their victims, rather than harvesting keepsakes and trophies for a personal collection. Babaus want their legacy to grow among those they hunt and kill.
