# Shadow Worm

Shadow worms are monstrous cave worms that dwell on the [[Shadow]]. Larger and more cunning than most cave worms, shadow worms are fearsome predators that leave swaths of devastation in their wake. Most have glossy, black-armored hide, but those that burrow near [[Velstrac]] lands are streaked with dark red, for the blood the velstracs spill has soaked into the very stones these shadow worms consume.

###  Midnight Worms

Though the worms are generally considered to be untamable, some powerful velstracs have recently begun experimenting on shadow worms in hopes of transforming them into mutilated war beasts. So far, only two shadow worms have survived the velstrac's ministrations. The resulting horrors have been dubbed midnight worms.
