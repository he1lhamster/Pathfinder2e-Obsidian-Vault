# Flytrap Leshy

While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, flytrap leshys get along well with other leshys. Nonetheless, they're among the most aggressive leshys, often guarding the most vulnerable places in the natural world with their flytrap mouths and hands.
 When a large threat emerges, pairs of flytrap leshys band together to create amalgams capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal defense suffuses flytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between multiple individuals that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight humanoids—to a flytrap leshy, though, there's nothing strange about sharing your innermost secrets with people you literally merged together with to defend your home from an enemy.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Amalgam** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (polymorph, primal, transmutation) A flytrap leshy can combine itself with an adjacent and willing flytrap leshy that is not currently affected by Amalgam. The leshy using Amalgam physically merges with the target, restoring 3d8 Hit Points to the target. The leshy can Sustain a Spell to continue Amalgam, but once they stop, the target leshy takes 3d8 damage. If the target leshy dies, Amalgam ends at once and the original leshy gains the [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]] condition or increases their dying condition value by 1 if they were already dying. As long as Amalgam is sustained, the target leshy gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, its AC increases to 21, and it gains an additional reaction at the start of each turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The flytrap leshy transforms into a Small flytrap.
