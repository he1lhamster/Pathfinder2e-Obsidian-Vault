# Phantom Beast

The River of Souls, alongside the souls of dead sapient humanoids, also carries the spirits of monsters, animals, and other creatures. Likewise, it draws souls from the broad universe of the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], and thus human and elf souls mingle with those of far stranger creatures from untold worlds. Like any others, these far-flung spirits of strange creatures sometimes wash up on the shores of the [[DATABASE/plane/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]], becoming phantoms far removed from the humanoid forms typically associated with [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghost|ghosts]] and other undead.
 The phantom below is one such entity: a strange beast from a distant world, echoing their behaviors from life as they search for their own fate post-mortem. Their unfamiliar appearance might lead observers to assume they're a monstrous being and attack, finding the phantom beast entirely willing to fight back. More compassionate adventurers might instead seek to help the phantom find their way back to the River of Souls to complete their spiritual journey.
