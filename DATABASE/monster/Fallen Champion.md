# Fallen Champion

While most herexens were clerics or clergy in life, fallen champions were holy crusaders that upheld the ideals of their deity while fighting enemies of the church and defending its congregants. Fallen champions are direct in their actions and wage their divine war on a grand scale. This fallen champion once worshiped the Arcadian goddess [[DATABASE/deity/Kazutal|Kazutal]], also called Mother Jaguar.
