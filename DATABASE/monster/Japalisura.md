# Japalisura

Japalisuras have a perverse propensity for extracting embarrassing truths from the universe, using a combination of artifice and prophecy to obscure the truth and corrupt traditional soothsaying. They have a special talent for manipulation—feeding listeners' worst impulses and prejudices, telling them what their prey most want to hear, and twisting their perceptions to suit the japalisuras' own ends. All this occurs from behind a veil, though, for japalisuras are grotesque fiends with six arms, infinite faces, and an obsession with the profane.
 The first japalisura rose from the remains of three demigod archers, sons of a goddess who feared their rise to power and slew them. Their merged form was so terrifying that they struck a deal with a powerful asura rana to alter their face into something more pleasing. The true cruelty of the enchantment became clear only later—the japalisura had a new face, but that face transformed into a different one every minute, each more hideous than the last.

<span class="in-box-ability">**False Foe** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The japalisura whispers misleading words and falsehoods to one adjacent creature, attempting a [[Deception]] check against the target's Perception DC. 
**Critical Success** For 1 minute, the target believes that one creature of the japalisura's choice is its mortal foe, spending all its actions to reach and attack that creature. At the end of each of its turns, the target can attempt a DC 32 Will save to end the effect early. 
**Success** As critical success except the effect ends at the end of the creature's first turn, without the need for a Will save. 
**Failure** The target sees through the japalisura's attempts at misdirection and is temporarily immune to False Foe for 1 day.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Veil of Lies** Japalisuras can produce infinite arrows, as if from an invisible quiver. Each arrow carries a veil of lies that tears at the target's psyche, dealing 4d6 mental damage while simultaneously imparting an almost addictively sweet sensation. A japalisura's hatchets are also soaked in the same veil of lies. This damage s already reflected in the Strikes above.</span>
