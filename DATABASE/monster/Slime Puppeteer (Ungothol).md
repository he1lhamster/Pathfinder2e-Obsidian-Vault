description: 'A slime mold appears as a mound of earth and detritus covered in a thick
  layer of fungus that exudes a faint stink of decay. The fungus actually shares a
  symbiotic relationship with the slime mold, serving as an external digestive system
  while gaining access to the nutrients it needs. The ooze remains perfectly still
  until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with disgusting pseudopods.
  With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with a foul contagion known as slime
  rot, a horrific disease that painfully breaks down a victim''s flesh. At first,
  the disease manifests as painful rashes and agonized joints. In the later stages,
  though, the flesh of the affected creature actually begins to liquefy and run in
  rivulets as the creature''s spores continue to work. Death, when it occurs, swiftly
  causes the resulting body to split open and release a brand new slime mold.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall

# Slime Puppeteer (Ungothol)

Early in the alghollthu's attempt to control the sapient creatures of Golarion, they created the ungothol to feed them information. These slime-covered creatures would infiltrate humanoid settlements and send back information to their masters using powerful telepathy. Over centuries, the slime puppeteers proved inferior compared to the more versatile [[DATABASE/monster/Faceless Stalker (Ugothol)|faceless stalkers]].
Slime puppeteers disguise themselves as their humanoid meals. They envelop their target, killing it, then the puppeteer's skin and the corpse's skin both become gelatinous and merge. The puppeteer's form replaces the outer layer of the corpse's body, while long, wiry tendrils implant themselves in the corpses' nervous system. The result is a nearly-perfect copy of the dead creature, now controlled from within by the sinister alghollthu agent. The slime puppeteer can speak using the dead creature's voice, though without the original creature's language or memories.

**Telepathic Bond** (telepathy) A slime puppeteer maintains a strong telepathic bond with the alghollthu that created it. This bond has planetary reach, but the puppeteer is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blind]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deaf]] while accessing this bond.

###  Puppeteer Variations

The slime puppeteer is only one attempt at creating a terrestrial spy; the alghollthu created countless more. It's challenging to tell how many of their kind survived until the modern day. Some slime puppeteers traded the sensitivity to hot environments for cold. Others were massively enlarged, targeting various giant communities. There are even rumors of elemental-infused slime puppeteers capable of infiltrating the elemental planes, but so far no solid evidence has been presented to recognized scholars.
