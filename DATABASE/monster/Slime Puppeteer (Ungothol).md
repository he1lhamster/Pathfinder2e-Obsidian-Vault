# Slime Puppeteer (Ungothol)

Early in the alghollthu's attempt to control the sapient creatures of Golarion, they created the ungothol to feed them information. These slime-covered creatures would infiltrate humanoid settlements and send back information to their masters using powerful telepathy. Over centuries, the slime puppeteers proved inferior compared to the more versatile [[DATABASE/monster/Faceless Stalker (Ugothol)|faceless stalkers]].
Slime puppeteers disguise themselves as their humanoid meals. They envelop their target, killing it, then the puppeteer's skin and the corpse's skin both become gelatinous and merge. The puppeteer's form replaces the outer layer of the corpse's body, while long, wiry tendrils implant themselves in the corpses' nervous system. The result is a nearly-perfect copy of the dead creature, now controlled from within by the sinister alghollthu agent. The slime puppeteer can speak using the dead creature's voice, though without the original creature's language or memories.

**Telepathic Bond** (telepathy) A slime puppeteer maintains a strong telepathic bond with the alghollthu that created it. This bond has planetary reach, but the puppeteer is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blind]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deaf]] while accessing this bond.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Stinky Sweat** (aura, olfactory) 10 feet. When a slime puppeteer takes fire damage, they form a layer of pungent slime on their skin that remains until washed away. While the layer is present, creatures adjacent to the slime puppeteer must attempt a DC 24 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the puppeteer's sweat for 1 minute.</span>

The puppeteer only has access to their wing Strike while using Mimic Form. The puppeteer can end Mimic Form as a three-action manipulate activity.</span>

###  Puppeteer Variations

The slime puppeteer is only one attempt at creating a terrestrial spy; the alghollthu created countless more. It's challenging to tell how many of their kind survived until the modern day. Some slime puppeteers traded the sensitivity to hot environments for cold. Others were massively enlarged, targeting various giant communities. There are even rumors of elemental-infused slime puppeteers capable of infiltrating the elemental planes, but so far no solid evidence has been presented to recognized scholars.
