# Akizendri

Akizendris gnaw at sources of knowledge and lore, gleefully corrupting and altering them to vex scholars and sages across the planes with contradictions and untruths. These proteans appear as cackling, serpentine creatures with elongated crocodilian faces, luminous eyes, and arms that vanish at the elbows into swirling clouds of runes before reforming into solid talons.
 Akizendris amuse themselves by rearranging or deleting texts, placing insulting acrostics in poetic verses, and penning crude insults upon title pages. Libraries in such places as [[Heaven]], [[Axis]], and [[Hell]] are especially keen to avoid such contamination, knowing that their records are choice targets for every akizendri in existence.

**Source** [[Bestiary 2]] 
**Perception** +8; [[Darkvision]], entropy sense (imprecise) 30 feet

**Str** +3, **Dex** +4, **Con** +1, **Int** +4, **Wis** +3, **Cha** +1
**Entropy Sense** (divination, divine, prediction) An akizendri can anticipate the most likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the akizendri the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[Nondetection]] or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Protean Anatomy** (divine, transmutation) An akizendri's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the akizendri takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> The akizendri is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If [[Blinded]] or [[Deafened]], the akizendri automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**[[Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The akizendri takes on the appearance of any Small or smaller creature.

**Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Failure** The creature is [[Stupefied]] for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also [[Confused]] for 1 round.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Text Immersion** (divine, transmutation) When the akizendri casts [[Secret Page]], it can physically immerse itself in the text, changing the message of the text in the process. It can exit the book at any point by Dismissing _secret page_, at which point it appears in a space adjacent to the text. If it does so to begin combat, it rolls a [[Deception]] check for initiative. As long as it remains immersed in the text, the akizendri has no body. It can communicate telepathically with a creature as long as the creature touches the book or scroll that contains the secret page. It can sense nearby creatures using its entropy sense, but not in any other way, nor can it use any attack, manipulate, or move actions or speak aloud. If the object it is immersed in is destroyed, the akizendri reappears in an adjacent square and is [[Stunned]].</span>

###  Vandals of Chaos

Those who seek secret knowledge beyond their means to purchase can bargain with akizendris to provide them with rare tomes in exchange for delivering the immersed akizendri into a library via another book. From there, the akizendri can vandalize books to its heart's content without being detected.
