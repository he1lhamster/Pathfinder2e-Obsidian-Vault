# Whimwyrm

Whimwyrms are unpredictable dragons native to the whimsically dangerous [[First World]]. While their coloration and appearance might evoke reactions of adoration, their moods shift quickly from one extreme to the other. Many who have assumed that their adorability and relatively small size equates to safety have met swift and grisly ends on a whimwyrm's fangs or magic.
 A whimwyrm is a slender, sleek dragon, not much longer than seven feet from snout to tail, but its speed in combat is unnerving. When a whimwyrm attacks, be it with its fanged mouth or its long tail, it makes several quick, darting snaps or lashes at once. While stylistically, these attacks consist of multiple bites or lashings, they still resolve as a single Strike.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Mind-Numbing Breath** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (arcane, enchantment, mental) The whimwyrm exhales a 40-foot cone of sparkling magenta mist. Creatures within the area must attempt a DC 38 Will save as their minds are overwhelmed by a sudden riot of false (and typically unpleasant) memories, taking 10d12 mental damage depending on their save. The whimwyrm can't use mind-numbing breath for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Success** The creature becomes outlined in sparkling dust, negating any [[Invisible]] it has in effect for 1 round and takes no damage. 
**Success** The creature takes half damage, and its invisibility is negated for 2 rounds. 
**Failure** The creature takes full damage, is [[Dazzled]] for 1 minute, and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute. 
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is [[Blinded]] for 1 round, dazzled for 1 minute, and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Meddling Tail** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The whimwyrm damages a creature with its whiplashing tail Strike; **Effect** The whimwyrm can attempt to [[Disarm]], [[Shove]], or [[Trip]] the damaged creature.</span>

###  Insult Challenges

When a whimwyrm's insults result in combat, it rolls [[Performance]] for initiative. A PC who engaged in the insults can roll Performance as well, and if they insulted the whimwyrm, it begins the combat [[Stunned]] as it sputters in indignation if the Performance check also exceeds the Whimwyrm's Will DC of 39.
