# Crucidaemon (Torture Daemon)

Of all the ways to die, crucidaemons represent perhaps one of the least desirable: death by torture. The fiend’s shapely body, which appears to be sculpted from iron or mithril, belies a sinister wrath and love of inflicting pain. Crucidaemons particularly enjoy inflicting pain with their curved, serrated daggers, which are attached to their bodies via a chain that pierces each wrist.
 A crucidaemon’s existence is dedicated to subjecting its prey to an eternity of pain and terror. Unlike other daemons, many of which are eager to feed on mortal souls as soon as they can, the crucidaemon takes much greater pleasure in prolonging the agony of its victims. Oftentimes, a crucidaemon will inflict such torment and pain upon its prey that when the end finally comes, the victim tearfully thanks the daemon for the mercy of oblivion. An encounter with a crucidaemon that does not end with its death is far from over—crucidaemons have unequaled patience for those who dare oppose them.

###  Daemonic Trapmakers

Crucidaemons excel at trapmaking, and they line their lairs or the lairs of their masters with mazes of intricate and deadly traps and enchanted _[[DATABASE/spell/Glyph of Warding|glyphs of warding]]_ through which they draw their victims. Perhaps even eerier than the crucidaemon’s methodical nature in trapmaking is its nearly medical interest in the mutilation and crippling of captured foes.
