# Gray Death

Galt's _final blades_ are feared not only for the swift death they bring, but because it's widely rumored the magical guillotines hold on to the souls of the slain and prevent them from passing on to the afterlife. The truth is even worse: a _final blade_ contains only a limited amount of metaphysical space to hold souls, and once it's full, the souls coalesce into a fearsome, malevolent entity called a gray death. The more souls trapped by a _final blade_, the more powerful the gray death becomes. A gray death doesn't pose much of a threat while contained within the _final blade_, other than to give the guillotine an aura of palpable malevolence. When freed, however, the gray death becomes a nearly unstoppable menace.

### Engineered Disaster

Galt's Gray Gardeners have been intentional in their executions, ensuring each [[DATABASE/equipment/Final Blade|final blade]] has claimed as many souls as possible. After 50 years, every [[DATABASE/equipment/Final Blade|final blade]] now harbors a gray death. The oldest and most well-known [[DATABASE/equipment/Final Blade|final blade]] harbor more powerful and malevolent versions of the creature.
