# Veranallia (Rebirth Azata)

Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt. They rarely interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings find their nature hard to comprehend, but those who secure their aid find them powerful allies. The lower half of a veranallia's body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.
Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and destruction alike. The world around them overflows with an abundance of vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction, they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life. They trigger forest fires in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels, and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.

###  Primordial Veranallia

In the deepest reaches of [[DATABASE/plane/Elysium|Elysium]], the eldest of veranallias roam. These beings concern themselves with transformations that take place over the course of millennia, as well as changes in the climates of entire worlds. Primordial veranallias have an array of unique powers that can affect the area for many miles around them, from turning deserts into glass to triggering earthquakes.
