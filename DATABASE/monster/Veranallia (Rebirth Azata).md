description: 'The white dragon Venexus hatched in Winterwall Glacier, north of the
  Realm of the Mammoth Lords and Irrisen, alongside her brother Fezerod. Upon reaching
  maturity, Venexus and Fezerod migrated south to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords in
  search of unclaimed territory. Although the pair remained together for centuries,
  shortly after they conquered Lost Mammoth Valley together Venexus drove him off.
  The valley was, at the time, a highly frequented migratory route rich in resources,
  wildlife, and humanoids to subjugate. Fezerod fled in heartbreak and shame. In the
  centuries since, Venexus has maintained control of Lost Mammoth Valley, considering
  the region and everything within her property.<br/><br/> The opening of the Worldwound
  to the east forever changed Lost Mammoth Valley and Venexus''s role as its self-appointed
  ruler. Invading demons forced the Burning Mammoth following to abandon most of their
  ancient migratory route, including Lost Mammoth Valley, leaving Venexus without
  intelligent creatures to subjugate. Thankfully, it wasn''t long before a group of
  Sarkorian refugees settled in the valley. After these people, who called themselves
  Sutaki, established a permanent settlement, she made herself known as their overlord.
  To ensure their cooperation, she built her glacial palace alongside them, blocking
  escape from the valley.<br/><br/> Years later, a brave but foolish Burning Mammoth
  warrior named Metuak came to Lost Mammoth Valley seeking Venexus''s aid. He asked
  her to end the curse placed upon him by the Primordial Flame and to free him of
  his possession by the shadow demon Xeleria. Rather than help, Venexus stole the
  Primordial Flame, forcing Metuak to flee for Hillcross. Although Venexus would have
  followed to ensure his death, she hadn''t truly understood the artifact''s curse
  or its powers. The lamp burned her badly and melted her palace, but she couldn''t
  bear to part with it. It became, in time, both her most valuable asset and greatest
  weakness.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Dragon</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]]

# Veranallia (Rebirth Azata)

Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt. They rarely interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings find their nature hard to comprehend, but those who secure their aid find them powerful allies. The lower half of a veranallia's body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.
Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and destruction alike. The world around them overflows with an abundance of vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction, they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life. They trigger forest fires in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels, and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.

###  Primordial Veranallia

In the deepest reaches of [[DATABASE/plane/Elysium|Elysium]], the eldest of veranallias roam.
