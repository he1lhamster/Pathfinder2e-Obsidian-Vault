# Pangolin

Despite their prodigious size, giant pangolins are solitary, reclusive creatures who forage by night for insects and vermin. To defend themselves from predators, they rely on a veritable arsenal of natural defenses to dissuade their foes: thick armor of wickedly sharp scales, a flexible and muscular body capable of rolling into a defensive ball, and a noxious musk. Against more persistent threats, giant pangolins' powerful digging claws prove mighty weapons in a pinch.
 While a pangolin's defenses serve well against natural predators, they've long been targets of poaching by humanoid cultures, partly for meat, but largely due to the high value of their unique scales. These scales see widespread use in alchemy, folk medicine, and crafting, and thus demand for them—and the associated profits from their sale—remain high. Giant pangolins are better protected against humanoid hunters, but the larger size of their scales means wider applications and greater volume. The increased difficulty of acquiring pangolins makes doing so all the more profitable, and unscrupulous poachers can make a considerable living from hunting these creatures.

###  Digging Deeper

Giant pangolins live among the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse and Vudra. The Taralu dwarves of the eastern Mwangi jungles treat these burrowing mammals as kindred spirits, considering their scaled forms to be divine signs of the dragons they venerate. The Taralu's affinity with giant pangolins is so great that these usually friendly dwarves refuse to work with anyone who harms these beasts. The ratfolk of Vudra also favor giant pangolins; they take care to tame any they encounter, for the giant pangolins' sharp senses, powerful digging abilities, and vermin-devouring capacity often prove quite useful when defending warrens and caravans.
