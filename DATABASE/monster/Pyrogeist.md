# Pyrogeist

Born from the deaths of arsonists who died in the fires they started, pyrogeists are roiling infernos whose spectral fire emits no actual heat and harms only living creatures. Obsessed with sharing their torment with the living, pyrogeists haunt the area of their demise until whatever wrong they refuse to forgive has been righted, and they are finally put to rest. While pyrogeists can't set their own fires, they often use their terrifying illusory capabilities and telekinetic powers to lure their victims into setting themselves ablaze.

###  Extinguishing the Spectral Flames

Putting a pyrogeist to rest permanently often requires a ritualist to perform burial rites with at least some fragment of the pyrogeist's mortal remains. Because what's left of a pyrogeist's living form has most likely melted beyond recognition, it can often be difficult to locate. Pyrogeists can sense innately when what lingers of their mortal forms has been disturbed, and often attack without provocation to quell the threat. When a pyrogeist is finally laid to rest and the appropriate sacraments have been performed, the pyrogeist fails to return to and no longer terrorizes the site of its death.
