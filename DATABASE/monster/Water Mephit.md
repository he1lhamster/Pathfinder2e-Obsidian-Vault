# Water Mephit

Water mephits are consummate jokers who are always happy to trade a favor for a good laugh. Just as fire mephits are the ones who cleave closest to evil without fully crossing over into true villainy, water mephits are the friendliest of the mephits and therefore the closest to good. Still, one should take care in making assumptions about a water mephit’s benevolence, for no one can reliably count on them to keep their inborn need for pranks and trickery at bay for long. Water mephits have blue-green skin that shimmers in light like sh scales. Though water mephits’ wings look more like webbed fins than limbs capable of flight, they can flap their wings to fly through the air as easily as any other mephit. Water mephits prefer to swim, when possible, and they leave the water only when they must.
