# Haniver

Hanivers are the most benign type of gremlin—capricious fey who skim the waves on rubbery fin-wings. Though they don't actively sabotage their environment, sailors bemoan these gremlins' grasping fingers. Hanivers' incessant curiosity compels them to examine any object that draws their attention. Such treasures might include an overturned fruit basket, a sack of coins, or a shark's gleaming teeth (often still in the shark's mouth, to the fey's regret). Should hanivers like what they find, they steal it, making them a bane to fishers and dockworkers everywhere.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Rearrange Possessions** <span class="action-icon">1</span> or <span class="action-icon">2</span> (manipulate) The haniver attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]] a small object off a target's person. If they succeed, they also rifle through and rearrange the contents of the target's pockets, pouches, and other containers. The next time the target attempts to draw a weapon or retrieve a worn item, doing so requires two Interact actions instead of one. The haniver can Steal an object that's closely guarded using this action without the –5 penalty, though not objects that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove. They can spend 2 actions instead of 1 to use this ability to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard.</span>

###  Mari Haniver

Sailors sometimes affix a “Mari Haniver” to their ship's prow. Made from a ray's dried carcass, this clever bit of taxidermy resembles a dead haniver enough to scare gremlins away. But should a haniver wise up to the ruse, it will stop at nothing to torment its would-be deceivers.
