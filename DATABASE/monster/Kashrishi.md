description: "In the ancient days, before humanity dwelled on Golarion, the Vault\
  \ Builders had need of something smaller in scale than the great vault seeds so\
  \ they could finish their worlds as they liked. They took a small gem and wrote\
  \ a word of power upon it. They gave it eyes so it could see and legs so it could\
  \ walk, and made it wise. These creatures are known as kaseshi by scholars who have\
  \ encountered them, though their true name\u2014the one that brought them into being\u2014\
  is likely considerably more powerful.<br/><br/> Each kasesh bears a single word\
  \ of power on their emerald body, from which they draw their mind and their magic.\
  \ A kasesh with the word \u201CSteel\u201D or \u201CFlame\u201D is a single-minded\
  \ creature, though it encompasses all possible permutations of meaning that the\
  \ word possesses. A kasesh named \u201CHome\u201D or \u201CSorrow\u201D has a far\
  \ more complex psyche, and rumor claims that Elder Architect Oblosk of Nex bears\
  \ the word \u201CMemory.\u201D Unsurprisingly, many scholars are highly interested\
  \ in the words on the kaseshi; unlike Thassilonian rune magic, no one has managed\
  \ to decode or make use of the language of the Vault Builders yet.<br/><br/> The\
  \ kasesh in the stat block bears the word \u201CStone,\u201D but other kaseshi will\
  \ have their own magics. Some alternative examples, \u201CDarkness\u201D and \u201C\
  Intricacy,\u201D follow below.<br/><br/> <b>Darkness</b>: This kasesh built the\

# Kashrishi

To some, kashrishi seem to be a quiet, passive people. Those with a deeper understanding know that there's plenty more nuance to interacting with kashrishi, who possess innate psychic abilities that greatly alter the way they communicate with the rest of the world. Unable to turn off their powers, these abilities add a complex dynamic to interpreting their surroundings. Without deeper understanding of a person, kashrishi are only able to get the most vague, general feelings from people around them. This becomes more refined as their relationships evolve; family and friends are often the easiest to engage in psychic communication, while strangers simply add to the amount of mental noise a kashrishi must process.
 Kashrishi resemble rhinoceroses, with soft, textured skin that can range from light sandy hues to darker obsidian, or rarer jewel tones of deep sapphire or ruby. The size and number of their horns vary. Kashrishi communities are generally quite welcoming to others, enjoying the conversation and unique auras of every new stranger. However, chaotic environments can overwhelm and overstimulate kashrishi not yet adept at filtering psychic energies, leaving some with limited tolerance for extensive social interaction with strangers and requiring they take periods of time to refocus after socializing. In spite of this possible drawback, kashrishi are typically strong communicators, excelling at roles that require attention to detail.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Empathic Sense** Kashrishi evaluators can get a vague sense of the current emotional state of all other creatures within 15 feet of them, as long as the kashrishi evaluator is aware of those creatures. This manifests as a general feeling of happiness, anger, or fear, without any specific details. Additionally, any creature who succeeds at masking or faking their emotions using [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] projects the deceptive emotions instead of their true feelings. For those that kashrishi have an emotional connection with, physical touch can heighten this sense to greater degrees of detail and understanding, increasing with the strength of their bond.</span>

###  Kashrishi Cuisine

Most Kashrishi are vegetarians. The lingering psychic energy they pick up from once-living creatures makes consuming them difficult. Their staple foods are spiced mixes of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and lentils. The extrasensory abilities of kashrishi have an additional gustatory effect, creating flavor profiles uniquely delicious to kashrishi and fascinatingly eccentric to other ancestries. Those with adventurous palettes often seek out kashrishi cuisine, filling many a kashrishi chef's coffers with gold.
