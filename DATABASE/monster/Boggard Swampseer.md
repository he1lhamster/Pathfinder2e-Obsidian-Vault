The boggard can’t use Destructive Croak again for 1d4 rounds</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drowning Drone** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (auditory, mental) **Trigger** The boggard swampseer or one of its allies within 60 feet attempts a saving throw against an auditory or sonic effect. **Effect** The swampseer releases a croak that drowns out other sound. It rolls a [[Performance]] check. It and boggard allies in the area can use the higher result of the swampseer’s Performance check or their saves to resolve the effects against the auditory or sonic effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Swamp Stride** A boggard swampseer ignores difficult terrain caused by swamp terrain features.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Terrifying Croak** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The boggard swampseer unleashes a terrifying croak. Any non-boggard within 30 feet becomes [[Frightened]] unless they succeed at a DC 19 Will save; those who critically succeed are temporarily immune for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tongue Grab** If the boggard swampseer hits a creature with its tongue, that creature becomes [[Grabbed]] by the boggard. Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn’t [[Immobilized]], but it can’t move beyond the reach of the boggard’s tongue. A creature can sever the tongue by hitting AC 15 and dealing at least 4 slashing damage. Though this doesn’t deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.</span>
