# Hegessik

Anchorites of the proteans, hegessiks live solitary lives roaming the dangerous wilds of the [[DATABASE/plane/Maelstrom|Maelstrom]]. There, they contemplate cosmic truths and dispense wisdom as itinerant mystics. Hegessiks proudly bear their ridges of golden feathers and gleaming gemstones, but it is within their third eye that their wisdom resides. Hegessiks normally have little interaction with the fluctuations of protean society and are more likely to be found liaising with non-protean monitors and followers of those deities—like [[DATABASE/deity/Nethys|Nethys]] and [[DATABASE/deity/Besmara|Besmara]]— who share the Maelstrom with proteans.

**Entropy Sense** (divination, divine, prediction) A hegessik can anticipate the most likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the hegessik the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. The hegessik's entropy sense doesn't detect creatures under the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Nondetection|nondetection]] or that are otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions.

Immediately after the hegessik takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first. </span><span class="in-box-ability">The hegessik is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target.

###  Choruses of One

Heggesiks are nominally included in the protean caste system, but they almost never join the protean choruses formed around shared philosophies. The hegessiks consider themselves to be outside such cliques, seeking their own enlightenment in the archetypal wildernesses of the [[DATABASE/plane/Maelstrom|Maelstrom]].
