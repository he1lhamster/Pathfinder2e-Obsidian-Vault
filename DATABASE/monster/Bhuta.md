# Bhuta

When sapient creatures die violently in a natural setting or a location infused with primal magic, they sometimes rise as a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghost|ghostlike]] undead called a bhuta. Resembling a translucent version of their mortal form, only shadowless and with backward feet, a bhuta's lust for vengeance or unquenchable desire to complete an unfinished task poisons the natural world, turning animals into agents of the bhuta's corrupted will. However, a bhuta's connection to their mortal life is weak and vague, more a series of compulsions and triggers than the torturous recollections of a ghost. Thus, while a bhuta might start by hunting down and devouring those who slew their mortal form, they find no relief and soon turn to predation through their domain.

**Bound** Bhutas are bound to a natural area or feature where they died and must remain within 120 feet of that anchor. A bhuta can only leave if invited to travel with living companions, an invitation bhutas often seek to obtain via trickery. While traveling, the bhuta must remain within 120 feet of at least one of the living creatures who invited them. If all members of the group die, the bhuta must return to their bound area by midnight the same day or be destroyed.
**Shadowless** A bhuta casts no shadow.

###  Bunking with Bhutas

Most often, bhutas ingratiate themselves with living travelers through deception, using their influence over animals to appear trustworthy, then picking their prey off one by one in secret. However, a few stories exist of bhutas finding true friendship among the living and, through it, attaining a measure of peace that allows them to pass on.
