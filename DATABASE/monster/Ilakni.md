These tendrils begin siphoning away the target's mind to make them an empty vessel, ready to be inhabited by Osoyo in the future. The target must attempt a DC 30 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Siphon Mind for 24 hours.
 **Success** The target takes 3d6 mental damage.
 **Failure** The target takes 6d6 mental damage and becomes [[Stupefied]], or increases its stupefied value by 1 to a maximum of stupefied 4. If the creature dies as a result of this mental damage, its body remains alive while its mind and soul move on. The body can remain alive without its soul and mind for many years, as long as it is cared for. If Osoyo escapes from its prison, a body in this state becomes animated by Osoyo's will, transforming into an entity with the same statistics as Ilakni but directly controlled by the Blackfrost Whale. If the body is restored to life before this event, this development can be avoided.
 **Critical Failure** As critical failure, but 12d6 mental damage and stupefied 2 (or increases its stupefied value by 2, to a maximum of 4).</span>
