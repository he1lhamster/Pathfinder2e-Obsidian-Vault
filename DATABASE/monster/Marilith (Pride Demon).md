# Marilith (Pride Demon)

Mariliths are the generals of the Abyss, formed from the souls of proud evil mortals, often warlords and despots. They appear as tall and powerfully built humans from the waist up with snake tails and six arms. Because of Lamashtu’s prominence over other demonic deities, most pride demons encountered by mortals take female form, but they can be of any gender.
 Mariliths are among the greatest tacticians in the Abyss, and they have an almost supernatural knack for understanding the ripples of chaos and the unpredictable nature of demonic life. Their ability to command armies rises as much from their commanding presence as it does their ability to read into the potential results of any possible act and a sufficient understanding of the flow of entropy to allow them to predict likely outcomes.

The demon makes a longsword Strike. On a successful attack, the marilith deals longsword damage to the target, plus an additional 1d8 damage for every longsword they wield beyond the first (typically 5d8 extra damage). Even on a failed attack, the marilith deals the damage from one longsword to the target, though they still miss completely on a critical failure. This counts toward the marilith’s multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of longswords the pride demon wields.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Greater Constrict|Greater Constrict]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> 2d12+13 bludgeoning, DC 39</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Infuse Weapons** (divine, evocation) Any weapon becomes a _+2 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|greater striking]] weapon_ made of cold iron and silver while a marilith wields it.
