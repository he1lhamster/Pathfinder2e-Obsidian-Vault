description: 'Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great
  pride in their power to curse precious objects. They hold grudges and create convoluted
  plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as when a creature dares to
  remove one of their curses. Rarely content to wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also
  take immense pleasure in torture and murder, though they prefer to lead victims
  into traps designed to capture or incapacitate rather than kill outright. Deep pits
  are favorites, since victims who survive the fall face a slow death from starvation
  and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall

# Jitterbone

Aptly named jitterbones, [[DATABASE/ancestry/Halfling|halfling]] mortics are capable of controlling the density and rigidity of their skeletal structure. When relaxed, they have elongated, rubbery limbs. When they harden their bones, they become difficult to harm and bony spikes jut from their flesh.

The jitterbone gains the undead trait and becomes immune to bleed, death effects, disease, [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], poison, and sleep. Any such effects the jitterbone is currently inflicted with are suspended but take effect again once they take a breath. Death Gasp lasts as long as the jitterbone holds their breath (up to 8 rounds).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Osseous Defense** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, transmutation) The jitterbone elongates their bones, causing jagged bone spikes to protrude from their skin. While Osseous Defense is active, the jitterbone can make bone spike and bone dart Strikes (see below) and gains resistance 5 to piercing damage and slashing damage. The jitterbone loses Compression while their Osseous Defense is active. The jitterbone can end Osseous Defense as a single action, retracting their bones back into their body.
