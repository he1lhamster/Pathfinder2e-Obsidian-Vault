# Elder Wyrmwraith

The most powerful of these monsters, elder wyrmwraiths, sometimes form spontaneously from legendary dragons haunted by an irrational fear of the afterlife, but most have simply existed for over a thousand years, growing in power all the while.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, necromancy, negative) The wyrmwraith unleashes a burst of negative energy that deals 24d6 negative damage to all creatures in a 90-foot cone (DC 46 basic Reflex save). They can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Consume Souls** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, death, incapacitation, necromancy) The elder wyrmwraith inhales sharply, sucking in the souls of nearby creatures. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must attempt a DC 46 Will save. The elder wyrmwraith can't Consume Souls again for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]]. 
**Failure** The creature becomes doomed 2 and takes 100 negative damage. 
**Critical Failure** The creature is slain. As long as the wyrmwraith still exists, the slain creature can't be returned to life through any means.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Divine Dispelling** (abjuration, divine) A wyrmwraith's claws rend divine magic. Whenever a wyrmwraith hits a creature with a spectral claws Strike, the wyrmwraith can attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] check to counteract an ongoing divine spell effect on the creature.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Draconic Frenzy** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The wyrmwraith makes two claw Strikes and one jaws Strike in any order.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Drain Life** (divine, necromancy) When a wyrmwraith deals damage to a living creature with a spectral jaws or spectral claw Strike, the wyrmwraith gains 24 temporary Hit Points, and the creature must succeed at a DC 46 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]]. Further damage dealt by the wyrmwraith's spectral jaws or spectral claws Strikes increases the value of the drained condition by 2 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Ectoplasmic Form** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, necromancy) A wyrmwraith can push through the ectoplasmic veil to temporarily assume a physical form made of ectoplasm. The wyrmwraith loses the incorporeal trait for 1d4 rounds, though they can return to their incorporeal form as a free action before then. Once this ability ends, the wyrmwraith can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds. While in their ectoplasmic form, the wyrmwraith's AC increases to 52 and they gain 125 temporary Hit Points. They lose their immunity to precision damage and all of their resistances. Their melee Strikes deal slashing and piercing damage, respectively, instead of negative damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Phase Lurch** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, move) **Requirements** The wyrmwraith is in their ectoplasmic form; **Effect** As the Stride action, but the wyrmwraith can pass through walls or material obstacles as though they were incorporeal. They must begin and end their movement outside of any physical obstacles, and passing through solid material is difficult terrain</span>
