# Mummy, Drowned

Rarely artificially created, drowned mummies are miserable, dripping undead that have adapted to exist in an aquatic environment, usually over centuries, after their tomb or lair becomes flooded.

###  Environmental Adaptations

Mummies are resolute, refusing to abandon their tombs, burial sites, or lairs regardless of the changes wrought to these locations through the ages. Over the centuries, this stubbornness drives adaptation and innovation, resulting in mummies closely tied to their environments— no matter how weird!
