# Mudwretch

In its resting form, a mudwretch looks like a large puddle of thick, dark mud, heaped at the center in a slightly drier patch of loam. When a living creature approaches, though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy flesh upon itself to form a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching creature's general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself.
 Mudwretches possess a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements. They have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch dries out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood from living creatures has to do—a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders than one that's comfortably wallowing on a river bank.

###  Mudwretch Lifestyles

Mudwretches are rarely encountered alone. They inhabit swampy patches in small groups, often gathering near the ruins of sites that once held great significance. Mudwretches can remain dormant for centuries, always eager to lurch up to attack passersby. They're usually more interested in defending territory than killing intruders, and they won't pursue victims for long if they flee.
