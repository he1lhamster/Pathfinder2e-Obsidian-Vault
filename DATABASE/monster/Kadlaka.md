# Kadlaka

Kadlakas—strong, lanky humanoids with raven-like features—combine the most formidable aspects of talented hunters and airborne scouts, to say nothing of their potent magical powers over thunder and lightning. Though they shy from most humanoids, kadlakas readily form friendships with ravens and other birds, and they sometimes make temporary alliances with people who prove themselves capable stewards of wild animals and the natural order of things. When they do settle on a roost—whether for a single season or a lifetime—kadlakas often position themselves as guardians of a natural feature or local flock. Because a kadlaka's natural form might frighten humanoid travelers, they often take on the guise of a human or other common bipedal ancestry to gain information and pass on warnings.

<span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The kadlaka can change their appearance to that of a Medium humanoid. This doesn't change their Speed or their attack and damage modifiers with their Strikes but might change the type of damage their melee Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). While in their humanoid shape, the kadlaka can't use Wingbeat. Each kadlaka has a fixed humanoid form—they can't adopt a different appearance each time they use this ability.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Silent Lightning** (illusion, primal) A kadlaka's movements are practically silent. Against a creature using only hearing to perceive them, they gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check. As normal, this benefit also improves the kadlaka's Stealth DC.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wingbeat** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (evocation, primal, sonic) The kadlaka beats their wings with a mighty peal of thunder. Creatures in a 15-foot emanation take 5d6 sonic damage (DC 21 basic Fortitude save). On a failed save, the creature is also pushed 5 feet away from the kadlaka. The kadlaka can't use Wingbeat again for 1d4 rounds.</span>

###  Kadlaka Feathers

Kadlakas occasionally gift their feathers as tokens of friendship and esteem or to repay a debt of honor. This gift is usually a single feather, but it's no insignificant thing—a kadlaka's primary flight feathers can be as long as a human's arm, and once gifted, a feather doesn't grow back. Even more impressively, kadlakas can weave one of their feathers into a headband or [[DATABASE/equipment/Raven Band|armband]] to imbue it with magical properties.
