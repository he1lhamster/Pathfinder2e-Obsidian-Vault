###  Secret Mongers

Nalfeshnees covet knowledge as well as material goods, especially if such information can help satisfy the needs and desires of the [[Abyss]]. Each nalfeshnee has areas of interest in which they're highly knowledgeable, but before a nalfeshnee reveals a secret, they typically demand a secret of at least equal value in return.
