# Augur

These spherical knots of sinewy muscle, serrated blades, and bloody metal are the most common velstracs on the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]]. Each augur has only a single eye, from which they can see the horrors inflicted by other velstracs, who train the augur to expect and appreciate pain. Augurs are 1 foot in diameter and weigh 30 pounds.
