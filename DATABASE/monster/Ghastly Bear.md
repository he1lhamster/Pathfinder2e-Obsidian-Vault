**Stench** (aura, olfactory) 10 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (plus, on a critical failure, [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] as long as it's sickened). While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
