# Mechanical Carny

Mechanical carnies are constructs manufactured to serve as entertainers, cleaners, and guards at carnivals and circuses. The first of these constructs was created by a gnome inventor who yearned for a tireless companion who could make her laugh and smile. Her invention was so successful that it has spawned countless imitations and knockoffs throughout the Inner Sea, and mechanical carnies of some form or another are a staple throughout metropolitan lands in both Avistan and Garund.

## Other Mechanical Carnies

The statistics here represent a relatively simple mechanical carny; the extravagance and range of a mechanical carny’s abilities are limited only by the skill and imagination of its creator. To represent other kinds of mechanical carnies, you can swap out the mechanical carny’s Berserk and Berserk Slam abilities with one of the following.
 **Bounce Back** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Requirement** The mechanical carny takes damage from a melee attack; **Effect** The mechanical carny wobbles violently to and fro, making two headbutt Strikes: the first against the creature (if any) on the opposite side of itself from the creature that triggered this reaction and the second against the creature that triggered this reaction.
 **Spring-Loaded Jump** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (move) The mechanical carny leaps up to 25 feet into the air and lands within 25 feet (or a distance equal to the height of the carny’s jump, if fewer) of where it started, taking no falling damage.
 **Water Cannon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (water) The mechanical carny sprays a 15-foot cone of water, dealing 2d6+4 nonlethal bludgeoning to creatures in the area (DC 18 basic Reflex save) and extinguishing any non-magical fires.
**Recall Knowledge - Construct ([[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]])**: DC 16
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 14
**Specific Lore**: DC 11

<span class="in-box-ability">**Haywire** A severely damaged mechanical carny has a chance of malfunctioning. If a mechanical carny has 15 or fewer Hit Points at the start of its turn, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or go haywire. A haywire mechanical carny wildly attacks the nearest living creature, or the nearest object if no creatures are nearby. It takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Strikes but deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus [[DATABASE/monsterability/Knockdown|Knockdown]]. This effect lasts 10 minutes or until the mechanical carny is destroyed.</span>

###  Creating Mechanical Carnies

Constructing a mechanical carny is a difficult feat and requires the supervision of a specialized (and expensive) tinkerer. A thrifty ringmaster may employ a budget-level tinkerer and mechanical carny, though they get what they pay for; many a cheap troupe leader has found a malfunctioning mechanical carny wreaking havoc in their circus tent.
