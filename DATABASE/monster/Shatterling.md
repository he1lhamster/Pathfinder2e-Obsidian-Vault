# Shatterling

Shatterlings have a fixation on mirrors that gives them a strange affinity for reflective surfaces. These creeping, wicked fey stand barely 3 feet high and look like hunched humanoids made of shifting panes of jagged mirror glass. Shatterlings usually inhabit areas with plenty of mirrors, like carnival fun houses, opulent manors, or playhouses. Capricious and malevolent, shatterlings quickly kill or scare away anyone else in such areas, as they desire to be the only ones to gaze into the mirrors they claim as their own.

###  Drawn to Mirrors

A half-dimension exists just behind mirrors in the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], although scholars disagree whether it's a plane of its own or simply a strange reflection of the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] or [[DATABASE/plane/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]]. In any event, shatterlings sometimes see this realm when they leap through mirrors but can never reach it, an inaccessibility that fuels their hatred. Many shatterlings spend their days leaping between mirrors, hoping to catch elusive glimpses of the mirrorworld they will never touch.
