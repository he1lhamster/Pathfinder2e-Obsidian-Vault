# Red-Hooded Thatchling

When a soul doomed to become a thatchling dies in the throes of great anguish, they can return after death as a red-hooded thatchling. These vengeful thatchlings appear to wear red hoods when viewed at a distance, but up close, the grisly truth—that their heads are blood-soaked—is revealed. Unlike other thatchlings, red-hooded thatchlings are skilled at trickery, and their ability to appear as a living humanoid through illusion magic allows them to lure the unexpected into ambushes much more easily.

A thatchling is always permanently destroyed if reduced to 0 Hit Points by fire damage or if the obstacle preventing the soul from reincarnating is removed.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Create Thatchling Spawn** (necromancy, occult) A living humanoid who's slain by a red-hooded thatchling while under the effects of Thatchling's Curse rises as a thatchling after 1d4 rounds. This spawn is under the command of the red-hooded thatchling that killed it. If a red-hooded thatchling controls too many at once (as determined by the GM), some thatchlings can free themselves with a DC 18 Will saving throw at the start of their turn. If the red-hooded thatchling who created the spawn is destroyed, the spawn becomes an autonomous thatchling.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Howl of Vengeful Fury** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (necromancy, occult, sonic Frequency once per hour) **Effect** The red-hooded thatchling sobs pitifully before unleashing a terrifying scream. All non-thatchling creatures within a 30-foot emanation take 2d10 sonic damage (DC 18 basic Fortitude save) and become immune to all thatchlings' distracting giggle for 1 minute. Thatchlings in the area gain 5 temporary Hit Points and a +1 status bonus to their Strikes and saving throws for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Thatchling's Curse** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (curse, enchantment, mental, occult) The thatchling focuses its attention on a single target within 30 feet that it can see, and then begins muttering and whispering nonsense. The target must attempt a DC 18 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Thatchling's Curse for 24 hours.
 **Success** The target is momentarily disoriented and has difficulty moving in the right direction. The target takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
 **Failure** As success, but the penalty to its Speeds lasts for 1 minute.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty to its Speeds lasts until the curse is removed or until the thatchling that created the effect is permanently destroyed, whichever comes first. In addition, when the cursed creature attempts a [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]] or [[DATABASE/action/Track|Track]], they use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of their check, and they can't take the [[DATABASE/action/Scout|Scout]] exploration activity.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Thicket Walker** Thatchlings ignore difficult terrain caused by brambles, tangled grass, and undergrowth, even those manipulated by magic.</span>
