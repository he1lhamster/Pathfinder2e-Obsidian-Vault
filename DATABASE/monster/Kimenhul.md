# Kimenhul

Among the strongest of their kind aside from the sahkil tormentors, kimenhuls work their craft to foment despair in those who fear failure, forming cycles of self-loathing. These powerful sahkils focus their attention on mortals who are seemingly at the peak of their ability yet harbor secret fears of inadequacy. A kimenhul's predations can leave an indelible mark on its victims. The kimenhul whispers threats and sends fears of crushing failure to its prey, seemingly originating from their own minds, a trauma that can be difficult to bear without help. These sahkils torment their prey as long as the hapless victims live, using their Eternal Fear ability every day to psychically remind their previous victims of their failings.
 Some unique kimenhuls find themselves in a position of leadership in Xibalba (see the sidebar below), where they carve out their own small kingdoms and direct groups of sahkils to help them find mortals to torment. They rule these nightmare kingdoms through terror, often delighting in tormenting new petitioners or scheming ways to work against their immortal foes.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Eternal Fear** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental) The kimenhul contorts its faces and presents itself to its enemies in a terrifying and traumatic display that causes lingering fear. Each creature within 100 feet that can observe the kimenhul must make a DC 42 Will save. They are then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Success** The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 3]]. 
**Failure** The target becomes frightened 3 and is [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] as long as it's frightened. Even after recovering from the initial experience, the trauma is lodged in the target's mind for 1 year. Once per day, the kimenhul can communicate telepathically with the target for 1 minute as long as both creatures are on the same plane. Any time a creature under the effect of Eternal Fear is in a stressful situation (such as combat or intense social pressure), they must succeed at a DC 11 flat check or become frightened 2. While Eternal Fear lasts, the target always becomes fleeing as long as it's frightened, regardless of the source of the fear. The target can attempt a new saving throw each week to remove these effects, but they can otherwise be removed only by powerful magic such as [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]]. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the effects are permanent and the target doesn't get to attempt a weekly save to end the effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Frightening Flurry** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The kimenhul makes one jaws Strike and two claw Strikes against a single target, in any order. The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] with a condition value equal to the number of Strikes that hit it, to a maximum of frightened 3 if all three Strikes hit.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Rend|Rend]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Skip Between** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (conjuration, divine, teleportation) The sahkil moves from the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] to the [[DATABASE/plane/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]] or vice-versa, with the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Ethereal Jaunt|ethereal jaunt]] except that the effect has an unlimited duration and can be Dismissed.
