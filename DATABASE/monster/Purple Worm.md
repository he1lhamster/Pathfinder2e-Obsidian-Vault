# Purple Worm

The purple worm is the most common and infamous of the cave worms, a much-feared monster wandering the twisting tunnels of the Darklands that is capable of carving out entire cave systems. Tunnels bored by a purple worm don’t always last long after these creature’s passage, and areas where they nest are maddening mazes of passageways that lead nowhere, yet navigating the labyrinth to find the worm’s central nest often yields amazing treasures left behind by the worm’s prior victims.

The Strike deals bludgeoning damage depending on the size of the projectile: Tiny deals 2d6+13, Small 3d6+13, Medium 4d6+13, Large 5d6+13, and Huge 6d6+13. A regurgitated creature takes falling damage from the height of the target or from 20 feet, whichever is greater.
Boulders occupy space in the worm’s stomach as a creature of equivalent size, and purple worms often have several boulders swallowed. A purple worm can use a single action to swallow a new boulder.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rock Tunneler** A purple worm can burrow through solid stone at a Speed of 20 feet. It can leave a tunnel if it desires, and it usually does.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Huge, 3d6+9 bludgeoning, Rupture 24</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Thrash** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The worm makes a Strike once against each creature in its reach. It can Strike up to once with its jaws, up to once with its stinger, and any number of times with its body. Each attack counts toward the worm’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all the attacks.</span>
