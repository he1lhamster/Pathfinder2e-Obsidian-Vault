# Quantium Golem

The long war between Nex and Geb spawned many animate weapons, but while a citizen of Quantium might run screaming from any product of the fleshforges, they barely bat an eyelash at the ground-shaking stomp of the two titanic, deadly constructs that stride outside their city walls. Crafted by the wizard-king Nex ages ago after a devastating attack by Geb's undead forces, including the harrowing benthic reaver, the Quantium golems are meant to protect the capital in case of Nex's absence. These twin golems ceaselessly keep vigil over the city, ready to cut down any invaders that menace Quantium.
 Twenty feet tall and crafted from a supernaturally smooth material, the two guardians are a matched set, one of crimson and one of emerald. Wielding swords the size of giants, the guardians relentlessly destroy anything that threatens the city, particularly any undead that might invade the country from Geb. With the mythic Crux of Nex as a power supply, the golems are inexhaustible and nearly indestructible.

###  Eternal Patrol

The pair of golems remain within 1 mile of Quantium, walking a constant circuit counterclockwise around the city. The golems position themselves to remain at opposite ends of the city, and they only pause in their rounds if attacked or obstructed. The golems take the most direct approach to eliminating hindrances.
