description: 'Interlocutors are the most talented surgeon-sculptors of the velstracs,
  carving away flesh and replacing it with new body parts of muscle, sinew, and metal.
  Each interlocutor structures their individual appearance carefully, but all are
  towering, multi-limbed amalgamations of the strongest limbs, densest bone, and sharpest
  metal they can find. They continually search for new material to graft to their
  forms, and their slain foes are rarely found intact, as little is more valuable
  to interlocutors than a powerful opponent''s legs, eyes, or even brain. Interlocutors

# Invidiak (Shadow Demon)

For most demons, possessing a creature requires a ritual, magic item, or condition, but for invidiaks, who lack a body, possession is akin to donning a suit of clothing. Known also as shadow demons, invidiaks are formed from envious mortal souls.
