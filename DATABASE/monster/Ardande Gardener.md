###  First World Ardande

Some ardandes are born in the [[First World]], the children of [[Dryad]] who take mortal lovers. These ardandes have little contact with other mortals and think of themselves as elemental fey rather than planar scions, a reasonable perspective when life in the First World means severance from the River of Souls.
