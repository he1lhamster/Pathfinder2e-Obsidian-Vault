# Xulgath Gutrager

Xulgath gutragers exhibit more extreme developments along the same physiological path as their [[DATABASE/monster/Xulgath Bilebearer|bilebearer]] cousins. They are stockier and faster, with necks and limbs corded with muscle. They are also denser, with multiple stomachs full of fluids even more caustic than those of the bilebearer. Like the bilebearer, gutragers lack the distinctive stench typical of most xulgaths.
 A gutrager’s torso conceals its most disturbing feature—a densely coiled esophagus. Pressurized bladders and a muscular throat allow the gutrager to propel its esophagus outward in an explosion of yellow flesh and acidic bile; caustic stomach acid coating the esophagus makes even brief physical contact with the organ dangerous. As a last resort, the gutrager can intentionally accelerate the corrosion in its esophagus, releasing vile acid in a burst that also ends its life.

###  Gutrager Origins

Gutragers have been part of xulgath society for millennia. One xulgath legend suggests that xulgaths developed the material-strengthening art of inflection in order to safeguard clutch walls from gutragers’ powerful acid. Gutrager acid is also used to etch designs onto xulgath scales and, in difficult times, can be carefully used in place of fire to cook food.
