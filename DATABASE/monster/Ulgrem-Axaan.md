### Alternate Abilities

Rumors run rampant about the most mysterious and unique beings on Golarion, and any scholar who makes assumptions can easily be blindsided by reality. The following are a number of alternate abilities that Ulgrem-Axaan might possess; GMs choosing to use one of these abilities can replace one of Ulgrem-Axaan's abilities in the stat block above.
 **Crocodile Tears** Ulgrem-Axaan can mimic the sound of a wounded prey animal by attempting a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]]. It has a +4 circumstance bonus to this check.
 **Befouling Odor** (aura, olfactory) 15 feet. Creatures entering or starting their turn in the emanation must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (sickened 2 on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to befouling odor for 1 minute.
 **Ichor Coating** (disease) Beneath the plates of bone and ice on Ulgrem-Axaan flow the viscous remains of its vital fluids. Creatures coming into physical contact with this fluid must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or become infected with [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghoul|ghoul fever]].
 **Crushing Weight** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** Ulgrem-Axaan has a creature [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] with its tail; **Effect** Ulgrem-Axaan's tail clamps down around the creature, dealing 2d4+8 bludgeoning damage (DC 25 basic Fortitude save).
 **Fallen Victim** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (attack) **Requirements** A creature in Ulgrem-Axaan's reach is [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]], and Ulgrem-Axaan isn't currently grabbing another creature; **Effect** Ulgrem-Axaan attempts a jaws Strike against the creature. If successful, Ulgrem-Axaan immediately [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grabs]] the creature, and the creature takes an additional 2d10 bludgeoning damage.
 **Ichor Trail** Any square Ulgrem-Axaan moves into is coated in melting liquids from its body and becomes difficult terrain. After an hour, the ichor dries and the effect ends.
