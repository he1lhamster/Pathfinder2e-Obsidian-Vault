# Bebilith

While [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demons]] control much of the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]], even they are hunted in the wilder regions of this horrific plane. The most notorious of these predators—though not the deadliest—is the bebilith. These fiends resemble elephant-sized spiders with glowing eyes, barbed chitin, and a fanged maw dripping caustic fluid.
Many demons and planar travelers have underestimated bebiliths' devious intellects, believing them to be little more than oversized vermin. Bebiliths take advantage of this, ambushing foes with unexpected tactics. While they lash out at any creatures they encounter, they take great pleasure in chewing on demonic flesh. [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Qlippoth|Qlippoth]] are the only creatures bebiliths never consume.

###  Adaptive Hunters

Though it doesn't happen often due to their ability to shift planes, some bebiliths find themselves trapped on other planes either through magical binding or subjugation to beings of great power. While trapped away from their favored prey, a bebilith's hungers can shift. In such cases, the creature's penetrating strikes can adapt—a bebilith trapped in [[DATABASE/plane/Elysium|Elysium]], for example, might become a hunter of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Azata|azatas]], and its Penetrating Strike would count as cold iron and evil instead so that it could target traditional azata weaknesses.
