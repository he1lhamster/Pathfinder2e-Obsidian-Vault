description: 'A coral capuchin resembles a hairless pink monkey with large eyes and
  batlike wings. Something of a tropical nuisance, these amphibious creatures follow
  trade ships, hoping to filch small valuables they can take home or perhaps find
  a sailor they can befriend to secure a regular supply of food.<br/><br/> Coral capuchins
  live in tropical climates, and while they can breathe water or air with equal ease,
  their membranous skin means they rely heavily on having a nearby source of water.
  Fresh- and saltwater serve equally well for this purpose, though the creatures generally
  congregate near oceans and seas for other reasons. Jungles, islands, and warm coastlines
  are their most common nesting sites, though they usually hide their nests high in
  trees or in other locations out of easy reach of predators, scavengers, or anything
  that might steal the trinkets they''ve collected.<br/><br/> These little flyers
  are insatiably curious, and they love to follow humanoids around. Capuchins largely
  agree that humanoids have the best food and trinkets. Smarter than animals and capable
  of rudimentary speech, the creatures can be quite useful with the right training,
  learning how seek out sunken treasures or hunt down rats and other pests on a ship.
  Some spellcasters residing along tropical coastlines have taken coral capuchins
  as familiars, though many claim the critters as far more trouble than any benefits
  they provide are worth. A capuchin familiar might pilfer spellcasting components,
  gemstones, vials, crafting materials, and other trinkets from their master, though
  a clever magic user will intersperse more appealing (and less valuable) baubles
  to draw their familiar''s attention away from actually important items.<br/><br/>
  Capuchin clans live together under a single matriarch, a slightly larger female
  who can be identified by her unusually prismatic skin and colorful eyes. These females
  refuse to be tamed or kept as pets and violently resist all forms of capture. The
  most powerful among them even possess divine powers which they call upon to protect
  their homes and kin. In return, the remainder of the clan fights fiercely to protect
  their matriarch, defending her (and her trinkets) from threats far larger than themselves.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall

# Cornugon (Horned Devil)

[[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell's]] armies contain legions upon legions of different devils all suited precisely to their roles. But such an army needs able commanders, and it is this role that cornugons fill. Their mere presence inspires those under their command to improved performance— often through fear of the horrible torments that a cornugon can unleash as punishment for failure. Forged in the fires of Malebolge from the most renowned warriors among lesser devilkind, even the least cornugon is among the fiercest warriors of the multiverse. The greatest among them on occasion ascend further still, becoming those rare and feared legends of Hell called malebranche.

###  The Malebranche

Every 5,000 years, the mightiest cornugon becomes a malebranche, a quasi-deity below infernal dukes. Scholars on Golarion currently know of 12 active malebranche, and while each is unique, all share the goal of conquering the Material Plane.
