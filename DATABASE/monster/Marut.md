# Marut

A marut is tasked with hunting mortals who cheat death by artificially extending their lifespans. This includes those who seek undeath, such as liches and vampires, but also includes those who use powerful magic to cling to their youth, use divination to discover and avoid an appointed death, or call too often on the power of resurrection. Once the marut has selected its target, the inevitable pursues its quarry without surcease or deviation until either it or the target is dead.
 Maruts seem to be carved from stone and clad in golden armor, yet they move with the deliberate grace of a creature made of flesh and bone. A marut never rushes, but its thunderous footfalls are relentless as it pursues its target. Though able to speak any language, the marut is taciturn even among inevitables.

###  Psychopomp Allies

The mandate of marut inevitables is similar to that of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomps]]. Generally, the practical psychopomps are content to let an unyielding marut complete its mission and swoop in afterward to ensure the work has been done, but occasionally, they may work together.
