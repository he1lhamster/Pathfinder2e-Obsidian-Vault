The sun-spire attempts to counteract the triggering spell with a +22 counteract bonus. If it successfully counteracts the spell, the sun-spire's sunlight stores are empowered. While empowered, the sun-spire deals an additional 2d8 fire damage with all of its attacks and abilities. The sun-spire remains empowered until the end of its next turn.</span>

It fires the beam in a 120-foot line, dealing 11d8 fire damage to all creatures in the line (DC 33 basic Reflex save). The concentrated beam ignites everything in its path, including the air, creating a wall of burning flame along the line that continues to burn until the end of the sun-spire's next turn. This wall has the effects of a 5th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Fire|wall of fire]] spell, dealing 5d6 fire damage to any creature that crosses the wall or occupies the wall's area at the start of its turn. The sun-spire can't use the Beam of the Seven Suns again for 1d4 rounds, although rounds it's not in sunlight don't count toward this number.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Trample|Trample]]** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Large or smaller, arm, DC 33</span>
