# Vilderavn

In their true form, a vilderavn is a great raven with a wingspan of 6–8 feet. Adaptable shapeshifters, they can change to the fighting forms of a snarling wolf, a hybrid of both wolf and raven, and a tall humanoid in black armor with a massive greatsword. More sinister is their ability to assume a humanoid guise suited to insinuate themselves into the retinues of boastful mortal rulers. With historical knowledge and clever rumor-mongering, they goad the proud into squabbles, feuds, and ultimately wars. The vilderavn stays at the ruler's side until victory is within grasp, the war almost won, then exacts the cruel stroke of betrayal. Their magic turns the mortals against each other, and the vilderavn's sword falls swiftly.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bloodbird** (curse, occult) A creature hit by a vilderavn's melee attack becomes cursed. It takes 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] that's difficult to stanch.

The vilderavn can only use their jaws attack when in a form with a wolf's head, and their talon attack in a form with raven qualities. They can instead assume their raven knight form: a Medium humanoid in black [[DATABASE/armor/Full Plate|full plate]] carrying a [[DATABASE/weapon/Greatsword|greatsword]]. They can use their jaws or talon Strikes only in a form that has that body part, and their greatsword only in knight form.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Souleater** (necromancy, occult) If the vilderavn kills a humanoid target with a critical hit using their jaws Strike, they rip out and devour the target's heart and soul as part of the attack. While the target is dead, the vilderavn can [[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]] into the target's form, gaining a +4 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to impersonate the target. If magic would resurrect the creature, the caster must succeed at a DC 34 counteract check to extract the target's soul from the vilderavn; otherwise, the spell fails.</span>

###  Creation of the Vildravns

Legends say vilderavns were created by a fey lord as a weapon against those who ruined the land with their iron armaments. Vilderavns would exploit the hubris of mortals and devour their souls after death. With this goal, the vilderavns hid in various forms to watch and learn human ways, and executed their calling with great subtlety but no mercy. No mortal knows if this legend is true or spread by vilderavns to imply a purpose for their heartless cruelty.
