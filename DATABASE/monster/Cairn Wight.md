# Cairn Wight

Jealous guardians of tombs, barrows, and sepulchers, cairn wights usually spawn from necromantic rituals. For those mortals who cannot abide the thought of separation from their earthly possessions, the undead existence offered by transformation into a cairn wight can be tempting. Perhaps as frequently, particularly avaricious and wealthy royalty or merchants seek out victims to transform into cairn wights to guard their precious wealth for all time.
 Only in the rarest instances is the greed of a mortal strong enough to spontaneously transform them into a cairn wight without a dark ritual or the intercession of a powerful divine being. On those occasions, however, the resultant wight exhibits unmatched viciousness and likely owns rare treasure indeed.
 As guardians of material possessions, cairn wights are supernaturally bound to the armaments they wore during the ritual used to create them. They can spread their necromantic powers into the weapons they wield. A slash from a cairn wight's sword channels life from the victim into the wight.

###  Cairn Wight Dirges

Unlike a typical wight, cairn wights have an unusual affinity for music. The lyrics of their dirges often contain a valuable bit of knowledge or long-lost lore, possibly the greatest treasure a cairn wight guards. There are even brave souls who seek out the creatures to listen to their songs in hopes of finding profit from the dry, rasping words.
