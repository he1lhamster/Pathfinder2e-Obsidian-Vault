# Aluum Enforcer

The most common aluum is powered by the bound soul of a loyal city servant, but its creation is among the Pactmasters’ most guarded secrets. There are dozens of dormant aluums spread throughout Katapesh, and only someone wearing an aluum charm can activate and command one of these 14-foot-tall soldiers. The Pactmasters entrust few beyond the Zephyr Guard to carry these charms, and stealing such a charm is one of the most severe crimes in the city.
