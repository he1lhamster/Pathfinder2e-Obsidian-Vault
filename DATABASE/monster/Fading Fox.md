# Fading Fox

With fur that shifts between hues of red, dull brown, and silver as it moves, the fading fox vexes any pursuer. It has a knack for escaping traps, leaves no footprints, and seemingly disappears into thin air. Fading foxes have lustrous fur and a robust build that set them apart from their red fox progenitors.
