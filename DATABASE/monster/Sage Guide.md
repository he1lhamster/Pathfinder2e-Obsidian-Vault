# Sage Guide

Sage spirit guides are among the wisest spirits. They often take the forms of raptors such as owls, using their keen senses to evaluate situations from high above before swooping in to aid imperiled mortals.
 Adventurers who befriend a sage guide are fortunate indeed; in addition to providing sage counsel before conflict begins, sage guides can restore and tend to their allies in the aftermath of a violent dispute.
 In many stories, the sage guide assumes the form of a large owl whose proud breast is composed of hard stone. This depiction combines the wisdom commonly attributed to the owl with the strength and fortitude of the earth.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bond with Mortal** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (mental, necromancy, primal) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The spirit guide forms a bond with a mortal creature. While the bond exists, the spirit guide's current and maximum Hit Points increase by 14, the spirit guide gains a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the spirit guide and bonded mortal can communicate telepathically as long as they're on the same plane. The spirit guide can be bonded with only one mortal at a time, and can take this action again to end the bond or to form a new bond (which also ends the old bond). The bond ends if the spirit guide or the mortal dies.
 This bond strengthens the spirit guide's connection to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]. While bonded, the spirit guide loses the incorporeal and spirit traits, loses their immunities and resistances, and changes their Strikes to deal the appropriate physical damage (typically piercing or slashing) instead of force damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Bonded Strike** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirements** The spirit guide is currently Bonded with a Mortal; **Effect** The spirit guide makes a talon Strike.
