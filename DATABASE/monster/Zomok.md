# Zomok

Mighty plant-dragons, zomoks prowl the woodlands, defending their homes from destructive forces while healing and restoring the woods following natural disasters and ravaging intruders. Zomoks vary in appearance with the seasons, growing verdant green in the spring and summer, changing to autumnal colors in the fall, and decaying to brown in winter. While zomoks can and often do swallow their foes, they have no real need to eat. Any creature they gulp down is typically left behind as a mangled corpse the next time the zomok travels via their Forest Step ability. Zomoks reach 35 to 40 feet in length and weigh 30 tons.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Entombing Breath** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (conjuration, earth, primal) The zomok blasts forth a 60-foot cone of earth and gravel, dealing 17d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 34 basic Reflex save); [[Prone]] creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to this saving throw. Creatures touching the ground that fail their saves take a 10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds and are [[Restrained]] ([[Escape]] DC 34) on a critical failure. The zomok can't use Entombing Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
 The bodies of creatures slain by Entombing Breath instantly decompose and are destroyed—they can be restored to life only by a 7th-level or higher spell or ritual that restores life.

The zomok regains 10d10 Hit Points during this teleportation. Creatures swallowed by the zomok are left behind.

###  Zomoks' Primal Call

Zomoks can use [[Primal Call]] without needing any secondary casters. The zomok typically calls an [[Awakened Tree]], [[Arboreal]], or [[Shambler]], and often tasks the called creature with guarding a sacred location, accompanying an ally on a mission for the good of the forest, or a similar assignment.
