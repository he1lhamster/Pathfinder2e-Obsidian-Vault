In addition, when a rust hag critically hits a target with a firearm, the target must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or be [[Stunned]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rusting Touch** A rust hag's touch causes metal to rapidly rust and corrode. If the hag succeeds at a Strike with her claw, she deals 2d6 damage (doubled on a critical hit) to a metal item the target is wearing or holding, ignoring its Hardness. If the hag hits an unattended metal item, the item takes this damage automatically. If a creature uses the [[Shield Block]] reaction with a metal shield against the hag's claw attack, the shield is automatically [[Broken]], but no other item is rusted on that attack. Objects made of skymetal, such as [[Adamantine]] and [[Orichalcum]], are immune to rusting touch.</span>

###  Rust Hag Guns

Rust hags use guns presented in _Pathfinder Guns & Gears_. The concussive and kickback weapon traits appear on page 150 of that book. If you don't want to use firearms in your campaign, then a rust hag's guns are so corroded they're valueless.
