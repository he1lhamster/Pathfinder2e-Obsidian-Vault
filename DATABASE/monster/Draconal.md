description: "Dragon agathions, known as draconals, number among the most powerful\
  \ of their kin, and also the wisest, embodying the wisdom of the benevolent philosopher-king.\
  \ With their wisdom comes an elevation above material matters, making them the most\
  \ removed from the troubles and lives of mortals. Draconals serve as the guardians\
  \ of powerful magic, and they dispense their wisdom in service of the greater good\
  \ of [[DATABASE/plane/Nirvana|Nirvana]] and the celestial planes.<br/><br/> Draconals\
  \ appear more draconic than humanoid. They walk on their hind legs and balance on\
  \ their long, serpent like tails. Sharp claws tip their scaled humanoid hands.<br/><br/>\
  \ Similar to true dragons, a draconal's coloration signifies different breath weapons,\
  \ traits, and resistances. Draconals also choose spells from one of four domains.\
  \ All have the options of the [[DATABASE/domain/Air Domain|air]] and [[DATABASE/domain/Healing\
  \ Domain|healing]] domains, but their color determines the other two. Black draconals\
  \ breathe and are resistant to fire, and their additional domain options are [[DATABASE/domain/Fire\
  \ Domain|fire]] and [[DATABASE/domain/Luck Domain|luck]] . Red draconals have the\
  \ same fire breath and resistance, but their additional domain options are [[DATABASE/domain/Protection\
  \ Domain|protection]] and [[DATABASE/domain/Sun Domain|sun]] . Green and white draconals\
  \ breathe and are resistant to cold, but green draconals have the options of [[DATABASE/domain/Nature\
  \ Domain|nature]] and [[DATABASE/domain/Water Domain|water]] domains while white\
  \ draconals have the options of [[DATABASE/domain/Freedom Domain|freedom]] and [[DATABASE/domain/Repose\
