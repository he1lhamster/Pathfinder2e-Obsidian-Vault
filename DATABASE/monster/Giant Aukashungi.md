<span class="in-box-ability">**Flippable** When flipped on its back, a giant aukashungi can’t move and its soft underbelly becomes exposed. Whenever a creature critically succeeds at a melee attack roll to Strike a giant aukashungi, the attacking creature can forgo the bonus damage to flip over the giant aukashungi (all other critical hit effects apply normally, such as critical specialization effects). While flipped over, the giant aukashungi can’t use reactions, can’t Stride or Strike, takes a –2 circumstance penalty to AC and saving throws, loses its resistances, and gains weakness 10 to physical damage. The aukashungi can right itself by using the Roll Up activity and then using an action to unroll.</span>

The aukashungi gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC while Rolled Up, but it cannot Stride or Strike, and it rolls downhill if on a slope. If the aukashungi is grappling a creature when it Rolls Up, that creature must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or become Swallowed Whole.
