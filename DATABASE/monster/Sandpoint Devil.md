# Sandpoint Devil

While some creatures have been fused to create a new entity that's graceful and beautiful, the Sandpoint Devil is the opposite. It has the hooves and body of a powerful horse, but it walks on its hind legs in a perverse parody of a humanoid gait. Its equine face has been distorted and elongated with skeletal, yellowed fangs and milky eyes. The pox-spotted hide along the creature's back bears a draconic tail with dark, spiny plates and two torn, bat-like wings.
 The legendary Sandpoint Devil appears only on moonless nights when mists gather around the coast. Most encounters end with missing livestock or children, with little left behind other than oddly placed hoofprints that reek of brimstone.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Accursed Breath** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (curse, evocation, fire, occult) The Sandpoint Devil breathes a 30-foot cone of flame that deals 6d10 fire damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 26 Reflex save. The Sandpoint Devil can't use Accursed Breath for 1d4 rounds. 
Critical Success The creature is unaffected. 
Success The creature takes half damage. 
Failure The creature takes full damage and is [[Sickened]] by the agonizing pain of its burns. 
Critical Failure The creature takes full damage and is cursed. The victim's flesh appears charred and burned, and the pain of being burned alive never fully vanishes. The cursed creature takes a –2 status penalty to all checks from the constant pain. Healing doesn't alter the appearance of the burns or lessen the penalty, but removing the curse does.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Devil's Howl** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (auditory, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, occult) The Sandpoint Devil unleashes a bloodcurdling howl that can be heard for miles. Each creature within a 100-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become [[Frightened]] (frightened 3 and [[Fleeing]] as long as it remains frightened on a critical failure). Creatures that attempt this Will save are then immune to Devil's Howl for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Trample]]** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Medium or smaller, hoof, DC 23</span>

###  Other Devils

For over a decade, the legend of the Sandpoint Devil has persisted in western Varisia. Most hold that it's the fantasy of simple folk and booze-filled bellies, but locals insist it exists. Other creatures akin to the Sandpoint Devil might exist elsewhere in the world, with slight variations on their innate spells and the nature of their Accursed Breath.
