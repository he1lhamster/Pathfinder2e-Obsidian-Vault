# Cavern Troll

Insatiable scavengers stalking the eternal gloom of the Darklands, cavern trolls consume all in their path—even rocks and minerals when more nourishing sustenance is scarce. These rocky goliaths can tunnel through stone with their iron-sharp claws.
 Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating vulnerability to sunlight that petrifies them on sustained contact. Unlike common trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by fire. The crystalline nature of their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.
 As cavern trolls age, their flinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete with large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and weighs about 2,000 pounds.

###  Nar-Voth Delicacies

Both cavern trolls and [[DATABASE/monster/Xorn|xorns]]—squat, tripartite [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Earth|earth elementals]]—share a voracious appetite for deposits of precious minerals. When either group encounters the other, a frenzy of claws and ravenous gorging ensues until only one side remains. Powerful cavern trolls who consume a critical mass of xorns can gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Tremorsense|tremorsense]] and rule as monarchs over their subterranean kin.
