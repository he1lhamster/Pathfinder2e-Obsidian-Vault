###  Shootist Entourages

Many drow shootists have a magnetic bravado that draws others to follow and learn from them. Few shootists are as skilled at teaching as they are at fighting, however, and their followers aren't much more than an entourage. These hangers-on are rarely as lucky or quick as the shootist, so shootists lose their followers to monsters or mischance with startling frequency.
