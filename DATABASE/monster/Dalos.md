# Dalos

Dalos are reclusive fey that dwell within or near remote volcanoes and volcanic vents and resemble the massive calderas they call home. They more often dwell within the superheated confines of these locales than in the “cold wastelands” beyond their warmth and are therefore rarely encountered outside such environments. Like most fey, dalos are capricious and vengeful. They hate being disturbed above all else and will often warn away intruders with only the throw of a red-hot boulder before attacking outright.
 A dalos stands 25 feet tall and weighs in excess of 20,000 pounds.

The DC to end this persistent damage decreases by 5 each turn after the first as the magma cools.</span>

###  Dalos Allies

Because of their reclusiveness, dalos are unlikely to be encountered in the company of other creatures, though on occasion they may serve as begrudging guardians for powerful magma dragons or tribes of fire giants.
