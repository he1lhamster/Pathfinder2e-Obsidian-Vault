Each turn while attached, the pickled punk automatically deals the damage from its jaws Strike to the creature to which it's attached. It also wriggles about, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC as long as it's not also [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]].</span>
