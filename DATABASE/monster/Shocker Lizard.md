# Shocker Lizard

These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning strong enough to harm significantly larger foes. Though they're meek and docile when encountered alone, shocker lizards are significantly more aggressive in packs, when they can amplify each other's electrical attacks.
 Shocker lizards are notoriously difficult to domesticate because they're dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and weighs 25 pounds.

**Greater Electrolocation** A shocker lizard can sense minute electrical charges in living creatures, which it can use as a precise sense at a range of 20 feet. This distance increases to 100 feet against any creature that has used an electricity effect within the last minute.

The shocker lizard can't use Shocking Burst again for 1 minute.
 Up to four shocker lizards can combine their Shocking Bursts. In this case, the lizards can delay the release of their electricity until any other shocker lizard within 30 feet completes its Shocking Burst. The combined Shocking Bursts create an emanation with the combined area from all participating shocker lizards. For each additional shocker lizard that joins the burst, the damage increases by 3d8 and the save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four lizards dealing 12d8 damage with a DC 21 save).</span>

###  Shocker Lizard Traps

[[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Kobold|Kobolds]] are particularly fond of using shocker lizards in their trap designs, although such traps rarely keep the shocker lizards' safety and comfort in mind, forcing these cruel but creative kobolds to constantly replace the permanently restrained lizards they've set up to defend their lairs.
