<span class="in-box-ability">**Shattering Death** (cold) When the blackfrost guecubu is destroyed, it shatters and fills the air around it with a cloud of razor-sharp shards of ice. Creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 8d8 cold damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save). Creatures that critically fail this save also take 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]].</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Break Ground** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (arcane, earth, transmutation) The guecubu stomps, and the ground breaks and ripples in a 30-foot emanation, erupting in razor-sharp, crisscrossing spikes of rock that deal 3d8 piercing damage to creatures in the area (DC 26 basic Reflex save). The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain, with each square dealing 3 piercing damage to a creature that moves through it. A guecubu is immune to these effects. Ground under the effects of a [[DATABASE/ritual/Consecrate|consecrate]] ritual or a [[DATABASE/spell/Circle of Protection|circle of protection]] spell tuned against evil or chaos can't be affected by this ability.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Shove into Ice** (arcane, earth, transmutation) When the blackfrost guecubu successfully [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shoves]] a creature into an ice or frozen earth barrier, the target must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or become merged with the barrier, with the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Meld into Stone|meld into stone]] until the target [[DATABASE/action/Escape|escapes]] (DC 26).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Tundra Glide** The blackfrost guecubu can [[DATABASE/action/Burrow|Burrow]] through any frozen earth, ice, or snow, not including rock.

The creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 2]]. Each time that creature rolls initiative, on their next roll they must roll twice and use the worse result; this is a misfortune effect.</span>
