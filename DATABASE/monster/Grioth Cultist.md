# Grioth Cultist

Grioth cultists represent the lowest tier of their remorseless cult—worshippers of the Elder Mythos tasked with leading scouting missions into new worlds. Though ranked above scouts in the chain of command, they occupy a lowly place in the overall religious hierarchy. Though whispered rumors describe the legendary rituals needed to wrench worlds from their suns, these cultists don't learn this potent magic. Such secrets are left to grioth high priests, who are always the last to arrive in a colonized world.
 Most grioths worship the Outer God [[DATABASE/deity/Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]] in one of his many incarnations, although some worship other entities of the Elder Mythos such as [[DATABASE/deity/Azathoth|Azathoth]], [[DATABASE/deity/Nhimbaloth|Nhimbaloth]], or [[DATABASE/deity/Yog-Sothoth|Yog-Sothoth]]. In the highly rare cases where a grioth is cut off from their society and given the opportunity to explore other religions, they still lean into faiths associated with the stars or the night, such as [[DATABASE/deity/Desna|Desna]] or [[DATABASE/deity/Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthon]]. However, these grioths are loathed by others of their own kind, who view them as dangerous heretics.
