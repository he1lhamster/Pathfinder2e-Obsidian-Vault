# Leucrotta

The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species of hyenas, leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding vocal mimicry to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can first torment and then devour them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds, and they are perpetually filthy. A leucrotta's oversized jaws are lined with rows of jagged, hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through flesh, bone, and even steel with ease.

Fascinated creatures are also **flat-footed**. If the leucrotta attacks, the fascinated condition ends only for the creature that is attacked.

The leucrotta can't duplicate voice-based abilities or spells, though it can perfectly mimic the sound of verbal spellcasting and can attempt to deceive constructs or undead that respond to voice commands. The leucrotta can't imitate speech in languages it doesn't know.</span>

###  Gnoll Masters

Leucrottas often associate with gnolls. They never submit to serve others as beasts of burden, but they sometimes permit gnoll leaders who impress them to ride them into battle as steeds. More often, a leucrotta considers itself to be the true leader of a gnoll clan, whispering and manipulating a gnoll warchief into doing its bidding or (if it tires of the game) goading them into challenging the leucrotta for leadership and then taking over the clan directly after eliminating its rival.
