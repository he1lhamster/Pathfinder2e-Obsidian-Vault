# Raja Rakshasa

When not disguised as a humanoid, the raja rakshasa has the head of an animal. The hands of a raja rakshasa are more subtly unsettling, for the fingers of these fiends bend outward, away from the palms.
 More than any other types of rakshasa, rajas scoff at religion. They understand the power of the divine, yet they view themselves as the only things worthy of worship from mortal creatures; not even their own immortals are deemed deserving of such glorification. Raja rakshasas often form close-knit families that work together to bring down mortal cities or to rule them from the shadows within. Such families of rakshasas often incorporate other breeds of the fiend, often using dandasukas as favored servants or stealthy spies. Even though a raja family works together to achieve a shared goal, infighting and treachery among their own is a constant threat.

It typically loses its fangs Strike unless the humanoid form has fangs or a similar unarmed attack.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Disturbing Vision** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, enchantment, mental, occult) The raja rakshasa’s eyes flash green as it projects a telepathic wave in a 30-foot emanation. All creatures in the area are assailed by a vision of evil decadence from one of the rakshasa’s past lives. Each non-evil creature in the area must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (and [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] on a critical failure). The visions last 1d4 rounds, and while they do, the raja rakshasa and all evil creatures in the area gain a +1 status bonus to all checks. The raja rakshasa can use this ability again only once the previous visions end.</span>

###  Raja Heads

Raja's heads often resemble those of cats or snakes, but they can also be similar to apes, jackals, vultures, elephants, mantises, lizards, rhinos, boars, and more are possible. In most cases, the type of head a raja rakshasa possesses symbolizes its personality—a tiger-headed one is stealthy and ravenous, while a boar-headed one might be gluttonous and crude.
