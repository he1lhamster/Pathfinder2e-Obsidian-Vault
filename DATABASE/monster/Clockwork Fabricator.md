# Clockwork Fabricator

A common sight among Alkenstar work crews, construction teams, and mining operations, the clockwork fabricator is a one-size-fits-all construction companion. These clockworks can be programmed to perform up to two simple, repetitive tasks such as hauling equipment, chopping down trees, or grinding up hunks of ore. The modular nature of these units makes them even more valuable—after finishing a day's work sawing planks, the same machine can be unwound, updated with a new modular arm or two, and then re-wound and given new instructions.
 While it's possible to remove or replace an arm while a fabricator in use, doing so is dangerous and likely to void the manufacturer's warranty, to say nothing of the danger posed to the engineer doing the retrofitting.

###  Anti-Automated Labor Protests

Lately, groups of destitute laborers have been protesting the overuse of clockworks in the day-to-day workforce. They claim workplace injuries are up for those who can get a job, while others have had their positions entirely replaced with automated workers. Though the protests have remained nonviolent, tensions are on the rise, and the shieldmarshals are considering a strong crackdown on protesters.
