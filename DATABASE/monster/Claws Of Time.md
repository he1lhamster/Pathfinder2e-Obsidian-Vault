**Lamp Vision** The Claws of Time is specially attuned to the crystal lamps in the Cradle of Quartz. It can sense creatures within 30 feet of any crystal lamp in the Cradle of Quartz. These lamps are marked as glowing blue dots on the map on page 42. This is a precise sense.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Otherworldly Mind** (mental) Whenever a creature targets the hound with a mental effect, that creature takes 4d6 mental damage (DC 29 basic Will save).

The hound of Tindalos's eyes glow balefully, causing painful but bloodless wounds to rip open in the body of a creature that meets its awful gaze. When a creature ends its turn in the aura's emanation, it takes 6d6 slashing damage (DC 29 basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vulnerable to Curved Space** When a hound of Tindalos is not adjacent to a structural angle of 90º (or more acute), its resistance to physical damage is suppressed and it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. It can't recover from this sickened condition, but the condition ends automatically once the hound is again adjacent to a suitable angle.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Angled Entry** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (structure) The Claws of Time casts a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Dimension Door|dimension door]] spell, but it must transport itself into a space adjacent to an angle of 90º (or more acute) in the structure or environment around it. This means the hound can use _dimension door_ to appear adjacent to any wall or corner in the Cradle of Quartz except for the central geode (area D16).
 Once per day, the hound can use this ability to [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|plane shift]] to or from the [[DATABASE/plane/Dimension of Time|Dimension of Time]], with the same restrictions on what angles next to which it can appear.</span>
