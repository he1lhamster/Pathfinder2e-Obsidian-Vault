# Hesperid

Hesperides are nymphs of sunset, guardians of the colorful golden hues of the setting sun. They live on remote islands, isolated coastal cliffsides, and hidden valleys, all places where the sunset's golden glow can have the strongest effect. Hesperides manipulate sunlight with dancelike motions, allowing them to create graceful ribbons of light at close range and searing rays at a distance. Due to their connection to the beauty of the daily cycle of the setting sun, hesperides feel a satisfaction from methodical routine that can feel alien to wilder, more chaotic fey.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Sunset Dependent** A hesperid is mystically bonded to a single remote location with a good view of the sunset—usually an island, coastal cliff, or valley. If they aren't at that location and able to see the sky at sunset on any given day, they become [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]], increasing the value by 1 for each missed sunset and reducing by 1 only when they see the sunset. A hesperid can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond to a new location.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Create Golden Apple** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (primal, transmutation) While the hesperid is within their bonded location, they can spin golden light around an object they're holding of up to 20 cubic feet in volume and up to 80 Bulk. Doing so condenses the object into a magic apple made of golden light with light Bulk. The golden apple reverts back to its original shape after a full day away from the hesperid's bonded location, or when the hesperid spends a single action (which has the concentrate trait) to end the effect.</span>

###  Dual Guardians

While all nymphs protect areas of natural beauty, hesperides often guard other unusual treasures of a more literal variety, sometimes including items long thought lost. Their steady temperaments and timeless loyalty ensure that they can be trusted to keep whatever they're protecting safe from harm.
