# Wrath Riot

[[DATABASE/monster/Vrock (Wrath Demon)|Wrath demons]] are among the most well-known and feared of the Abyss's fiends, but sometimes a wrath demon becomes stunted in size as the result of too many failed rampages, a punishment inflicted by an angry demonic commander or simple ill fortune. These smaller wrath demons, not much larger than humans, are typically slaughtered quickly by their larger kin, but rarely a group of undersized vrocks can gather in numbers large enough to form a wrath riot.
