# Elephant

Those who live near elephants have learned to be wary of angering the beasts, but even with precautions in place, elephants sometimes still rampage. There is little an individual person can do when even a single elephant becomes enraged. Furthermore, a herd of angry or frightened elephants can easily destroy an entire village.
