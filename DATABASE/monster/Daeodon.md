# Daeodon

Where the typical boar is merely ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the towering daeodon is legitimately hateful and ruthlessly violent. Although omnivorous, the daeodon (known in some regions simply as a giant boar) prefers to feed on flesh. Primarily a scavenger, the daeodon isn’t adverse to attacking creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or to protect any perceived encroachment into its lair or feeding grounds. Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as mounts or war-trained battle beasts; orc cavalry mounted on daeodons is a fearsome force indeed.
 A typical adult daeodon is 10 feet long and 7 feet tall at the shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.
