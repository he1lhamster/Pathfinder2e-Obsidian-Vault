# Giant Amoeba

These blobs of nearly transparent protoplasm are identical in form and behavior to the microscopic creatures from which they have evolved, except their outlandish size makes them all the more dangerous. Unlike slimes, puddings, and other deadly oozes, giant amoebas have an outer membrane that contains their internal structures, making them more susceptible to slashing weapons than their amorphous kin. However, this membrane is also extremely flexible and permeable, allowing them to surround prey and absorb it, suffocating and slowly digesting it in the amoeba's acidic fluids.
