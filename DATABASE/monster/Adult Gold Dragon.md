# Adult Gold Dragon

Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals.

###  Parnoneryx

This adult gold dragon had a long and tragic existence. Formerly an ally of Iomedae, he was defeated by a powerful white dragon and imprisoned in ice. Though freed by the Glorious Reclamation, he was soon slain by evil adventurers who used his head to create a powerful weapon known as a tathlum—which was used to lift the siege of Citadel Rivad and end the Glorious Reclamation.
