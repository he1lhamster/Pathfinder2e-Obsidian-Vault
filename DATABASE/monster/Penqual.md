# Penqual

Although penquals are independent beings, each resembles a tight crowd of featureless humanoids pressed together in a mob. Penquals are most at home in large population centers, where they can don clothing to blend in. When large crowds, such as those found at festivals, are scarce, a penqual hunts at night, where a mass of revelers might draw attention but not suspicion.
