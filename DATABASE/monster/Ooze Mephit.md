# Ooze Mephit

Slick in every sense of the word, ooze mephits are unapologetic sycophants, shamelessly flattering anyone they may be able to con a favor out of, although their lack of intelligence and subtlety means that only the most vain or trusting targets fail to see through their honeyed words. Lacking proper bones, these ocher-colored mephits have bodies consisting primarily of ooze and muck. They smell disgusting, and their touch leaves stains that are almost impossible to get out.
