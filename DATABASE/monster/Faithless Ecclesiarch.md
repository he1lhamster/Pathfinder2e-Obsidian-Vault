# Faithless Ecclesiarch

Faithless ecclesiarchs were powerful religious leaders in life—archpriests, hierarchs, oracles, and divine servitors personally blessed by their deities. They are adept at corrupting the pious and inspiring their fellow herexens, often becoming leaders among their kind. This faithless ecclesiarch once worshipped [[Nethys]], god of magic.
