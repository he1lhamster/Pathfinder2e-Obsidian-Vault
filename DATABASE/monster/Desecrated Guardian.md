# Desecrated Guardian

Countless temples across Golarion, dedicated to deities both living and forgotten, have risen and fallen through the ages. Many find themselves buried under sand, snow, or vine never to be found. In such places, the spirits of the faithful can bind with their ruined temple to form a guardian construct, though with nothing left to guard, these spirits often become hollow, resentful, and filled with malice. These “desecrated guardians” lie in wait, sometimes for centuries, and destroy any adventurers who happen upon them. The most powerful desecrated guardians, such as the one presented here, incorporate the structures of multiple temples into their massive serpentine forms.

###  Desecrated Temples

Many of the temples that dot the peaks of the Wall of Heaven lay abandoned or in complete ruin. The magic in some of these places lives on, corrupted by time, decay, and the nightmarish extraplanar powers of Leng often found at Golarion's highest altitudes. There are dark tales of adventurers seeking refuge within a lone temple along the Wall of Heaven only to meet a terrible death at the hands of the temple's desecrated guardian. Although granting hospitality to strangers is a tenet of many Wall of Heaven temples, stories of monstrosities in disguise give some climbers pause as they approach a potential sanctuary.
