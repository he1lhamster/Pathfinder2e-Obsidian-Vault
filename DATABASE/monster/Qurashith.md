# Qurashith

Qurashith—or “gluttonwings” in the Common tongue—are fearsome, bat-like predators that haunt the upper reaches of Gluttondark’s cavern-worlds. These monstrosities are no mere beasts. A qurashith does not simply devour its victims; once it kills its prey, it physically subsumes the creature into its own body, metabolizing the prey’s spiritual essence. Close inspection of a qurashith reveals that its body is an amalgamation of the fiend and its extraplanar and mortal victims, bound together by webs of demonic scar tissue and sticky acidic pus. While the individual personalities of a qurashith’s victims gradually metabolize and diffuse into its very substance over time, a particularly charismatic or magically powerful victim might exert some influence over the qurashith’s mind for a short time.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Adhesive Body** Any creature that Strikes the qurashith with a melee weapon must attempt a DC 37 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature is disarmed of its weapon, which becomes stuck to the qurashith’s body; if the Strike was an unarmed attack, the creature’s limb sticks to the qurashith’s body and the creature becomes [[Immobilized]]. A creature must succeed at a DC 31 Athletics check to retrieve a stuck weapon. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 acid damage and the weapon remains stuck, and on a critical failure, the creature also becomes stuck to the qurashith and becomes immobilized. A stuck creature takes 2d6 acid damage each round it remains stuck to the qurashith and can use an [[Escape]] action to try to free itself from the monster (DC 31).</span><span class="in-box-ability"> [[Frightful Presence]] (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 90 feet, DC 33</span>

###  Many-Minded Beings

Despite having no organized civilization, qurashith flock and lair together and occasionally even hunt in packs, communicating horrifically through the compelled, agonized voices of the victims grafted onto their bodies.
