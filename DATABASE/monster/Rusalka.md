# Rusalka

These androgynous, river-dwelling fey delight in manipulating the emotions of those unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp, using humiliation to break their victims' wills. Rusalkas enjoy keeping their broken toys nearby, both for continuing entertainment and to aid in the rusalkas' defense, as the shame their captives feel often drives them to become obsessively loyal to these fey.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Beckoning Call** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, concentrate, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal) The rusalka cries out a compelling invitation. Each non-fey creature within a 300-foot emanation must attempt a DC 27 Will save. The effect lasts for 1 round, but if the rusalka uses Beckoning Call again on subsequent rounds, the duration extends by 1 round for all affected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against Beckoning Call, that creature is temporarily immune for 24 hours. 
**Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Failure** The creature is [[Fascinated]] and must spend each of its actions to move closer to the rusalka, avoiding obvious dangers. If a beckoned creature is adjacent to the rusalka, it stays still and doesn't act. If attacked by the rusalka, the creature is freed from captivation at the end of the rusalka's turn. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but if attacked by the rusalka, the creature can attempt a new save only at the start of its next turn, rather than being freed at the end of the rusalka's turn.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Constrict]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> 2d8+10 bludgeoning, DC 32</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Entangling Tresses** A rusalka can have up to eight creatures grabbed within their tresses at a time.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Flowing Hair** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The rusalka attempts an [[Athletics]] check against each grabbed creature's Fortitude DC.

###  Blue Week

Those living in areas where rusalkas dwell know well to avoid the water during the week-long period in early Sarenith when the fey become particularly active, a time known in many regions as Blue Week. Most villages prohibit swimming and fishing during this time, though the prohibition is difficult to enforce, as it takes place during the height of good weather. Particularly superstitious folk take care to lock their doors both from within and without.
