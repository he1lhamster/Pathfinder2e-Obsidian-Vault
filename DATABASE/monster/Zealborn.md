# Zealborn

Zealborn arise from mortals who become consumed by a noble or idealistic vision and choose undeath as a means of pursuing that vision. Unlike [[Lich]], who use undeath as a path toward immortality and individual power, zealborn undergo their transformation with the total conviction that their cause is so just it should never die. They manipulate and control dozens of fanatical followers who sacrifice themselves—and rise again as powerful zeal-damned ghouls—for the zealborn's cause.
**Recall Knowledge - Undead ([[Religion]])**: DC 32

**Specific Lore**: DC 27

<span class="in-box-ability">**Rejuvenation** (necromancy, occult) When a zealborn is destroyed, it re-forms, fully healed, near a follower of its choice in 1d10 days. For the purposes of rejuvenation, a follower is defined as an intelligent creature who's well acquainted with the zealborn and is a true believer in the zealborn's mission, not merely a lukewarm supporter. A zealborn can be permanently destroyed only if they have no current followers or can be convinced to end their own life.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Zealous Restoration** A zealborn can't regain Hit Points through resting or negative healing; they feed only on the idealism of their supporters, regaining 10 Hit Points per day for each creature under the effects of a [[Geas]] cast by the zealborn. Creatures under a zealborn's _geas_ have their maximum HP reduced by 10 each day until they are burned away to a husk and perish. After 24 hours, such creatures rise as zeal-damned [[Ghoul]] under the zealborn's control. Zeal-damned ghouls eat only the flesh of evil or chaotic creatures and deal an additional 1d6 chaotic and 1d6 negative damage with their attacks.</span>

###  Redemption

Zealborns begin with a great desire to do good but can become twisted mockeries of their ideals. When confronted with the horrors wrought by their crusades, some can be shocked out of their obsession; they can release themselves from undeath if they truly realize how far they've strayed from their original cause.
