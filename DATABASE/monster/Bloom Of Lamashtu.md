# Bloom Of Lamashtu

A thick, green stalk with spiraling rows of thorns stands at the center of this enormous flowering plant. Each flower has a growing seed pod at its center, surrounded by vibrant petals in a wide variety of colors. Crafted after consecutive seasons of experimentation, prayer, and ritual, the bloom of [[DATABASE/deity/Lamashtu|Lamashtu]] is the triumph of the cultist Darivan and his Cult of the Bloom. The fiendish plant aids their effort to infect the humanoid population of the Stolen Lands and replace them with monstrous predators. While the Bloom of Lamashtu is intelligent and is capable of understanding [[DATABASE/language/Abyssal|Abyssal]], it has very little interest in anything other than spreading its curse.
 Cultivated to spread misery and violence, the bloom is quietly malevolent, growing its seeds as rapidly as it can. It is 12 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Defensive Burst <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** The bloom takes slashing damage. **Effect** The bloom of Lamashtu sprays a gout of acid against an adjacent creature, inflicting 9d6 acid damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save).

Unlike the bloom curse contracted from secondary sources (as detailed in Chapter 5), there is no onset time for this version of the curse, and the creature spawned by the victim's death may be much more powerful and is always chaotic evil.
 **Saving Throw** DC 29 Fortitude; **Stage 1** no ill effects (1 day); **Stage 2** [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] (1 day); **Stage 3** enfeebled 1 and 2d6 poison damage (8 hours); **Stage 4** unconscious and 4d6 poison damage (10 minutes); **Stage 5** death; **Special** A creature that dies from the bloom curse explodes in a blast of [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]] foliage and releases a monster into the world. This creature is a chaotic evil low-intelligence beast or dragon (chosen by the GM ) of the same level as the dead creature.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spew Seed Pod** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (conjuration, poison, primal) The bloom of Lamashtu's central stalk disgorges a pulsing seed pod from its flower, spitting it at a range of up to 60 feet and creating a 20-foot burst when the seed pod explodes into a spray of supernatural acidic poison. All creatures in this area must attempt a DC 29 Reflex save. The bloom of Lamashtu can't Spew Seed Pod for 1d4 rounds. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature takes 3d6 acid damage and 3d6 poison damage. 
**Failure** The creature takes 5d6 acid damage and 5d6 poison damage and is exposed to the bloom curse. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but 10d6 acid damage and 10d6 poison damage, plus knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] by the force of the blast.</span>

###  Fiendish Genesis

**Warning - this sidebar contains spoilers for the Kingmaker adventure path.**
During this campaign, there is but one bloom of Lamashtu, as the cult's attempts to cultivate more of them have so far been failures. At your option, more of these fiendish plants could well sprout from the bodies of their victims in time, or they might even already exist in some overgrown corner of the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]]. In this case, the bloom of Lamashtu becomes Rare rather than Unique.
