# Gallowdead

The first gallowdead were hung from enormous, hooked chains from atop the Whispering Tyrant's prison, Gallowspire, and magically bonded to their chains after death. After Gallowspire's destruction, the gallowdead who remained were left to wander the ruins.

Most often, a gallowdead chooses to pull a creature close enough that it's in their reach and out of defensive position, but so the creature still can't reach the gallowdead's body.

###  The Hooked

All gallowdead have massive hooks through their chests. For the oldest gallowdead, their hook signifies that they hung from the fabled Gallowspire. These gallowdead are even more powerful, bleeding raw necromantic power into the air around them. How Tar-Baphon creates new gallowdead with hooks of similar power, after the destruction of Gallowspire, is a topic of great interest to those who oppose the Whispering Tyrant.
