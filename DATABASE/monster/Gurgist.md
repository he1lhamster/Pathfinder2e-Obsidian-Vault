# Gurgist

[[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|Humans]] that become mortics are known as gurgists. They retain their personalities and intelligence, but their bodies rot with every beat of their heart. Gurgists ceaselessly crave raw meat; consuming large quantities can slow, or even reverse, their body's putrefaction for a short time. A gurgist that refuses to consume raw meat rots to death.
 Unlike other mortics, gurgists are capable of sating their hunger without resorting to depravity, making them more likely to be nonevil compared to other mortics. Most gurgists hunt and raise livestock for food—including animals many consider too dangerous to tame. To battle their constant hunger, many take up a single craft, hobby, or performing art to obsess over until the drive to create overcomes the urge to consume. Many study magic or medicine, researching methods to reverse their condition or suspend their putrescence. Others cling to religion, uttering prayers despite the pain and begging the gods to cleanse them of evil.
 Nearly all gurgists are disgusted by their clumsy, rotting bodies. They shroud themselves in fine clothes and cover their faces with elaborate masks. Most consider their mask their true face.

**Nourishing Feast** The gurgist spends 1 hour consuming 1 Bulk of raw meat to reverse their body's putrescence. For 1 hour, the gurgist appears to be a pale, bloated human. They have an automatic result of 32 on [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks and DCs to pass as a non-mortic [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|human]]. While under the effects of Nourishing Feast, Rotting Flesh ceases to function.
