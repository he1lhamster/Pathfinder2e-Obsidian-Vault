# Sea Drake

Long and slender, sea drakes have fins down the length of their backs and webbing between their talons, making them just as adapted for gliding through ocean waves as the skies above. More solitary than most drakes, they hunt and live alone. Although most sea drakes make their roosts high on ocean-facing cliffs, it isn't unheard of for them to dwell in underwater caves, living entirely aquatic lives.
**Recall Knowledge - Dragon ([[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]])**: DC 22

The lightning then arcs to up to three secondary targets within 30 feet of the primary target, striking the closest available targets first.
