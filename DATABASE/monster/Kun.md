# Kun

Hungry and resentful, the malevolent kun is a mythological fish monster that dwells in the remotest, coldest depths of the ocean. This massively powerful creatures could easily rule a subaquatic domain if they cared to, but kuns are also famous for their total self-absorption and complete ambivalence toward other forms of life. A kun remains as far away from other creatures as they can, subsisting on only their own icy hatred. They can consume and digest prey, but such feedings are incidental. Most kuns remain ignorant and uncaring, keeping themselves in the dark, disregarding any signs of life around them except to occasionally lash out with a spiteful attack.

###  Change of Heart

The kun hunts at the bottom of the cold, dark sea. But if shone the light of the sun, a kun begins to understand that it dwells within a different, bigger world. When flocks of birds or schools of fish cast their dappled shadows upon a kun, they might grow weary of their solitude or become curious about the realm above. In extremely rare circumstances and for their own mysterious reasons, a kun might sacrifice some of their power to undergo a permanent, one-time transformation. In a final dramatic act, the kun flings themself up and out of the ocean, allowing the sun to fully wash over them. In the process, the kun transforms from the hateful fish into a noble and curious bird called a [[DATABASE/monster/Peng|peng]].
