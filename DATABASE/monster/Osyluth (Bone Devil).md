description: "Skittering scavenger vermin common throughout the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]]\
  \ , ostovites roam battlefields to harvest flesh and bones. After the ostovites\
  \ dissolve and slurp up the flesh for sustenance, they craft the bones into elaborate\
  \ shells they refer to as \u201Cbone chariots.\u201D<br/><br/> These bone chariots\
  \ move under the ostovites' command and serve as an important marker of rank in\
  \ ostovite nests. To the tiny ostovites, bigger is better, and building large skeletal\
  \ conveyances is the only way for them to increase their standing in life. Although\
  \ they feel deeply inferior to creatures larger than themselves, this fear can be\
  \ overwhelmed by the ostovites' visceral desire to harvest those creatures' bones\
  \ to increase their own status. When confronted with a particularly massive skeleton,\
  \ ostovites generally fight among themselves and end up splitting the haul. However,\
  \ there are rare instances of the selfish creatures working together to puppeteer\
  \ a much larger bone chariot.<br/><br/> Ostovites' faint understanding of anatomy\
  \ results in bone chariots that look more like a nightmarish attempt at art than\
  \ any creature the bones were pulled from. Some powerful fiends and their admirers\
  \ collect this strange art by bribing ostovites with skeletons or finding ways to\
  \ kill ostovites without disrupting the chariot around them. Despite ostovites'\
  \ origins in the Abyss, they are neither [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demons]]\
  \ nor [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Qlippoth|qlippoth]] .<br/><br/> Without the protection\
  \ of the major fiends, they find their homes in nooks and crannies along the corners\
  \ of their home plane. Though they have no innate ability to cross the planar boundaries,\
  \ flaws in the Abyss's fabric often lead them to worlds across the planes. Ostovites\
  \ that have thus migrated are often much happier. Away from demonic abuse, they\
  \ usually can be found near mortal crypts and battlefields. On the [[DATABASE/plane/Material\
  \ Plane|Material Plane]] , they rarely have to face any threats other than the [[DATABASE/trait/Undead|undead]]\
  \ , clerics of [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]] , and families of the deceased.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall\

# Osyluth (Bone Devil)

An osyluth is an unparalleled inquisitor that revels in the sadism and torture for which [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell]] is so well known. These devils' charge is to seek out heresies, both among mortals and among other fiends—a commandment they uphold with unwavering fervor. They spawn within the Styx-fed swamps of Hell's fifth layer, Stygia; where heresies and the souls of heretics stagnate, osyluths eventually rise. In the remote corners of that same layer of Hell, they build massive, calcified hives where they perform their vile interrogations and perfect their torturous arts upon lesser devils and petitioners alike.

###  Artists of Agony

An osyluth practices the craft of torture with the passion of an artist. Their skill draws forth all manner of truths and secrets from their victims, which an osyluth can recall with immaculate precision even centuries later. Over time, osyluths amass sizable collections of information, making them particularly valuable resources to diabolists and other evil spellcasters who crave infernal knowledge. Of course, such conjurers also often employ osyluths for the devils’ cruel talents of interrogation, perpetuating the cycle of spilled blood and stolen secrets.
