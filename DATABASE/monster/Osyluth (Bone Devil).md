# Osyluth (Bone Devil)

An osyluth is an unparalleled inquisitor that revels in the sadism and torture for which [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell]] is so well known. These devils' charge is to seek out heresies, both among mortals and among other fiends—a commandment they uphold with unwavering fervor. They spawn within the Styx-fed swamps of Hell's fifth layer, Stygia; where heresies and the souls of heretics stagnate, osyluths eventually rise. In the remote corners of that same layer of Hell, they build massive, calcified hives where they perform their vile interrogations and perfect their torturous arts upon lesser devils and petitioners alike.

###  Artists of Agony

An osyluth practices the craft of torture with the passion of an artist. Their skill draws forth all manner of truths and secrets from their victims, which an osyluth can recall with immaculate precision even centuries later. Over time, osyluths amass sizable collections of information, making them particularly valuable resources to diabolists and other evil spellcasters who crave infernal knowledge. Of course, such conjurers also often employ osyluths for the devils’ cruel talents of interrogation, perpetuating the cycle of spilled blood and stolen secrets.
