# Alapolo

Short-lived, strange creatures called alapolos cling to the shadows in eerie moonlight, inviting others to dance. Although these “shadow dancers” aren't actively malevolent, they become petulant when others won't dance with them.

<span class="in-box-ability">**One with Shadows** The alapolo isn't affected by darkness, light, or shadow effects that target it unless it chooses to be.

The creature must attempt a DC 38 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and temporarily immune to all Enticing Invitations for 24 hours.
 **Success** The target must spend 1 action on its next turn dancing in place.
 **Failure** The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]]. It is also [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] by the alapolo for 1 minute and can't attack the alapolo as long as it's fascinated. While fascinated, the target must spend 2 actions on each of its turns dancing in place.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is drained 3 and must spend 3 actions on each of its turns dancing in place.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Shifting Shadows** An alapolo's movement doesn't trigger reactions.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Weighty Shadow** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (primal, transmutation) **Requirements** The alapolo is adjacent to a target creature, or the GM determines the alapolo is adjacent to that creature's shadow; **Effect** The alapolo petulantly stomps on a target's shadow, making it incredibly heavy to drag around. The creature takes a –20-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute. As normal, this penalty can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet. Any creatures fascinated by the alapolo due to its Enticing Invitation are freed from their fascination when the alapolo uses this ability, jarred by the graceless stomping.</span>

###  Shadow Dancers

Even fey avoid alapolos, for their dancing is both captivating and exhausting. When a potential dance partner resists their swaying invitations to dance, an alapolo becomes sulky and usually stomps upon the refuser's shadow, giving it a supernatural weight. Avoiding both the dance and the stomp requires incredible diplomacy.
