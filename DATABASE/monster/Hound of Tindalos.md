# Hound of Tindalos

Lean and athirst, the hounds of Tindalos are drawn to those who tamper with the flow of time, travel through time, or use magic or rare alchemical drugs to send their thoughts or perception back or forward in time. Powerful spellcasters can draw them from the [[DATABASE/plane/Dimension of Time|Dimension of Time]] via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the hounds' ire, so few who traffic in such rituals live long enough to spread their knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely interact with other creatures—other than to hunt and destroy those who have attracted their unblinking attention.
 Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Angled Entry** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The hound of Tindalos casts a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Dimension Door|dimension door]] spell, but it must transport itself into a space adjacent to an angle of 90º (or more acute) in the structure or environment around it. For example, it could teleport to a space adjacent to a wall (using the angle between the wall and floor) or a corner in a room, or adjacent to a sizable tree growing straight up out of the ground, but not to a flat plain or a room with only curved corners and edges.
 Once per day, the hound can use this ability to plane shift to or from the [[DATABASE/plane/Dimension of Time|Dimension of Time]], with the same restrictions on what angles it can appear next to.</span>

###  Tindalos

Ancient texts refer to these relentless temporal hunters as the hounds of Tindalos, yet they never seem to explore what Tindalos actually is. In some references, the implication is that Tindalos is one of the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods, but if this is the case, it is among the most obscure of these entities. Other tomes refer as Tindalos as a location, perhaps even a city or nation that once existed before time began and that can be reached only by methods impossible for any creature bound by the laws of time. In all likelihood, both and neither are right—what Tindalos is may simply be impossible for mortal minds to comprehend.
