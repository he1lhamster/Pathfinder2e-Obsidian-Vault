# Ocluai

Ocluais embody the fear of being lost and helpless in the darkness as well as the danger of unreasoning terror. An ocluai's gray body resembles that of a featherless owl with a serrated beak, the legs of a monkey, and oversized eye sockets full of shadow. The field of unnatural darkness that surrounds an ocluai disorients most creatures; while other gorgas are quick to move in for the kill, ocluais love to perch on a low branch or lintel and watch with their blank expressions as prey succumbs to panic. Though capable fighters, ocluais prefer to hang back and slash at those whose frantic fight brings them within range, letting their prey's own terror drive them over cliffs or bring them to their knees.
 Ocluais understand several languages but rarely communicate with non-fey. When they do, their communication takes the form of unsettling telepathic images projected directly into the other party's mind as the ocluai holds their gaze.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Lost in the Dark** (aura, darkness, enchantment, mental) 60 feet. An ocluai's presence distorts nearby creatures' senses of direction. Nonmagical bright light within the aura becomes dim light, and nonmagical dim light with the aura becomes darkness. Any non-gorga within range of the ocluai's aura that attempts to move must declare where they intend to move. Before moving, however, the creature must attempt a secret DC 20 Will saving throw. An ocluai can exempt specific creatures from this effect. Magical light anywhere within the ocluai's aura increases the light level as normal and reduces the Will save DC by 5.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Success** The creature moves normally.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Failure** The creature moves the intended distance, but not in the right direction. The ocluai chooses the creature's destination and route, which could be a straight line or could include multiple changes in direction. If the path is blocked or would go through obviously dangerous terrain (such as off a cliff or through a fire), the movement ends before the blockage or danger.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> **Critical Failure** As failure, but if the creature's path would lead them into obviously dangerous terrain, they must succeed at a second Will save to end their movement just before they would enter the danger.</span>
