# Red Commander Ant

Second only to the hive's queen, red commanders hold absolute authority over the hive's other ants. Although no red commander can give orders to another, they nevertheless work in an eerie coordination to fulfill their missions as effectively as possible. They have a sense of adaptability and self-preservation that might lead them to abandon a dangerous task, even if doing so costs the lives of lower-ranking ants. Red commanders tend to show glimmers of individuality that other red ants don't, such as by marking their chitinous exoskeletons with commemorations of past battles and martial victories.

These effects last for 1 minute, or until the red commander ant uses The Queen's Enemy on a different creature.</span>
