# Spiny Eurypterid

Spiny eurypterids are aggressive, tenacious, and utterly unwilling to stop chasing prey, even to their own detriment. These creatures are covered with countless needle-like spikes and can grow to rival the size of ocean mammals like orcas. Sailors often find them clinging to the hulls of ships, as spiny eurypterids mistake them for prey and are too stubborn to let go.
