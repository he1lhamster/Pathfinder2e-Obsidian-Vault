# Seaweed Leshy

Calmer than most of their other botanical brethren, seaweed leshys are a tranquil, discerning breed of leshy. They seek to mimic the ocean in their attitudes, moving with the waves of life and accepting what comes and goes while acknowledging the good and the bad.
 Seaweed leshys make their homes in tidal pools surrounded by other sea creatures. They believe their freshwater counterparts to be sheltered and naive, living in their secluded ponds and babbling brooks, though this doesn't stop them from forming friendships with freshwater leshys.
 Seaweed leshys vary in size, shape, and physical makeup. While the majority of seaweed leshys reach about 2 feet in height, some remain as small bundles of strands that stand about 6 to 8 inches tall.

###  Undersea Treasure

Seaweed leshys are skilled treasure hunters. They often dive deep into the oceans to salvage any coin or other treasures they can find from shipwrecks. These leshys also sometimes bury caches of their loot once they rescue it from its former location.
