# Cavalry Brigade

A cavalry brigade consists of several Hellknights and a single field-maralictor, in the distinctive armor of their order and bearing lances; the maralictor speaks for the brigade, questioning travelers the brigade encounters and barking orders. A Hellknight brigade is typically based at a keep or other fortification controlling an area measured by a day's ride in every direction—about 25 miles. Farther-ranging missions are possible but require substantial logistical support.

###  Troop Gear

Since the component members of a troop are individually much less powerful than the troop as a whole, a troop's gear is typically of negligible utility or value. This troop's [[Hellknight Plate]] is an exception, and a party might be able to salvage a suit or two from their defeated foes—if they're willing to risk the wrath of the Order of the Nail!
