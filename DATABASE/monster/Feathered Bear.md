# Feathered Bear

Born from spirits possessing the qualities of strength, endurance, and ferocity, these spirit guides act as martial guardians for mortals under their care. Most have a burning hatred for [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demons]], [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|devils]], and other fiends who prey on mortal weaknesses. However, they also display care and consideration around mortal children, who in turn seem to instinctively recognize the beings as protectors. Strength takes many forms, some evident in their power—like the feathered bear—and some unassuming.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Bond with Mortal** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (mental, necromancy, primal) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The spirit guide forms a bond with a mortal creature. While the bond exists, the spirit guide increases their current and maximum Hit Points by 20, gains a +2 status bonus to their attack and damage rolls, and can communicate telepathically with the bonded mortal as long as the two beings are on the same plane. The spirit guide can only be bonded with one mortal at a time, and they can take this action again to end the bond or to form a new bond (which also ends the old bond). The bond also ends if the spirit guide or the mortal dies.
 This bond strengthens the spirit guide's connection to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]. While bonded, the spirit guide loses the incorporeal and spirit traits, loses their immunities and resistances, and changes their Strikes to deal the appropriate physical damage (typically piercing or slashing) instead of force damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Bonded Strike** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirements** The spirit guide is currently Bonded with a Mortal; **Effect** The spirit guide makes a jaws Strike. If this attack hits, the bonded mortal can spend their reaction to Strike the same target.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Feathered Charge** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The feathered bear Strides and makes a Strike at the end of that movement. During the Stride, the feathered bear ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain, and they can move across air as easily as solid ground. If the feathered bear doesn't end their movement on solid ground, they fall as soon as the Strike is completed.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Mauler** The feathered bear gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage rolls against creatures they have [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]].</span>
