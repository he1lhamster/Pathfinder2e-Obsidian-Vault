# Ainamuuren, Corrupted Victim Of Osoyo

Osoyo is alien to Golarion, and while it was first encountered by the [[Elf]] of Sovyrian, the Blackfrost Whale was alien there as well. At that time, in the earliest years of what is known on Golarion as the Age of Legends, Osoyo held only a small fraction of the potential power it represents today, and yet was still dangerous enough that Sovyrian's High Families wanted it far from their home. They lured the entity from Sovyrian, perhaps intending to escort it out into deep space, but their magic began to falter and they were forced to choose Golarion as the site of its prison. They chose the north pole, figuring that as life spread on their sister planet, this remote location would ensure Osoyo's prison would never be discovered.
 But the Castrovelian elves underestimated the people known as saumen kar. When they discovered the Blackfrost Whale, the saumen kar took it upon themselves to build a vast city and temple above Osoyo's prison to ensure it remained locked away. Earthfall disrupted these goals, and now, thousands of years later, only one saumen kar remains alive, remembering the ancient ways of his nearly extinct people—Ainamuuren. Then, during the Missing Moment, Ainamuuren was captured by agents of the Blackfrost Whale. He now languishes near Osoyo's prison, slowly being corrupted into something alien. Once he completes this corruption, Osoyo will be fully free from its prison.
 Ainamuuren currently lies in state, not quite dead, but much changed. Blood and blackfrost mat his fur, and writhing tentacles of oily black flesh have grown from his belly, sides, and throat. Pustules on his face bloat and burst, revealing pale, glaring eyes. If this corruption is allowed to run its full course, Ainamuuren's body will transform completely and then burst, turning inside out and serving as a point of entry back into the world for the Blackfrost Whale.
 A detailed exploration of Ainamuuren, including more details about his peoples' history and [[Ainamuuren]], appear on pages 6–11 of _Pathfinder Lost Omens Monsters of Myth_. You can consult these pages for more background about the last saumen kar, but within the context of this Adventure Path, his current status as a corrupted victim of the Blackfrost Whale is the version of him the gatewalkers will encounter.

## Campaign Role

The corrupted Ainamuuren isn't as powerful as his natural form, yet he remains a challenge for the characters. He's the final threat they face in the Gatewalkers Adventure Path. If victorious, they'll be able to restore him to his original body as presented in _Monsters of Myth_. The corrupted incarnation of Ainamuuren has little role beyond the final battle against the characters deep below the First and Last Temple of Aqakaru.

While discorporated, the first time each round that Ainamuuren enters another creature's space or a creature enters Ainamuuren's space, that creature takes 4d8 cold damage and is exposed to [[Blackfrost]].

The targeted creature must attempt a DC 32 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature endures a brief moment where they believe they are imprisoned in the ice, as Osoyo has been for thousands of years, and is [[Slowed]] for 1 round.
 **Failure** The vision of being imprisoned in ice is more profound, and in the span of a few seconds, the creature endures what seems like a thousand years of imprisonment. The creature is [[Paralyzed]] until the end of its next turn, after which it emerges from its paralysis [[Stupefied]].
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature doesn't automatically recover from paralysis at the end of its turn. Instead, it can attempt a new DC 32 save. On a success, the paralysis ends and they are stupefied 1, but on a failure, the paralysis continues for another round.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Invasive Blackfrost** Gatewalker characters are not immune to blackfrost effects inflicted by Ainamuuren, and it's a DC 32 save to resist this affliction. See [[Blackfrost]] for details on this affliction.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Twist Deviance** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (enchantment, mental, occult) Ainamuuren reaches out, then clutches his fingers into a fist and twists his arm, as if he were wrenching and tugging. At the same moment, all gatewalkers in a 60-foot cone that Ainamuuren can see feel the signs they've worn on their bodies since they emerged from their Missing Moment spike with pain, as if Ainamuuren had grabbed that flesh and was twisting and tearing it. The targets must attempt a DC 32 Will save. Ainamuuren can't use Twist Deviance again for 1d4 rounds.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature endures a brief moment of horrific pain and takes 4d8 mental damage.
 **Failure** The pain is much greater, and for a moment the creature is convinced that the portion of their flesh that was adorned with the sign of the gatewalker has been torn free. They take 8d8 mental damage and can't use their deviant abilities for 1 round.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but 16d8 mental damage and they can't use their deviant abilities for 1 minute.</span>
