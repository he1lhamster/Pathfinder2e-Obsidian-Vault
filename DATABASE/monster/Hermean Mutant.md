The mutant attempts an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] all creatures within 10 feet. The mutant's multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until it has made all the Athletics checks that are part of its Grasping Hands. Creatures that are [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] are pulled to a space adjacent to the mutant. This is forced movement.</span>
