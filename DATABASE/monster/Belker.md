# Belker

These reclusive elementals have glowing red eyes, leathery wings, and long, sharp claws. While they always retain their shape, belkers can control the solidity of their forms at will, transforming into clouds of smoke, ash, and dust.

###  Belker Lore

Fiercely territorial, belkers attack trespassers into their lands without mercy, slithering inside their lungs and raking their bodies from the inside. Many belkers are loyal to the Elemental Lord of Air, [[DATABASE/deity/Ra|Hshura]], but some hold secret allegiances to [[DATABASE/deity/Ymeri|Ymeri]], who holds domain over fire and smoke.
