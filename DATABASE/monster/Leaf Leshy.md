<span class="in-box-ability">**Verdant Burst** (healing) When a leaf leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from its body, restoring 1d4 Hit Points to each plant creature in a 30-foot emanation. This area is filled with tree saplings, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment for these trees, they wither after 24 hours.</span>

As long as the leshy spends at least 1 action gliding each round, it remains in the air at the end of each turn. For the purpose of determining damage from falls, a leaf leshy always treats falls as if they were 20 feet shorter.</span>
