# Tzitzimitl

Due to their affinity for darkness and apocalyptic terror, tzitzimitls are widely feared as harbingers of death and destruction. A solar eclipse marks their arrivals, and they draw strange powers of darkness and electricity from these phenomena. Some sages believe tzitzimitls to be instruments of the gods, called down to destroy worlds whose times have come, while others claim they're the undead remains of stranded exiles from a far-off civilization of spacefaring giants. The legends that include them are ancient and fragmented, but some tell of tzitzimitls being defeated by great heroes and sealed away—though these tales imply that the enormous undead now lie buried and waiting, soon to rampage again should their tombs be breached.

###  Harbingers of the End

A tzitzimitl's arrival in a region often precedes a deadly disaster or apocalyptic event. It isn't known whether the tzitzimitl accompanies an event already fated to occur or if the undead causes such events through their own strange magic.
