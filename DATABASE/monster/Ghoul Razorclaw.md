###  Fists Full of Gold

While little is known about origin of the order of ghoul assassins who dip their claws into molten [[Adamantine]], survivors of razorclaw assassination attempts often find themselves with a lucrative opportunity should they be able to extract the precious metal from the claws of their would-be killers. A player character who uses an adamantine weapon or cutting tool to remove the adamantine and succeeds at a DC 35 [[Crafting]] check for each claw (up to 10) can remove 50 gp of adamantine, which can then be sold or [[Craft]] into adamantine weapons or armor.
