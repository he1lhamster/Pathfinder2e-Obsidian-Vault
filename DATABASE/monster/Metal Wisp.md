# Metal Wisp

A metal wisp is a roiling sphere of rust particles and sharp metal fragments, all furiously orbiting a liquid metal core that resembles the skull of a mortal creature—usually a humanoid, but animal and even more fantastical skulls are not uncommon. They don't form attachments as easily as wisps from other elemental planes, which tend to view metal wisps as too morose, although they retain a certain curiosity since their return from the planar severance.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Resonance** (aura, metal) 30 feet. All wisps vibrate at a frequency attuned to their element, resonating with and empowering all creatures and effects sharing that trait.

Allies within 30 feet that have benefited from the wisp's resonance in the last hour gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the wisp's current Hit Points. These temporary Hit Points last 1 hour.</span><span class="in-box-ability"> A wisp that uses this reaction is permanently destroyed, and it can be restored only by a _wish_ ritual or similarly powerful effect. If an ability would prevent the wisp's destruction (for instance, if the wisp is summoned and would merely be dismissed), Accord Essence has no effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Rust Cloud** A metal wisp is constantly surrounded by a cloud of rust flakes that cause it to be [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] from creatures more than 5 feet away from it.</span>
