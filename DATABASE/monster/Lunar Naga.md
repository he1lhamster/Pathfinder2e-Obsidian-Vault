# Lunar Naga

Lunar nagas are skilled diviners and astrologers whose dark scales and white hair sparkle with motes of light that mimic the night skies to which they are forever drawn. While they are less physically imposing than other nagas, they possess a graceful beauty that many find entrancing, even without the help of the naga's inherent magical abilities. Earning a lunar naga's trust is difficult, but not impossible, especially for someone who shares the creature's interest in the celestial sphere.
 As they have no hands, lunar nagas use [[DATABASE/spell/Mage Hand|mage hand]] to manipulate delicate instruments and fine telescopes to observe the night sky. They track the positions of celestial bodies, recording their discoveries in esoteric journals. At their best, lunar nagas are wise and mysterious beings who seek to expand their knowledge of the cosmos. At their worst, after too much exposure to the unfathomable entities that dwell in the darkness between the stars, they become dark prophets who drive others to commit terrible deeds in the name of abominable masters.
 On Golarion, the lunar nagas of the nation of Nagajor use their abilities to serve many communities as soothsayers. A few have founded observatories in which they and their followers explore the night sky. Some nagas even use their knowledge of the stars as navigators on ships or overland caravans. In the broader world, where people do not give nagas deference as nearly divine rulers, lunar nagas try to avoid contact with outsiders or use their magical powers of disguise to hide their true forms from all but their most worthy allies.

All creatures within a 30.foot emanation must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] until the end of the naga's next turn (on a critical failure, fascinated creatures drop whatever items they are carrying as well). The lunar naga can Sustain a Spell on Hypnosis. If the naga moves, affected creatures are compelled to remain within 30 feet of the naga and must spend each of its actions moving closer to the naga as expediently as possible on its next turn. If a creature is unable to end its turn within 30 feet of the naga, the effect ends for that creature.

###  Lunar Naga Addiction

Some people enjoy the effects of lunar naga venom and have developed ways to enhance the euphoric qualities through alchemical refinement. While some merchants pay nagas for their venom, most hire hunters to capture and enslave the creatures. As a result, nagas despise any humanoid who sells or buys their venom for any reason. Refined lunar naga venom is identical in price and effect to [[DATABASE/equipment/Dreamtime Tea|dreamtime tea]].
