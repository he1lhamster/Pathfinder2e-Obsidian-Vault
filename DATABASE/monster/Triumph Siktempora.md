# Triumph Siktempora

Triumph siktemporas embody the emotional satisfaction of overcoming a task that took up much of a creature's mind, be it taking an apple seed from between one's teeth or winning a war. They exult in every victory they attain; however, they value only those successes won fairly not only abiding by the established rules of a competition but also enforcing those rules mercilessly upon other competitors.
 These siktemporas appear as small humanoids with four muscular arms and digitigrade legs. They take great joy in draping themselves in golden clothes and medals that commemorate the countless victories which spawned them, and their faces bear proud, dazzling smiles and expressions of success—but these features never move.
**Unspecific Lore**: DC 35

###  Triumphant Appearances

Triumph siktemporas find purpose and a sense of self in winning and victory, so when a war rages across the land and one side struggles behind the rest, a triumph siktempora might venture to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] to join the side of the underdog and grasp victory—or die trying! The same can happen for a major sporting event or even an intense legal battle where a persuasive voice could turn the tide. All that matters to them is victory
