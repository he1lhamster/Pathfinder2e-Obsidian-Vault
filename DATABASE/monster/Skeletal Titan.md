<span class="in-box-ability">**Bone Debris** The bones a skeletal titan throws are large enough to clutter the battlefield. When the skeletal titan hits a creature with a bone attack, the projectile becomes difficult terrain in the square the creature occupies (or, if the creature occupies more than one square, one square it occupies of the titan's choice).
