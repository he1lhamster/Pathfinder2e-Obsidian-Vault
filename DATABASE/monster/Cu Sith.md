# Cu Sith

Cu siths are hound-like doorkeepers of remote portals to other planes, particularly portals to the untamed realm of the fey, the First World. They are highly territorial and roam the highland moors they call home, constantly on the hunt for any creatures that might intrude on their territory. Those that bargain for safe passage to or from a portal find cu siths to be vigilant escorts that keep travelers safe from extraplanar threats but also ensure their charges don’t veer from the most direct path to their destination. Cu siths are highly proficient hunters, and to mortals they offer a single warning in the form of their terrifying bark. Creatures that refuse to flee upon hearing a cu sith’s warning bark risk a quick and brutal death.
 Cu siths cut imposing figures; they are as large as bulls and covered in intertwining roots, plant matter, and shaggy green and white fur that terminates in a long, plaited tail. Their eyes glow with a fiery green light.

###  Cu Siths on Golarion

Cu siths can be found wherever the barrier between the Material Plane and the First World is weak, particularly in the marshy highlands of Ustalav, where stories of the fey stretch back as far as memory. Superstitious townsfolk believe cu siths drag their prey back to the First World, where their victims’ immortal souls fuse with the vital energy of that wild plane.
