# Brimorak (Arson Demon)

These goat-headed demons have glowing red eyes and flaming hooves but measure only about 3 feet in height. Born from the souls of arsonists, the fiery brimoraks continue the work they pursued in life, as everything they touch quickly burns.
 As a general rule, brimoraks are ill-tempered even for demons, although their spite turns to glee in the face of a growing fire. Those who have survived encounters with these fiends report that they remember the braying sound of the brimoraks' laughter as clearly as the heat of the flames or the choking scent of smoke.

**Smoke Vision** Smoke doesn't impair a brimorak's vision; they ignore the [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] condition from smoke.

A creature that enters or begins its turn within the smoke it must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (sickened 2 on a critical failure).</span>

###  The Smallest Sparks

Many underestimate brimoraks due to their size, forgetting that tiny embers can blow into raging infernos in the blink of an eye. Brimoraks believe that they grow larger with each fire they set, though larger arson demons have yet to be seen.
