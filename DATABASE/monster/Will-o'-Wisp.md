description: "Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o\u2019-wisps haunt lonely marshes\
  \ and forests where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o\u2019-wisps\
  \ can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing\
  \ lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails.\
  \ They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they\
  \ enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing\
  \ light in the distance isn\u2019t, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible,\
  \ however, a will-o\u2019-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts\
  \ upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.<br/><br/> Beneath its glow, a will-o\u2019\
  -wisp\u2019s body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing\
  \ less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o\u2019-wisps are merely translucent, featureless\
  \ orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few\
  \ have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o\u2019\
  -wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume\
  \ matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby\
  \ creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror\
  \ in their victims. Will-o\u2019-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal,\
  \ and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o\u2019-wisp can be a good\

  \ but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as\
  \ pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters.\

  \ slowly become aware of the fact that they\u2019re lost produces a much different\
  \ taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering\
  \ monster. Because of this, will-o\u2019-wisps try to vary the ways in which they\
  \ induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don\u2019t tire of certain flavors\

# Will-o’-Wisp

Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o’-wisps haunt lonely marshes and forests where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o’-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn’t, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o’-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.
 Beneath its glow, a will-o’-wisp’s body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o’-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o’-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o’-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories.

###  Eyes of the Dead

The elder goddess Nhimbaloth, the so-called "Empty Death," is said by many to be the source of all will‑o’‑wisps. Cultists of Nhimbaloth claim she has no true form, but is merely a presence that can be felt by all in danger of a pointless and futile death. These same cultists maintain that all will‑o’‑wisps are Nhimbaloth’s eyes, and it is through these fear‑devouring creatures that she looks upon all worlds from an eldritch realm beyond even the very concept of death.

## Will-o’-Wisp Variants

Some variants of this creature have the following alternate rules that adjust the standard will-o’-wisp stat block above. Despite these changes, their level remains the same.

### Dune Candle

**Source** [[Pathfinder 164. Hands of the Devil]]
Dune candles replace the melee Strike, Feed on Fear, and Go Dark abilities with the following abilities.
**Melee** flare +17 (fire, magical), **Damage** 2d4+4 fire plus Light the Living Wick
**Heat Mirage** (concentrate) The dune candle extinguishes its glow, becoming [[Invisible]]. It can end this effect with another use of this action. Its body reflects creatures on fire (but not other fires) while it's invisible. As a result, when any creature within 20 feet of the dune candle is taking [[Persistent Damage]], the dune candle is [[Hidden]] to observers rather than [[Undetected]].
**Light the Living Wick** (arcane, evocation) A creature damaged by a dune candle's flare Strike must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or catch on fire, taking 1d4 persistent fire damage. If the creature is already taking [[Persistent Damage]], a failed save increases the [[Persistent Damage]] by 1d4.

### Groetan Candle

**Source** [[Pathfinder 164. Hands of the Devil]]
Groetan candles deal cold damage with their melee Strikes and gain the following ability.
**Show the Looming Moon** (concentrate) **Requirements** The Groetan candle is [[Invisible]]; **Effect** The Groetan candle ends its invisibility and flashes with cold brightness. Creatures within 20 feet of the Groetan candle who can see it must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become [[Dazzled]] for 1 round (1 minute on a critical failure).

### Spellvoid

**Source** [[Pathfinder 164. Hands of the Devil]]
Spellvoids have the following ability instead of Feed on Fear.
**Feed on Magic** (concentrate) **Requirement** A creature who can cast spells is within 15 feet of the spellvoid; **Effect** The spellvoid feeds on the creature's magic. The spellvoid regains 2d8 Hit Points, and the target must attempt a DC 24 Will save. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
 **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
 **Success** The first time the target Casts a Spell before the start of the spellvoid's next turn, the spell is disrupted unless the target succeeds at a DC 15 flat check.
 **Failure** As success, but the effect applies the first time the target Casts a Spell within the next minute.
 **Critical Failure** As success, but the effect applies each time the target Casts a Spell within the next minute. In addition, the spellvoid doubles the Hit Points it regains.

### Will-o'-the-Deep

**Source** [[Pathfinder 164. Hands of the Devil]]
These creatures gain the Amphibious trait, a swim Speed of 50 feet, and the [[Aquatic Ambush]] ability.
