###  Mysterious Origins

Iffdahsil's path to undeath is unknown. Many believe Iffdahsil can consume and incorporate the souls and minds of its victims, which might explain its spellcasting powers and relatively advanced intellect, though this also gives rise to more unanswerable questions about its horrific nature and unknowable goals.
