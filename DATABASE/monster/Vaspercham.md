# Vaspercham

The darkly intelligent vaspercham, an aquatic horror who delights in violence and destruction, lurks in the shallows near shorelines. Once a vaspercham settles on a new home, they stubbornly stay there, regardless of any communities dwelling nearby. A vaspercham's physical might and magic-warping abilities make them incredibly hard to dislodge once entrenched, and many seaside communities have relocated after a vaspercham came calling. The monster responds only to strength, so one must best a vaspercham in combat to gain their begrudging cooperation. But once the creature recovers their strength, they inevitably betray any temporary alliance.

###  Forbidden Armor

After a devastating battle with a vaspercham, many legendary heroes have tried to forge armor or weapons from the magical shell of the sea beast, but all have failed because of the powerful curse that suffuses the opaline material. If one were able to dispel the curse of a vaspercham's shell - or somehow twist the curse to their own benefit - they would be able to craft an incredible suit of spell-reflecting plate mail.
