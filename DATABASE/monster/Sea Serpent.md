# Sea Serpent

These fabled beasts resemble massive snakes with long rows of finned spines down their back. Temperamental and territorial, sea serpents can capsize a boat with ease, and most won’t hesitate to do so when hungry or threatened. Stories abound of aggrieved captains who spend their entire lives hunting down the elusive monster that sunk their ships and took their livelihoods. These hunts rely on rumors and glimpses of the beasts, as few survive the catastrophes wrought by sea serpents.
 While many fishermen’s tales paint sea serpents as divinely appointed guardians of the ocean or, alternately, as evil and demonic agents, the truth is that most sea serpents are simply very large beasts with a knack for avoiding magical detection.

###  Sea Serpent Lairs

While an underwater cave will do, sea serpents prefer to “build” lairs by sinking ships. A sea serpent might even create a massive underwater graveyard by crashing several ships in the same location and letting the debris stack up on the ocean floor.
