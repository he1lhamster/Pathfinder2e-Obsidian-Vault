# Redcap Cavalry

Whomever first imagined putting a fey with a bloodsoaked hat on a giant blood-crazed insect certainly had a sense of humor, but that didn't stop the redcaps from trying to domesticate and train giant bloodseekers. Although a flying cavalry was Queen Frilogarma's goal, her court ended up accidentally inventing redcap racing. In this sport, one redcap with a freshly soaked cap is swung around a racetrack by a giant arm while several other redcaps on giant bloodseekers fly after them. The “bait” redcap doesn't usually survive, but they are the center of attention for about two minutes.
