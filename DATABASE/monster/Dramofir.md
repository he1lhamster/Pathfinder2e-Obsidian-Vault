# Dramofir

Beings of inscrutable intent and incredible power, dramofirs hail from the [[Dreamlands]] and shamble across the multiverse in search of dreams to incorporate into their voluminous robes. Few people on the [[Material Plane]] dare trifle with dramofirs and instead treat them with respect, hoping that they'll simply take their chosen victims' dreams and then go away. Often, this is exactly what happens. Every now and then, however, in the process of siphoning an individual's dreams, the dramofir slays their victim without warning or apparent cause.

Each creature within 30 feet must attempt a DC 34 Will save or be filled with ennui. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune for 24 hours. 
**Success** For 1 round, the creature takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and all other emotion effects on it are suppressed. 
**Failure** As success, but the creature is also [[Slowed]] and the duration is 1d4 rounds.

If the target is affected by any mental effect altering their dreams, such as an [[Animate Dream]] curse of endless nightmares or a [[Nightmare]] spell, the dramofir attempts to counteract that effect (counteract modifier +26). Otherwise, the dramofir plucks a benign dream from the creature, and the target must attempt a DC 36 Will save. 
**Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Failure** The creature is [[Stupefied]] until the next time it gets a full night's rest. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but stupefied 2, and the dramofir casts a 6th-level [[Modify Memory]] spell on the target.</span>

###  Animate Dream Tamers

[[Animate Dream]] despise dramofirs, who in turn regard animate dreams with, strangely, an emotion akin to pity. Communities plagued by an animate dream sometimes search out and beseech a dramofir to put an end to the terrifying menace.
