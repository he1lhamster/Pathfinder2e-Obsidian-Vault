# Fluxwraith

To cheat mortality, the rare spellcaster turns to potent temporal stasis magic, or even cryogenic technology. However, such methods are highly unreliable and often fracture the sleeper's soul across the time stream as their physical body perishes. Such an individual can rise as a fluxwraith, an incorporeal undead with a kaleidoscopic consciousness.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Terrible Foresight** (divination, mental, occult, prediction) A creature struck by the fluxwraith's temporal fracturing ray receives a glimpse of a possible tragic event in its future. It must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] (slowed 2 and stupefied 2 on a critical failure). If the creature is already affected by terrible foresight, it increases its stupefied value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of stupefied 4. Each time the creature gets a full night's rest, its condition values from terrible foresight decrease by 1.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Time Shift** (occult, transmutation) A creature struck by the fluxwraith's time-shifting touch must succeed at a DC 35 Will saving throw or be thrust forward in time, vanishing from its space. The target automatically reappears in the same location after 1d4 rounds but can attempt an additional Will save at the end of each of its turns to end the duration. If its original space is occupied when it returns, the creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space. Since the creature is shunted forward in time, it doesn't experience any of the intervening time. Likewise, any effects on the creature with a duration don't decrease their duration, resuming when the creature reappears. A creature that succeeds at any saving throw against time shift is temporarily immune for 1 hour.</span>

###  Creating a Fluxwraith

A powerful necromancer can try to create a fluxwraith by subjecting someone to unstable temporal magic, usually by inflicting it on an unwilling victim. If the process succeeds, the created fluxwraith typically holds no loyalty to the necromancer and often turns its newfound powers on them first. A wise creator ensures they're nowhere nearby when the fluxwraith rises from death.
