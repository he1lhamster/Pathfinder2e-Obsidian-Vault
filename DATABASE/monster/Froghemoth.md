# Froghemoth

A terrifying abomination of teeth, tentacles, and unbridled rage, the froghemoth is thankfully rarely encountered even in the deepest swamplands or most remote Darklands caverns. Capable of devouring dinosaurs and even dragons, it is a frighteningly effective ambush hunter, immersing itself in the mire with only its eyestalk protruding and watching in every direction at once with uncanny precision.

**Otherworldly Vision** A froghemoth's alien eyes allow it to perceive creatures within 30 feet, even if they are invisible or ethereal. It can still be fooled by successful [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]], but it has Perception DC 38 in such cases. It also sees through and is unaffected by illusions with the visual trait if they are within 30 feet.

###  Alien Origins

Froghemoths have been known to suddenly abandon an established lair to seek a new home, as if in response to some cosmic convergence or subspace signal imperceptible to other creatures. Some argue that the froghemoth is never fully comfortable in any environment because it isn't from this world at all, and that these wanderings are instinctual urges to seek out its true home—a home not represented by the strange world in which the beast finds itself trapped.
