# Pairaka

Often charming, sometimes even seductive, pairakas worm their way into mortal relationships, subtly destroying the ties of friendship and love through emotional and physical corruption and plague. Pairakas appear as beautiful, blue-skinned humanoids spotted with large rashes and boils, but they rarely take on their true forms. Instead, they adopt shapes that attract just enough attention for them to worm their way into the confidences of those they wish to torment and corrupt.
