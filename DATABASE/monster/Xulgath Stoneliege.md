# Xulgath Stoneliege

Stonelieges are xulgaths magically infused with living earth—the very bones of the world. They are created through a process xulgaths call stone-binding, which can be performed with complex alchemy, powerful psychic magic, or Abyssal rituals. Their scales are like stone slabs, and their bones are as dense as bedrock, so they are among the hardiest and longest-lived xulgaths. To stonelieges, earth is as mutable as water, and their innate power to shape the soil and stone beneath their feet makes them integral members of xulgath society (as well as formidable combatants).

###  Role within the Clutch

A stoneliege’s power reinforces common xulgath values of dominance and control. This makes stone-binding a mark of prestige, given to the strongest or most clever members of a clutch. The former relish in the destructive potential of their newfound power, while the latter use their abilities to build structures or shape their clutch’s home cavern.
