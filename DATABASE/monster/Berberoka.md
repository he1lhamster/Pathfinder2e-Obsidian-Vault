# Berberoka

Berberokas are giant humanoids who live among forests and swamps, where they use their ability to swallow massive amounts of water to drain small ponds and lakes. Creatures who visit their favorite watering hole and find only an empty mud basin become prey for the berberoka, who hides in the brush and overwhelm their prey with a massive torrent of regurgitated water.
 A berberoka's mottled backside—which resembles a bundle of local plants, small trees, and large rocks—grants them natural camouflage that allows them to hide in plain sight. Berberokas tend to disguise themselves as rock formations in the center of a dried-up waterbed while they lie in wait for passersby. In the tropical regions where berberokas are most common, locals know to give empty ponds a wide berth, regardless of the enticing fish flopping about. Hungry travelers, on the other hand, might see such bounty as a blessing from the gods, only to be swept up in the berberoka's deadly deluge.

###  Kabourophobia

[[DATABASE/monster/Berberoka|Berberokas]] share an unusually intense fear of crabs, so many folktales suggest fishers bring a crab with them should they suspect a berberoka nearby. If no crab is available, clicking one's tongue or snapping one's fingers might suffice.
