# Nyktera

Nykteras, or bat sprites, are gentle sprites known for their affectionate nature and incredible hospitality. Nykteras share features with bats, but the type of bat varies by location, as nykteras tend to form small colonies in locations with bats similar to their own nature. A nyktera's sense of hospitality is such that they're willing to share with any who need it, even bitter foes. However, violating a nyktera's hospitality is one of their greatest taboos, inviting rare anger and retribution from the nyktera who was wronged, as well as their large extended family.

**Speak with Bats** A nyktera can communicate with bats and use [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on bats and [[DATABASE/action/Request|Request]] things from bats.
**Wrath of Spurned Hospitality** A nyktera whose hospitality is betrayed becomes enraged at the violation of a fundamental aspect of their fey nature. They must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or begin involuntarily attacking the traitor. At the end of each of their turns, if they choose, they can attempt another Will save to end the effect; otherwise, the effect lasts until the traitor is subdued or leaves the nyktera's presence. As long as their righteous fury lasts, the nyktera gains a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for their fist Strikes.
