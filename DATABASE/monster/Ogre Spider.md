# Ogre Spider

These terrifying creatures grow as large as elephants. The placement of their eyes above their wide mandibles evokes the grimacing visage of an ogre's leer. [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ogre|Ogres]] themselves find the appearance of ogre spider faces simultaneously amusing and adorable, but in most cases, ogres' attempts to keep these spiders as pets result in dead ogres and well-fed spiders.
