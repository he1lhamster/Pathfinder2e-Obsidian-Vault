# Gennayn

Gennayns are minor genies who often serve as emissaries and messengers for greater elemental beings. While many find purpose in this humble mission, their true calling and interest is in the arts.
 They often appear as miniature, athletic humanoids with wisps of elemental energy continually dissipating from their bodies. These elemental energies often reflect their emotions and attuned element. Gennayns are also fond of ostentatious rings, amulets, and armbands.
 Gennayns eagerly assist powerful beings who reward and treat them well, but they're just as quick to abandon those they consider boring, stingy, or abusive. Beings who destroy artwork or mistreat artists will earn their eternal wrath.

###  Artistic Inspiration

Talented individuals often claim to have been inspired by otherworldly forces. As gennayns are known to share inspiration and develop talent, many scholars and artists believe their aptitude unknowingly benefited from a gennayn's attention. Others speculate that being in a gennayn's good graces can stave off bouts of artistic ennui—or that angering a gennayn is a direct path to creative doldrums. Gennayns themselves don't claim to be muses, merely beings drawn to talent.
