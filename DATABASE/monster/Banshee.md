# Banshee

Banshees are the furious, tormented souls of elves bound to the Material Plane by a betrayal that defined the final hours of their lives. Some banshees arise from elves who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from elves whose treacherous deeds shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin, banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horrific inversion of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the elf (and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.
 Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many banshees can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, specifically in Tanglebriar, the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees can be found lurking about the edges of drow settlements in the Darklands, as plenty of cruelty and betrayal exists in drow culture.
 Banshees’ mere touch inflicts pain and primal fear, and those exposed to their wails of grief rarely survive the experience.

This Wail overcomes _[[DATABASE/spell/Silence|silence]]_ and similar effects of 5th level or lower. The banshee can instead use Wail as a three-action activity to overcome such effects of up to 8th level.
 The banshee’s Wail resonates for 1 round, and any creature that comes within the area during that time must attempt a save against the effect. A creature can’t be affected more than once by the same Wail. The banshee can’t Wail again for 1d4 rounds.</span>

###  Born from Tragedy

The banshee represents one of the most tragic of undead, a soul so wracked with agony and fury over a betrayal in life that, in death, it lingers on as a great evil. That most of those who become banshees were not evil in life only deepens this tragic theme, and many elven adventurers see it as their duty not only to put banshees to rest, but to right the wrong that saw their creation in the first place.
