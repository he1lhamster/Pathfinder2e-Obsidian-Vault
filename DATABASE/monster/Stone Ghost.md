# Stone Ghost, Spite-Filled Apparation and Failed Student

As a young man, Uduak Basni seemed like a typical Magaambyan initiate. Born with a supernatural connection to the earth, he found himself drawn to the Magaambya. To the professors at the academy, Uduak was an obvious candidate for the school's education. He easily found a sponsor and was set upon his Perquisite to become a full-fledged attendant.
 Yet Uduak had a selfish streak. The pull he felt toward the Magaambya quickly bred a sense of entitlement. Feeling that he was meant to be building his own skills at the academy, he felt resentful about the community service he felt was being forced upon him. He performed his tasks with little effort and little concern for the people he was supposedly helping. Cracks began to form in his mild demeanor, and he increasingly drew reprimands for acts of carelessness or petty cruelty. Everything came to a head when his cohort was tasked with removing a group of [[Pugwampi]] gremlins that had started causing mischief within the academy walls. Ignoring the spirited discussions of his fellow initiates, Uduak used his magic to slaughter the gremlins like vermin.
 The aftermath saw Uduak expelled from the school. It was the last straw in a long series of misdeeds, but the young man fixated on this one event, enraged that the school would rob him of his future over defending himself and his classmates from a group of mere pests. In his anger, he lashed out violently at the school and the teachers. His magic bounced off the ancient wards of the Magaambya like a pebble off a cliff, and the professors temporarily confined Uduak until the administration could decide what to do with him. Left to stew in his own resentment, Uduak ignored his guard's warning, drew on all of his strength, and attempted to shatter the spells that kept him imprisoned within his room.
 Under predictable circumstances, Uduak's magic would have splashed futilely against the Magaambya's wards once more, leaving his efforts entirely impotent. Yet magic is never entirely predictable—or perhaps the murdered pugwampis got one last scrap of revenge. In an incredibly unlikely reaction, the Magaambya's wards rebounded onto Uduak with the full force of their power. So far as any teacher at the school could tell, this reaction evaporated Uduak on the spot.
 The student that was Uduak was not gone, however, but found himself merged with the Magaambya's stone walls. The same wards that originally trapped him within the buildings now protected him from detection, and Uduak decided to use this to his advantage. He hid himself in an abandoned section of the school and began planning his vengeance. His first recruits to his cause were an assorted group of gremlins that snuck into the school with no clue as to the recent massacre of their kind. Through a series of promises and threats, the cursed student took command of the gremlins, considering it fitting that the initiators of his downfall would now serve him against the teachers who had so wronged him. The gremlins, impressed and fearful of their new leader's ability to move through stone walls, granted him a new moniker: Stone Ghost.
 Stone Ghost resembles a young man with a body made out of chunks of stone, his faceted skin matching the blocks that make up the Magaambya campus. His hair and face are made of ruined mosaics, and his body is covered in fragmentary runes: the shattered remains of the magic wards that caused his current condition. With nothing to temper his cruelty, Stone Ghost is abusive both in and out of combat. During his spare time, he shifts through walls to steal important items, learn secrets, and ruin friendships.

## Campaign Role

Stone Ghost serves as the villain of this adventure. He's a spiteful and self-centered antagonist convinced he's been victimized and willing to take out his feelings on the vulnerable. Due to his fear of the Magaambyan teachers, he almost always targets weak and innocent school initiates or adjuncts, punishing them for their mere association with the professors. He has recently worked to corral the insects and other creatures— including gremlins—that have been mysteriously drawn to the school, waiting for the perfect moment to unleash them for his own ends. As his minions can't move about the academy as easily has he can, Stone Ghost has set them to digging tunnels while he plans sabotage on a grand scale.
 Stone Ghost isn't undead, but neither is he still living. His connection to elemental earth allows him to still take physical form, but in truth, he's closer to his new moniker in nature than he can understand or admit, even to himself. The former student is nothing more than a hateful will unmoored from a body, and the only way to free his tormented spirit to a peaceful afterlife is to destroy him.
