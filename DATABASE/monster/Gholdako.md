# Gholdako

[[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Cyclops|Cyclops]] necromancers created gholdakos untold ages ago by performing foul rituals over the corpses of their fellow cyclopes. Although these rituals varied through the history of Ghol-Gan, each involved the sacrifice of numerous humanoids whose blood was used to write the runes scribed upon a gholdako's linens. Rarely, a cyclops initiated their own transformation into a gholdako, scribing runes glimpsed from oracular visions and fevered dreams on their clothes or carving them into their bare flesh. Regardless of their origin, gholdakos are guardians, bound beyond death to protect a location, relic, or person—often the same thing they once defended in life.
 Despite their death and subsequent reanimation, gholdakos retain many of the quirks of living cyclopes, including their ceaseless hunger, volatile temper, single-mindedness, and great strength.

###  Forgotten Faith

Throughout the time of fallen Ghol-Gan, the [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Cyclops|cyclopes]] worshipped numerous gods, from the sun and moon to alien beings, interdimensional horrors, nightmarish monsters, and worse. Although many of these gods were forgotten in the ensuing millennia, some gholdakos carry their faith forward into the present, performing profane, blood-soaked rituals to their cruel gods even now.
