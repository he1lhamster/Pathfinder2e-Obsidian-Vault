# Hobgoblin General

Hobgoblin generals serve as leaders of entire armies and rulers of hobgoblin settlements. A general does not permit the luxuries of rule to soften them. They lead their forces on the field of battle and view this opportunity to excel in a fight at the head of an army as the true reward for a life spent honing one’s skills in battle.

**General’s Cry** When a hobgoblin general rolls initiative, as long as they can perceive at least one foe, they can yell a mighty battle cry. The hobgoblin general attempts an Intimidate check to Demoralize a single foe within 60 feet as a free action. If successful, any ally with the goblin trait can, as its first action on its first turn of the combat, Stride up to double its speed as a single action.
