# Archon, Wheel

Among the most terrifying archons to behold, and easily the most difficult for mortals to comprehend, is the wheel archon, so named for its appearance as a flying, armor-plated wheel of fire with eyes on each spoke. Wheel archons often serve as messengers or harbingers for the armies of heaven, as their stubborn, indomitable natures make them ill-suited for missions requiring diplomacy or tact. Indeed, they have a legendary intolerance and single-mindedness in the pursuit of the punishment of evil.
 Wheel archons can't tolerate deceit and easily see through lies. The sensation of this celestial being's divine eyes all fixing upon a single target is usually enough to encourage honesty, but when a wheel archon detects a falsehood, their righteous wrath takes over and they mete out punishment to sinners without quarter.

###  Unforgiving Archons

More so than other archons, the wheel archon's view of good and evil is rigid, almost to the point of absolute inflexibility. They carry out other celestials' instructions to the letter—sometimes in ways that incur grave consequences when they're faced with situations that would be served better with moderation and forgiveness. A wheel archon never regrets or feels remorse for their actions, as they see themself as an arbiter of heavenly law.
