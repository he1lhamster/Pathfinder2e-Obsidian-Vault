description: "Perhaps the most perverse asuras of them all, shaukeens particularly\
  \ delight in causing the downfall of those who give them succor, shelter, and most\
  \ of all, schooling. Many a teacher has come across a shaukeen disguised as a small\
  \ child of exceptional talents or curiosity and taken them under their wing, only\
  \ to be beguiled into ruin. This diminutive asura's cleverness is disproportionate\
  \ to their size; they ask probing questions and coax their prey into decisions that\
  \ lead to heresy, furthering the collapse of order and decency. When the world turns\
  \ on the shaukeen's mentor, the asura is gone\u2014but not very far, for they love\

# Shemhazian (Mutilation Demon)

Shemhazians rise from the souls of torturers and those who reveled in mutilating the physical bodies of their victims. Standing 35 feet tall, a shemhazian is well equipped with a wide range of talons, claws, and fangs to continue inflicting such torments on those it encounters.
 Shemhazians delight in visiting torment upon mortals, of course, but more than most demons, these fiends revel in sharing the pain with their own kind. Other demons fear and hate shemhazians for this reason, with only the most powerful willing to work with a shemhazian to achieve a shared goal. Even then, the shemhazian is always on the watch for an opportunity to bring pain and suffering to its allies along with any foe.
