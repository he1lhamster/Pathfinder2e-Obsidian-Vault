# Wereant Poisoner

When overwhelming force is inadvisable, a wereant hive sends a poison-dripping assassin for murderous work. These poisoners love to terrify those dying in agony from their toxins.

**Hive Mind** (divination, primal) Wereants operate with a shared hive intelligence. While within telepathic range of at least one other wereant, a wereant disciple gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative checks, Perception checks, and saving throws against mental effects. If one wereant is aware of a combatant, all members of the hive mind within telepathic range are aware of it.
**Insect Empathy** (divination, primal) The wereant can communicate with insects.
