**HP** 240; **Thresholds** 160 (12 squares), 80 (8 squares); **Immunities** bleed, death effects, disease, [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]], fire, healing, magic, mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], poison, [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]]; **Resistances** physical 15 (except [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine|adamantine]] and bludgeoning); **Weaknesses** area damage 15, bludgeoning 10, splash damage 8
<span class="in-box-ability">**Death Throes** As the garrison's numbers dwindle, gold defenders melt away into worthless slag. Every time that the garrison is reduced to a threshold, it leaves behind a 10-foot radius cloud of fumes and a 10-foot radius puddle of molten metal. Creatures that breathe fumes are exposed to gold defender poison. Creatures that move through the puddle take 10d6 fire damage. The fumes dissipate after 1 round and the puddle completely evaporates after 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Golem Antimagic** harmed by cold (2d8 from areas and [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]]); healed by fire (area 2d8 HP); [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] by acid</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Troop Defenses|Troop Defenses]]** </span>

The damage depends on the number of actions. 
 <span class="action-icon">1</span> 2d8+2 bludgeoning damage 
 <span class="action-icon">2</span> 3d8+12 bludgeoning damage 
 <span class="action-icon">3</span> 4d8+15 bludgeoning damage</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Gold Defender Poison** (poison) Any [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]] value from this poison is reduced by 1 every hour; **Saving Throw** DC 33 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 4 rounds; **Stage 1** 2d6 poison and drained 1 (1 round); **Stage 2** 4d6 poison and drained 2 (1 round); **Stage 3** 8d6 poison and drained 3 (1 round).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Light Reflection** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (primal, evocation) **Requirements** The gold defender is not in darkness; **Effect** The gold defender reshapes its skin into a reflective surface that magnifies ambient light into a precise beam that burns all creatures in a 30-foot cone, dealing 14d6 fire damage (DC 31 Reflex save if the gold defender is in dim light, DC 33 Reflex save if it's in bright light). It can't use Light Reflection again for 1d4 rounds. When the garrison is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 15-foot cone. 
**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage. 
**Success** The creature takes half damage. 
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and catches fire, taking 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]]. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the persistent fire damage is 5d6.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Troop Movement** Whenever the garrison Strides, it first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to its Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop.</span>
