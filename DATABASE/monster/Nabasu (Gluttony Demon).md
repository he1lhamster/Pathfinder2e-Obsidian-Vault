# Nabasu (Gluttony Demon)

Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material Plane from the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]], an invasive infestation that releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life. Nabasus feed on sapient creatures, but they never quite manage to sate their eternal hunger, even as they grow more and more powerful. Once they have sufficiently feasted, the demons become worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo a vile transformation, finally digesting their accumulated meals and deforming further into powerful [[DATABASE/monster/Vrolikai (Death Demon)|vrolikais]].
Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those who prefer the tang of undead flesh.

###  Nabasu Growth

A nabasu stores their stolen deaths until they finally become satiated. For most, this occurs after consuming death from at least 100 mortals, but the exact timing is left to the GM. The demon then travels to the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] and transforms into a [[DATABASE/monster/Vrolikai (Death Demon)|vrolikai]].
