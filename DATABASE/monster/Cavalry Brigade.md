description: "The life of a Hellknight is bloody, brutal, and often short. Many who\
  \ perish in service to a Hellknight order are glad to rest after having served their\
  \ masters so faithfully, but others seek to continue their work even in death. When\
  \ a Hellknight is decapitated, the ghostly undead known as a hellcrown is an occasional\
  \ result. Consumed by the desire to bring about order by inflicting cruelty, hellcrowns\
  \ haunt battlefields and abandoned castles, slaying all they encounter. A strange\
  \ fusion of spirit and steel, a hellcrown has no corporeal form by itself, but instead\
  \ inhabits the helmet it so proudly wore in life. Dangling from the helmet like\
  \ a shroud is a shadow of the former Hellknight\u2019s spine, adding to the creature\u2019\
  s terrifyingly gruesome appearance. Hellknights regard hellcrowns with a mixture\
  \ of disgust and respect, considering the individuals who transform into these floating\
  \ undead to have been resolute in purpose but weak in body.<br/><br/> A hellcrown\
  \ usually manifests hours or longer after its body\u2019s death, and only when its\
  \ body is unattended; this might even take days if the Hellknight perished in a\
  \ major battle. Typically, no recognizable fragment of the Hellknight\u2019s former\
  \ personality survives the grisly transformation into a hellcrown, but in rare and\
  \ particularly tragic cases a hellcrown might remember its life and hold grudges\
  \ against those it views as the cause of its death. Regardless of whether they retain\
  \ memories of their lives or have lost all former sense of self, hellcrowns linger\
  \ around the site of their death, reminding all they encounter of the merciless\
  \ principles of their order.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Undead</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]]\

# Cavalry Brigade

A cavalry brigade consists of several Hellknights and a single field-maralictor, in the distinctive armor of their order and bearing lances; the maralictor speaks for the brigade, questioning travelers the brigade encounters and barking orders. A Hellknight brigade is typically based at a keep or other fortification controlling an area measured by a day's ride in every direction—about 25 miles. Farther-ranging missions are possible but require substantial logistical support.

###  Troop Gear

Since the component members of a troop are individually much less powerful than the troop as a whole, a troop's gear is typically of negligible utility or value. This troop's [[DATABASE/armor/Hellknight Plate|Hellknight plate]] is an exception, and a party might be able to salvage a suit or two from their defeated foes—if they're willing to risk the wrath of the Order of the Nail!
