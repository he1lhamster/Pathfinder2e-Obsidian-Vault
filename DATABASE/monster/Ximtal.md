# Ximtal

The struggles of loneliness and the anxiety that accompanies that feeling plague many creatures, and ximtals delight in exploiting this fear for their own perverse gain. Appearing as hybrids of rats and crabs with grasping tentacles, these scheming fiends manipulate their victims over long spans of time, like pakalchis, to savor the most fear they can. Ximtals use subtlety to entrap their prey and often don't directly engage their targets. They use insecurities as a tool and force poor behavior in mortals they set their sights on. They prefer to focus their machinations on strong-willed and well-intentioned mortals, hoping to erode their pride and self-worth and ultimately lead them eschew altruistic efforts.
 Rather than focusing on a single victim, a ximtal might instead seek out a particular cause of interest to the sahkil's appetites. These creatures often wander the multiverse seeking to sabotage societal crusades or suppress divergent ideologies.
 While most ximtals work alone, they sometimes enlist the assistance of pakalchis, who share similar tastes in mortal fear. Together and focused, these two types of fiends can dissolve individual self-worth, relationships, and even entire organizations.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Isolate Foes** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (curse, divine, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The ximtal attempts to isolate its enemy's companions, forcing an impression that each creature's friends and allies have vanished and they are all alone against an insurmountable threat. The ximtal chooses up to four creatures, each of whom must be adjacent to one other target. Each target must attempt a DC 38 Will save. On a failure, a target becomes out of phase with all allies. The affected creatures can't perceive their allies or interact with them in any way, and they can move into allies' spaces as if their allies simply weren't there. Allies similarly can't perceive or interact with the affected creatures with one exception: an ally can target an effected creature with [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Curse|remove curse]] to remove the effects. Every 24 hours, an affected creature can attempt a new saving throw to end this effect.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Sensory Fever** (disease) A ximtal's withering attacks cause a debilitating disease targeting the senses; **Saving Throw** DC 36 Fortitude; **Stage 1** creature loses one sense determined randomly: taste, smell, hearing, or sight (1 day); **Stage 2** creature loses an additional sense from the stage 1 list (1 day); **Stage 3** creature loses an additional sense from the stage 1 list (1 day); **Stage 4** creature loses the last sense from the stage 1 list and any special senses, such as [[DATABASE/monsterability/Tremorsense|tremorsense]] or [[DATABASE/monsterability/Lifesense|lifesense]] (1 day); **Stage 5** all lost senses are permanent unless restored via [[DATABASE/spell/Restore Senses|restore senses]] or a similar effect</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Skip Between** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (conjuration, divine, teleportation) The sahkil moves from the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] to the [[DATABASE/plane/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]] or vice-versa, with the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Ethereal Jaunt|ethereal jaunt]] except that the effect has an unlimited duration and can be Dismissed.
