# Dig-Widget

Thieves covet dig-widgets, specialized constructs built for infiltration. Each dig-widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices that function as [[Thieves' Tools]], two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel themselves forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct, they usually follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path, dig past obstacles, and attack if caught. They're rarely left unattended, as a thief needs to be nearby to follow after-both to steal goods and to stop the dig-widget from engaging in further larceny once it's achieved its goal.
 The source of a dig-widget's power is as much mechanical as it is magical. The gears and springs that provide a dig-widget mobility are an improvement over more primitive true clockwork creations (whose functions require constant winding to remain mobile), but at the cost of security, for a dig-widget's moving parts can be dismantled quickly by thieves and others with the proper training.

If the Strike damages the target, the dig-widget attaches to the target (typically to the back of a creature). This is similar to [[Grab]] the creature, but the dig-widget moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. While attached, the dig-widget can't use its corkscrew. The dig-widget can be [[Shove]] off, or it can detach itself with an Interact action.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Sneak Attack]]** A dig-widget's Strikes deal an additional 1d6 precision damage to [[Flat-Footed]] creatures.</span>

###  Widget Workshops

The first dig-widget came from the workshops of a [[Dwarf]] thieves' guild called Godak's Grifters, which used more advanced magical clockwork theories as a springboard for these simpler but no less effective contraptions. With their dig-widgets, the Grifters plagued the authorities of several dwarven settlements over the years. Their travels spread dig-widget technology, and numerous improvements have since led to faster and more reliable versions. Though upstanding dwarven mechanics have observed dig-widgets and recognized the complexity of the technology, they've steadfastly refused to adapt something with such an unscrupulous origin.
