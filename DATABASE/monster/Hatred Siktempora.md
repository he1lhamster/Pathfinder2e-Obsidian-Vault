# Hatred Siktempora

Spawned by acts and legacies of cold-blooded spite, hatred siktemporas kill indiscriminately out of pure loathing, methodically hunting down and slaughtering anyone who catches their vile attention. Fortunately for mortals, they typically limit their predations to the [[DATABASE/plane/Dimension of Time|Dimension of Time]], where they hunt down creatures foreign to that realm—and some native to it.
 Hatred siktemporas appear roughly humanoid, but their gaunt forms resemble bone and tendon more than flesh and skin. Adding to their unnerving appearance, their legs have an additional segment between their shin and thigh, and likewise for their eerily long arms. Their featureless faces bear only a singular scar, which takes a different form on every hatred siktempora. They clad themselves in immaculate finery chosen from the most vitriolic empires that ever existed, in the past and the future, and they form a magical garrote as a manifestation of their cold malice.
