The light lasts until the start of the crystal sentinel's next turn, after which the crystal sentinel can't use Dazzling Brilliance for 1d4 rounds. A creature caught within the bright light or that enters the bright light must attempt a DC 33 Will save.

 **Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round.
 **Critical Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round, and then dazzled for an additional 4 rounds. While the creature remains dazzled, it's also [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] (this additional effect has the emotion and mental traits).</span>
