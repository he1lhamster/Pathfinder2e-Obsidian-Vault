### Kothogaz's Destruction

Many legends exist detailing methods of Kothogaz's final destruction. The most popular story is of the [[Raga of Remembrance]], a performance powerful enough to summon the spirits of the millions who opposed Kothogaz so long ago. The raga's drone builds from a disharmonic instrument crafted with pieces of the beast's heart, and once the song swells, the musician becomes an anchor for the avatar of the legendary psychic Vanitapati.

### [[Craft Disharmonic Instrument]]

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Downtime</span><span class="item-trait">Manipulate</span>
**Source** [[Monsters of Myth]]
**Requirements** Legendary in [[Crafting]]

---
You use legendary Vudran techniques to craft a disharmonic instrument that incorporates pieces of [[Kothogaz, Dance Of Disharmony]] heart. This is likely a tanpura, but legends mention other instruments and even voice enhancers. A disharmonic instrument is a [[Musical Instrument]].
 This activity requires seven [[Harvest Heartsliver]], the formula for a disharmonic instrument, 55,000 gp worth of rare materials, and 7 days of work. At the end of the 7 days, attempt a DC 40 Crafting check to [[Craft]].
**Critical Success** You masterfully complete the disharmonic instrument. Holding the instrument grants immunity to Kothogaz's tympanic heartbeat and many-eyed blight.
**Success** You complete the disharmonic instrument.
**Failure** You don't complete the disharmonic instrument, and you contract [[Kothogaz, Dance Of Disharmony]] from the heartslivers.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and whenever you're on the same plane as Kothogaz, it can immediately teleport to you with its Disharmonic Door ability.
