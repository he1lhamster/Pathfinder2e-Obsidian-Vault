Xerbystes II has had his palace spellcasters work to develop ways to replicate the great powers of the genie-touched horses of Qadira. These spellcasters have a rudimentary method in place that can grant such power to any animal companion, infusing them with elemental power and granting them otherworldly insight. Xerbystes will sometimes gift these companions as a favor to others or have his spellcasters infuse the companions of trusted allies.
 If you take a feat that would normally allow you to choose to have a savage or nimble animal companion, you can instead choose to for it to become a genie-touched companion. When you choose the feat, select the type of genie whose power infuses your companion. The genies and their elemental traits are as follows: [[DATABASE/monster/Djinni|djinni]] (air), [[DATABASE/monster/Efreeti|efreeti]] (fire), [[DATABASE/monster/Marid|marid]] (water), or [[DATABASE/monster/Shaitan|shaitan]] (earth). A genie-touched companion increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks; this damage is fire damage for an efreet-touched companion or of the same type as the unarmed attack for the others. It gains resistance 5 to damage of a type depending on the genie: acid for djinni, fire for efreeti or marid, and electricity for shaitan. If the companion is djinni-touched or efreeti-touched, increase its proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] to expert; if it is marid-touched or shaitan-touched, increase its proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type. Its attacks count as magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances and gain the genie's elemental trait.
