Cryptid animal companions look a touch peculiar, often with uncanny features or ones that seem to come from a different animal. If you take a feat that would normally allow you to choose to have your companion become a savage or nimble animal companion, you can choose to make it an unseen animal companion instead. An unseen companion increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks and deals an extra 1d4 precision damage against [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] targets (if the animal companion already deals precision damage, such as a cat, combine the precision damage). Increase its proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type.
