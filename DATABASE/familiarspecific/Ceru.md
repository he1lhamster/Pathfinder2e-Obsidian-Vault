Your ceru familiar grants you the [[DATABASE/spell/Mage Hand|mage hand]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Guidance|guidance]] cantrips via the cantrip connection granted ability. If one or more of these cantrips isn't on your spell list, you can replace the cantrip or cantrips not on your spell list with a cantrip or cantrips from your spell list instead.

**Frequency** once per day; **Range** 30 feet ; **Effect** Your ceru shifts the scales of fortune for one target's next attempt at an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. If targeted with bad fortune, the target attempts a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, with effects depending on the result of their save; this is a misfortune effect. If targeted with good fortune, the target rolls twice and uses the better result; this is a fortune effect. Regardless of outcome, targets are immune to Turn of Fate for one day.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The target rolls twice and uses the worse result.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is affected for the next three attempts.
