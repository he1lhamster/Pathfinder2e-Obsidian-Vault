# Talking Head

<span class="item-trait">Undead</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Required Number of Abilities** 3
**Granted Abilities** [[DATABASE/familiarability/Cantrip Connection|cantrip connection]], [[DATABASE/familiarability/Skilled|skilled (your choice of arcana, occultism, or one kind of lore)]], [[DATABASE/familiarability/Speech|speech]]
Similar to [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Beheaded|beheaded]], these disembodied, reanimated heads (with or without skin) retain some of their arcane wisdom, making for invaluable study partners. However, they also tend to be mouthy, opinionated, or downright obnoxious with their constant chattering, leading some annoyed masters to sew their mouths shut in punishment.

Your familiar is undead. It has [[DATABASE/monsterability/Negative Healing|negative healing]] and is immune to death effects, disease, poison, and [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]]. It's destroyed at 0 HP.

Unless its master gives the talking head the [[DATABASE/familiarability/Flier|flier]] ability, a talking head is able to move only by rolling along the ground, reducing its speed to 15 feet. Alternatively, a creature can, as a single action, kick or throw the head 30 feet. This can't be used as an attack; the head bounces harmlessly off anything it hits.
