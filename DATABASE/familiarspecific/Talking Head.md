# Talking Head

<span class="item-trait">Undead</span>
**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Required Number of Abilities** 3
**Granted Abilities** [[Cantrip Connection]], [[Skilled]], [[Speech]]
Similar to [[Beheaded]], these disembodied, reanimated heads (with or without skin) retain some of their arcane wisdom, making for invaluable study partners. However, they also tend to be mouthy, opinionated, or downright obnoxious with their constant chattering, leading some annoyed masters to sew their mouths shut in punishment.

## [[Undead]]

**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
Your familiar is undead. It has [[Negative Healing]] and is immune to death effects, disease, poison, and [[Unconscious]]. It's destroyed at 0 HP.

## [[Heads Will Roll]]

**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
Unless its master gives the talking head the [[Flier]] ability, a talking head is able to move only by rolling along the ground, reducing its speed to 15 feet. Alternatively, a creature can, as a single action, kick or throw the head 30 feet. This can't be used as an attack; the head bounces harmlessly off anything it hits.
