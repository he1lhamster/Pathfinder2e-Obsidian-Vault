Calligraphy wyrms are curious dragons constantly in search of new lore and writing. They make natural allies for Pathfinders. While knowledgeable, calligraphy wyrms can also be know-it-alls. Their chirpy, high-pitched voices make this attitude humorous to some and insufferable to others.

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Effect** The wyrm splatters ink in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save or become covered in ink. Ink spray has the effects of glitterdust except the creature isn't dazzled, and it can remove its blindness by spending a single action, which has the manipulate trait, to wipe off the ink from their face.

## [[Stylus Claws]]

**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
Your calligraphy wyrm has stylus-shaped claws that it can fill with its natural ink, using its claw as a pen without having to purchase ink.
