**Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The imp offers a non-fiend within 15 feet a bargain, granting a boon of good luck if the creature accepts. The boon lasts for 1 hour once accepted. If the creature dies while the boon is in place, its soul travels to [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell]], where it is bound for eternity and unable to be raised or resurrected except by [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] or similar magic. Once during the hour, the creature can roll an attack roll or saving throw twice and use the higher result.
