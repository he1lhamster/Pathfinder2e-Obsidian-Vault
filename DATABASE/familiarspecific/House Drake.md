The house drake breathes a 10-foot cone of silver mist. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. A creature that fails its save is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]] for 1 round. The house drake can't use Breath Weapon or Silver Infusion for 1d4 rounds.

Your house drake breathes on one of your weapons. Until the start of your next turn, that weapon counts as [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|silver]] instead of its normal material for any physical damage it deals. The house drake can't use Breath Weapon or Silver Infusion for 1d4 rounds.

Once per day, as long as your house drake took no actions on the previous round, you gain the following. 
**Ferocious Will** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (abjuration, arcane, mental) **Trigger** You succeed at a saving throw against a magical mental effect; **Effect** You send a blast of magical feedback at the effect's source, dealing 2d6 mental damage (basic Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher) to that creature. On a failed save, the creature is also [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round.
