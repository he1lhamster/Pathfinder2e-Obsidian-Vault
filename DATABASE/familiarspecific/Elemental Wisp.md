Wisps are tiny elementals that often act as familiars. They each usually have different personalities: air wisps are playful and capricious, earth wisps are timid but loyal, fire wisps are carefree and boisterous, metal wisps are serious and morose, water wisps are gentle and nurturing, and wood wisps are fierce and controlling.

30 feet. Your wisp vibrates at a frequency attuned to their element, resonating with and empowering all effects sharing that trait.
