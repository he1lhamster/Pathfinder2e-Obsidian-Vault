Wisps are tiny elementals that often act as familiars.

Your wisp gains a familiar ability depending on its element. Air wisps gain [[Flier]], earth wisps gain [[Burrower]], fire wisps gain [[Jet]], metal wisps gain [[Levitator]], water wisps gain [[Amphibious]], and wood wisps gain [[Climber]].

30 feet. Your wisp vibrates at a frequency attuned to their element, resonating with and empowering all effects sharing that trait. Creatures in the area gain a +1 status bonus to damage rolls for alchemical and magical effects with the same elemental trait as your wisp. If your wisp is a wood wisp, the status bonus also applies to damage rolls for effects with the plant trait.
