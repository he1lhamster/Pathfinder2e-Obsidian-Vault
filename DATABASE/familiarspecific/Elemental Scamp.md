The elementals called [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Mephit|scamps]] look humanoid in appearance, except for the elemental matter in their bodies and their batlike wings. An elemental scamp familiar is a bit smaller than other scamps but makes up for it by being more mischievous. Driven by ego, scamps often take on long names with many titles and insist on being addressed in full.
