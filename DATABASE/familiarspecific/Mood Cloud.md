**Required Number of Abilities** 3
**Granted Abilities** [[DATABASE/familiarability/Elemental|elemental (air only)]], [[DATABASE/familiarability/Flier|flier]]
This air elemental is little more than a tiny cloud with just enough internality to have emotions. Elemental scholars believe mood clouds to be related to [[DATABASE/monster/Despairing Pall|despairing palls]], though far less evolved.

**Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The cloud of sentiment changes the expression on its miniature face. It prepares to [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] you on a skill check for a skill matching its expression: [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] for an inscrutable expression, [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] for a friendly expression, or [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] for an angry expression. It gains a reaction this round, which it can use only to Aid you in this way. It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with the skill or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question.
