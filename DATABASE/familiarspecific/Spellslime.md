# Spellslime

<span class="item-trait">Ooze</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Required Number of Abilities** 4
**Granted Abilities** [[Climber]], [[Darkvision]], [[Tough]]
These friendly, colorful oozes congeal from the essences left over from casting spells. They are extremely loyal to their masters. You can select a spellslime familiar only if you can cast spells using spell slots.

## [[Magic Scent]]

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Your spellslime familiar gains an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet that enables it to smell magic of the same tradition as your own.

## [[Ooze Defense]]

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Your spellslime familiar is easy to hit, but it lacks weak points. It is immune to critical hits and precision damage, but its AC is only 10 + your level (instead of an AC equal to yours).

## [[Slime Rejuvenation]]

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Your spellslime familiar gains the [[Focused Rejuvenation]] ability, but it recovers 2 Hit Points per level when you [[Refocus]] instead of 1.
