# Crawling Hand

<span class="item-trait">Undead</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Required Number of Abilities** 5
**Granted Abilities** [[DATABASE/familiarability/Manual Dexterity|manual dexterity]], [[DATABASE/familiarability/Spell Delivery|spell delivery]], [[DATABASE/familiarability/Valet|valet]]
Crawling hands make grisly but striking familiars, popular among necromancers with an eye for aesthetics. They also tend to be convenient, due to many available spare parts. Crawling hands can be skeletal or fleshy, like a zombie.

The crawling hand assists an ally in the same space to attack a foe, crawling over the enemy and grabbing to distract them. Despite being a minion, it gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] an attack roll by an ally that shares the hand's space (it still has to prepare to help as normal for the Aid reaction). This attempt automatically succeeds. If the crawling hand has a similar ability, like [[DATABASE/familiarability/Partner in Crime|partner in crime]], it still gains only 1 reaction and can choose how to spend it.
