# Shadow Familiar

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Shadow</span>
**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
**Access** you're a [[Shadowcaster]]
**Required Number of Abilities** 7
**Granted Abilities** [[Darkvision]], [[Manual Dexterity]], [[Master's Form]], [[Resistance]], [[Shadow Step]]
Some spellcasters and ritualists don't just summon and bind a familiar, but instead transform their own shadow into a familiar. These casters can be identified by their lack of a shadow regardless of the level of light in the area and by the strange muted appearance of any article of clothing or jewelry they wear. Occasionally mistaken for [[Vampire]] or other undead by the cautious or superstitious, these spellcasters nonetheless find the trade worth it in exchange for the unique abilities their shadow familiar can possess.
 Shadow familiars are a type of specific familiar. While all shadowcasters have access to these familiars, there are other paths to learn the proper magic to obtain a shadow familiar.

The shadow familiar transforms its body into barely tangible shadow. It gains resistance to all damage (except force) equal to half your level but can't use any actions requiring a physical form. The familiar can also slip through gaps at least 2 inches wide, or 1 inch wide if it [[Squeeze]]. It can use this action again to return to its normal form.
 This action has the trait matching your tradition of magic, or occult if you aren't a spellcaster.

## [[Slink In Shadows]]

**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
The shadow familiar can [[Hide]] or end its [[Sneak]] in a creature's or object's shadow.

## [[Steal Shadow]] <span class="action-icon">1</span>

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Effect** The shadow familiar makes a melee attack with an attack roll modifier equal to your spell attack roll modifier. If the Strike is successful, the target is [[Enfeebled]] and its shadow disappears. After 24 hours, the enfeebled condition ends, and they regain their shadow once more. Any effect that reduces or removes the enfeebled condition restores their shadow as well.
