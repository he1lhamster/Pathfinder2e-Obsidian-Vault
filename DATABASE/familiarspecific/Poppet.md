<span class="item-trait">Construct</span>
**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
**Required Number of Abilities** 1
**Granted Abilities** 
Endlessly modifiable, poppet familiars made of wicker and wood are among the most basic construct familiars available to Pathfinder agents across the globe.

## [[Constructed]]

**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
Your poppet is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, [[Doomed]], [[Drained]], [[Fatigued]], healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, [[Paralyzed]], poison, [[Sickened]], and [[Unconscious]]. It can recover Hit Points only via the [[Repair]] action and other methods that fix items, not from any form of Hit Point healing. It's destroyed at 0 HP.

## [[Flammable]]

**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
Your poppet's components make it particularly vulnerable to fire. It gains weakness to fire equal to your level. You can spend an additional familiar ability, either permanently or on a per-day basis, to reinforce the poppet's construction, removing this weakness.
