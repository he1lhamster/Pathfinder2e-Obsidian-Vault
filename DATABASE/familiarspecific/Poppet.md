Your poppet is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]], healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], poison, [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]], and [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]]. It can recover Hit Points only via the [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repair]] action and other methods that fix items, not from any form of Hit Point healing. It's destroyed at 0 HP.

Your poppet's components make it particularly vulnerable to fire. It gains weakness to fire equal to your level. You can spend an additional familiar ability, either permanently or on a per-day basis, to reinforce the poppet's construction, removing this weakness.
