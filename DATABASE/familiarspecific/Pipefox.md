A pipefox is a tiny magical fox with a thin, limbless body that is about a foot long. Pipefoxes are secretive, shy, evasive, and they love to acquire knowledge, using innate divination magic to learn facts and languages over time. They can bond with a person sharing their scholarly pursuits after a long period of observation and careful social interactions.

Thanks to its innate tendency for divinations, your pipefox speaks and understands all languages you know (instead of just one) as well as one common language you don't know.
