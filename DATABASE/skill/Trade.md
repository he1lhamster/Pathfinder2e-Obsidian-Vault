# Trade (Economy)

**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
Trade measures a kingdom’s involvement in commerce of every kind, but especially in moving goods from one place to another and in the health of its market. You take a cumulative –1 item penalty on Trade checks for each settlement in your kingdom that has no Land Borders, unless it has at least one Water Border with a Bridge.

You contribute funds from your personal wealth for the good of the kingdom, including coinage, gems, jewelry, weapons and armor salvaged from enemies, magical or alchemical items, and so on. Your contribution generates economic activity in the form of RP that can be used during your current Kingdom turn or on the next Kingdom turn (your choice).
 You can use Capital Investment to repay funds from Tap Treasury (page 528). In this case, no roll is needed and you simply deduct the appropriate amount of funds from your personal wealth to pay back that which was borrowed. When you use Capital Investment to generate RP, the amount of gp required to make an investment is set by your kingdom's level. Investments below this amount cause your attempt at Capital Investment to suffer an automatic critical failure, while investments above this amount are lost. The investment required is equal to the value listed on Table 10–9: Party Treasure by Level in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook (page 509); use the value for your kingdom's level under the “Currency per Additional PC” as the required investment value. This is a basic check.
**Critical Success** Your kingdom reaps the benefits of your investment. Immediately roll 4 Resource Dice. Gain RP equal to the result.
**Success** Your investment helps the economy. Immediately roll 2 Resource Dice. Gain RP equal to the result.
**Failure** Your investment ends up being used to shore up shortfalls elsewhere. Gain 1d4 RP.
**Critical Failure** Your investment is embezzled, lost, or otherwise misappropriated. Choose one of the following: either roll 1 Resource Die and gain RP equal to the result and also increase your Crime by an equal amount, or gain 0 RP and increase Crime by 1.

## [[Manage Trade Agreements]]

You send agents out to attend to established trade agreements. Spend 2 RP per Trade Agreement you wish to manage. Then attempt a basic check. If you Managed Trade Agreements on the previous turn, increase this DC by 5.
**Critical Success** At the start of your next Kingdom turn, you gain 1 bonus Resource Die per trade agreement, and 1 Commodity of your choice per trade agreement (no more than half of these Commodities may be Luxuries).
**Success** As critical success, but you must choose between gaining Resource Dice or Commodities.
**Failure** You gain 1 RP per trade agreement at the start of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** You gain no benefit, as your traders and merchants met with bad luck on the road. You can't Manage Trade Agreements for 1 Kingdom turn.

## [[Purchase Commodities]]

You can spend RP to Purchase Commodities, but doing so is more expensive than gathering them or relying upon trade agreements. When you Purchase Commodities, select the Commodity you wish to purchase (Food, Lumber, Luxuries, Ore, or Stone). Expend 8 RP if you're purchasing Luxuries or 4 RP if you're purchasing any other Commodity. Then attempt a basic check.
**Critical Success** You immediately gain 4 Commodities of the chosen type and 2 Commodities of any other type (except Luxuries).
**Success** You gain 2 Commodities of the chosen type.
**Failure** You gain 1 Commodity of the chosen type.
**Critical Failure** You gain no Commodities.

Tax collectors travel through the lands to collect funds for the betterment of the kingdom. Attempt a basic check.
**Critical Success** Your tax collectors are wildly successful! For the remainder of the Kingdom turn, gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Economy-based checks.
**Success** Your tax collectors gather enough to grant you a +1 circumstance bonus to Economy-based checks for the remainder of the Kingdom turn. If you attempted to Collect Taxes during the previous turn, increase Unrest by 1.
**Failure** As success, but the people are unhappy about taxes—increase Unrest by 1 (or by 2 if you attempted to Collect Taxes the previous turn).
**Critical Failure** Your tax collectors encounter resistance from the citizens and their attempts to gather taxes are rebuffed. While the tax collectors still manage to gather enough taxes to support essential government needs, they have angered the kingdom's citizens and encouraged rebellious acts. Increase Unrest by 2, and choose one Ruin to increase by 1.
