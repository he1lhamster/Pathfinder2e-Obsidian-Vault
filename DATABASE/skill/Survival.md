## [[Sense Direction]]

<span class="item-trait">Exploration</span><span class="item-trait">Secret</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]]

---
Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the geography or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay oriented in the wild. Typically, you attempt a Survival check only once per day, but some environments or changes might necessitate rolling more often. The GM determines the DC and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so). More unusual locales or those you’re unfamiliar with might require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense Direction. Without a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to checks to Sense Direction.
**Critical Success** You get an excellent sense of where you are. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you know them exactly.
**Success** You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you have a sense of those directions.

### Sample Sense Direction Tasks

**Untrained** determine a cardinal direction using the sun
**Trained** find an overgrown path in a forest
**Expert** navigate a hedge maze
**Master** navigate a byzantine labyrinth or relatively featureless desert
**Legendary** navigate an ever-changing dream realm

# Survival Trained Actions

## [[Cover Tracks]]

<span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span><span class="item-trait">Exploration</span><span class="item-trait">Move</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]]

---
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel speed. You don’t need to attempt a Survival check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.
 In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn’t have the exploration trait.

## [[Track]]

<span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span><span class="item-trait">Exploration</span><span class="item-trait">Move</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]]

---
You follow tracks, moving at up to half your travel speed. After a successful check to Track, you can continue following the tracks at half your Speed without attempting additional checks for up to 1 hour. In some cases, you might Track in an encounter. In this case, Track is a single action and doesn’t have the exploration trait, but you might need to roll more often because you’re in a tense situation. The GM determines how often you must attempt this check.
 You attempt your Survival check when you start Tracking, once every hour you continue tracking, and any time something significant changes in the trail. The GM determines the DCs for such checks, depending on the freshness of the trail, the weather, and the type of ground.
**Success** You find the trail or continue to follow the one you’re already following.
**Failure** You lose the trail but can try again after a 1-hour delay.
**Critical Failure** You lose the trail and can’t try again for 24 hours.

### Sample Track Tasks

**Untrained** the path of a large army following a road
**Trained** relatively fresh tracks of a rampaging bear through the plains
**Expert** a nimble panther's tracks through a jungle, tracks obscured by rainfall
**Master** tracks obscured by winter snow, tracks of a mouse or smaller creature, tracks left on surfaces that can't hold prints like bare rock
**Legendary** old tracks through a windy desert’s sands, tracks after a major blizzard or hurricane
