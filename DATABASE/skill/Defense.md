# Defense (Stability)

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
Defense measures the kingdom’s ability to police and protect itself and its citizens from bandits, monsters, criminals, outside incursions, and pestilence or plague, but not natural disasters (see Wilderness on page 530). It includes both physical fortifications and barriers as well as dedicated individuals guarding the land.

Your command your engineers to construct a protected encampment, such as a fort or barbican, to serve as a defensive post in the hex. Spend RP as determined by the hex's most inhospitable terrain (see the Building on Rough Terrain sidebar on page 519). Then attempt a basic check. A fortified hex grants an additional bonus in warfare (see Appendix 3), but also gives traveling PCs a place to rest that prevents wandering monsters from interrupting their rest.
**Critical Success** You find a defensible position for your fortification and finish construction efficiently. Gain a refund of half the RP you spent to build in the hex, then reduce Unrest by 1.
**Success** You establish your fortification in the hex. Reduce Unrest by 1.
**Failure** You fail to fortify the hex.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt ends in disaster. Not only do you fail to build a structure, but you lose several workers to an accident, banditry, a vicious monster, or some other unforeseen occurrence. Gain 1 Unrest.
