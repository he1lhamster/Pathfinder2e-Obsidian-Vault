With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and linguistic traits. 
Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.
**Success** You become [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]] away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] or the Sneak action of the [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] skill. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against that attack, and you then become [[DATABASE/condition/Observed|observed]]. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.
**Failure** You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.

You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a [[DATABASE/equipment/Disguise Kit|disguise kit]], but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.
 In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your deception only if they use the [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] action to attempt Perception checks against your [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature’s Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception check even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.
**Success** You trick the creature into thinking you’re the person you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check if your behavior changes.
**Failure** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be.
**Critical Failure** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without a disguise.

You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single Deception check and compare it against the Perception DC of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give them a circumstance bonus based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it’s impossible to get anyone to believe them.
 At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might attempt a Perception check later to Sense Motive against your Deception DC to realize it’s a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.
**Success** The target believes your lie.
**Failure** The target doesn’t believe your lie and gains a +4 circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.

With a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unprepared for your real attack. Attempt a Deception check against that opponent’s Perception DC.
**Critical Success** You throw your enemy’s defenses against you entirely off. The target is flat-footed against melee attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your next turn.
**Success** Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is flat-footed against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.
**Critical Failure** Your feint backfires. You are flat-footed against melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end of your next turn.
