There are five different categories of Commodities: Food, Lumber, Luxuries, Ore, and Stone. When you Trade Commodities, select one Commodity that your kingdom currently stockpiles and reduce that Commodity's stockpile by up to 4. Then attempt a basic check. If you trade with a group that you've established diplomatic relations with, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check.
**Critical Success** At the beginning of the next Kingdom turn, you gain 2 bonus Resource Dice per point of stockpile expended from your Commodity now.
