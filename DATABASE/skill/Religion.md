# Religion (Wis)

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
The secrets of deities, dogma, faith, and the realms of divine creatures both sublime and sinister are open to you. You also understand how magic works, though your training imparts a religious slant to that knowledge. Even if you’re untrained in Religion, you can use it to Recall Knowledge.

* **[[Recall Knowledge]]** about divine agents, the finer points of theology, obscure myths regarding a faith, and creatures of religious significance (like celestials, fiends, and undead), the Outer Sphere, and the Positive and Negative Energy Planes.

## Religion Trained Actions

* **[[Decipher Writing]]** of a religious nature, including allegories, homilies, and proverbs.
* **[[Identify Magic]]**, particularly divine magic.
* **[[Learn a Spell]]** from the divine tradition.
* **[[Tap Ley Line]]** tapping a divine ley line
