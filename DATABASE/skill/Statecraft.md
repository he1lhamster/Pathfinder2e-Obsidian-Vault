You tap into the cash reserves of your kingdom for the PCs' personal use or to provide emergency funding for an event. This is a basic check, but after you succeed or critically succeed at this activity, all future attempts to Tap Treasury have their results worsened two degrees. This penalty persists until funds equal to those taken from the treasury are repaid via Capital Investment (page 529).
**Critical Success** You withdraw funds equal to the Currency per Additional PC column on Table 10–9: Party Treasure By Level on page 509 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook (using your kingdom's level to set the amount), or you successfully fund the unexpected event that required you to Tap your Treasury.
**Success** As critical success, but you overdraw your treasury in the attempt. You take a –1 circumstance penalty to all Economy-based checks until the end of your next Kingdom turn.
**Failure** You fail to secure the funds you need, and rumors about the kingdom's potential shortfall of cash cause you to take a –1 circumstance penalty to all Loyalty and Economy-based checks until the end of your next Kingdom turn.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the rumors spiral out of control. Increase Unrest by 1 and add 1 to a Ruin of your choice.

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Requirements** You have diplomatic relations with the group you are requesting aid from.

---
When disaster strikes, you send out a call for help to another nation with whom you have diplomatic relations. The DC of this check is equal to the other group's Negotiation DC +2 (see the sidebar on page 519).
**Critical Success** Your ally's aid grants a +4 circumstance bonus to any one Kingdom skill check attempted during the remainder of this Kingdom turn. You can choose to apply this bonus to any Kingdom skill check after the die is rolled, but must do so before the result is known. In addition, immediately roll 2 Resource Dice and gain RP equal to the result; this RP does not accrue into XP at the end of the turn if you don't spend it.
**Success** As success, but choose the benefit given by the aid: either roll 1 Resource Die and gain RP equal to the result or gain a +2 circumstance bonus to a check.
**Failure** Your ally marshals its resources but cannot get aid to you in time to deal with your current situation. At the start of your next Kingdom turn, gain 1d4 RP.
**Critical Failure** Your ally is tangled up in its own problems and is unable to assist you, is insulted by your request for aid, or might even have an interest in seeing your kingdom struggle against one of your ongoing events. Whatever the case, your pleas for aid make your kingdom look desperate. You gain no aid, but you do increase Unrest by 1d4.

You send emissaries to another group to foster positive relations and communication. The DC of this check is the group's Negotiation DC (see the sidebar on page 519). Attempts to Send a Diplomatic Envoy to a nation with which your kingdom is at war take a –4 circumstance penalty to the check and have the result worsened one degree. At the GM's option, some wars might be so heated that this activity has no chance of success.
**Critical Success** Your envoys are received quite warmly and make a good first impression. You establish diplomatic relations with the group (see page 534 for more information) and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all checks made with that group until the next Kingdom turn.
**Success** You establish diplomatic relations.
**Failure** Your envoys are received, but the target organization isn't ready to engage in diplomatic relations. If you attempt to Send a Diplomatic Envoy to the group next Kingdom turn, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to that check.
**Critical Failure** Disaster! Your envoy fails to reach their destination, is turned back at the border, or is taken prisoner or executed, at the GM's discretion. The repercussions on your kingdom's morale and reputation are significant. Choose one of the following results: gain 1d4 Unrest, add 1 to a Ruin of your choice, or immediately roll 2 Resource Dice and spend RP equal to the result. In any event, you cannot attempt to Send a Diplomatic Envoy to this same target for the next 3 Kingdom turns.The first time your kingdom succeeds at establishing diplomatic relations in the campaign, gain 60 kingdom XP as a milestone award (page 538).
