# Engineering Untrained Actions

## [[Build Roads]]

<span class="item-trait">Downtime</span><span class="item-trait">Region</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Requirements** The hex in which you seek to build roads must be claimed by your kingdom.

---
You order your kingdom's engineers to construct a network of robust roads through the hex. Travel along roads uses a terrain type one step better than the surrounding terrain; for example, roads through forest hexes—normally difficult terrain—allow travel as if it were open terrain.
 Spend RP as determined by the hex's most inhospitable terrain (see Building on Rough Terrain on page 519; if the hex includes any rivers that cross the hex from one hex side to any other, you must spend double the normal RP cost to also build bridges; this adds the Bridge structure to that hex). Then attempt a basic check. Work with the GM to determine where your roads appear on the map.
**Critical Success** You build roads into the target hex and one adjacent claimed hex that doesn't yet have roads and whose terrain features are at least as hospitable as those of the target hex. If no adjacent hex is appropriate, treat this result as a Success instead.
**Success** You build roads in the hex.
**Failure** You fail to build roads in the hex.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt to build roads ends in disaster. Not only do you fail to build roads, but you lose several workers to an accident, banditry, a vicious monster, or some other unforeseen occurrence. Gain 1 Unrest.

## [[Demolish]]

---
Choose a single occupied lot in one of your settlements and attempt a basic check to reduce it to Rubble and then clear the Rubble away to make ready for a new structure. For multiple-lot structures, you'll need to perform multiple Demolish activities (or critically succeed at the activity) to fully clear all of the lots. As soon as you begin Demolishing a multiple-lot structure, all of the lots occupied by that structure no longer function.
**Critical Success** Choose one of the following effects: you demolish an entire multiple-lot structure all at once and clear all of the lots it occupied, or you recover 1d6 Commodities (chosen from lumber, stone, and ore) from the Rubble of a single-lot demolition.
**Success** You demolish the lot successfully.
**Failure** You fail to demolish the lot. It remains in Rubble and cannot be used for further construction until you successfully Demolish it.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but accidents during the demolition cost you the lives of some of your workers. Gain 1 Unrest.

## [[Establish Work Site]]

<span class="item-trait">Downtime</span><span class="item-trait">Region</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]

---
Your hire a crew of workers to travel to a hex that contains Lumber, Ore, or Stone to be harvested. Spend RP as determined by the hex's most inhospitable terrain (see the Building on Rough Terrain sidebar on page 519). Then attempt a basic check. Lumber camps can be established in any hex that contains a significant amount of forest terrain. Mines and quarries can be established in any hex that contains a significant amount of hill or mountain terrain.
**Critical Success** You establish a Work Site in the hex and proceed to discover an unexpectedly rich supply of high quality Commodities. All Commodity yields granted by this site are doubled until the end of the next Kingdom turn.
**Success** You establish a Work Site in the hex.
**Failure** You fail to establish a Work Site in the hex.
**Critical Failure** Not only do you fail to establish a Work Site, but you lose several workers to an accident, banditry, a vicious monster, or some other unforeseen occurrence. Gain 1 Unrest.

# Engineering Trained Actions

## [[Irrigation]]

<span class="item-trait">Downtime</span><span class="item-trait">Region</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Requirements** You control a hex adjacent to a river or lake that itself does not contain a river or lake.

---
You send excavators to build waterways, canals, or drainage systems to convey water from areas that have natural access to a river or lake. Spend RP as determined by the hex's most inhospitable terrain feature (see the Building on Rough Terrain sidebar on page 519). Then attempt a basic check.
**Critical Success** The hex gains a river or lake terrain feature (or you change the effects of a previous critical failure at Irrigation in this hex into a failure); work with your GM to determine where these features appear in the hex. In addition, your workers were efficient and quick, and you regain half the RP you spent building the waterways.
**Success** As success, but without regaining any RP.
**Failure** You fail to build workable systems or to restore a previous critical failure, and the hex does not gain the river or lake terrain feature.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but your attempts at Irrigation are so completely useless that they become breeding grounds for disease. Gain 1 Unrest. From this point onward, at the start of your Kingdom turn's Event phase, attempt a DC 4 flat check. This flat check's DC increases by 1 for each hex in your kingdom that contains a critically failed attempt at Irrigation. If you fail this flat check, your kingdom suffers a Plague event in addition to any other event it might have. You can attempt this activity again in a later Kingdom turn to undo a critically failed Irrigation attempt.
