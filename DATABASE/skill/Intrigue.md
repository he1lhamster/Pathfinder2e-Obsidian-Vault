You send spies out to gather intelligence on a neighboring nation, a cult or thieves' guild within your borders, an unclaimed Freehold, or even an unexplored adventure site. Alternately, you can simply send your spies out to investigate the current health of your kingdom. Attempt a basic check.
**Critical Success** You learn something valuable or helpful. If you were infiltrating a specific target, the GM decides what is learned, but the information is exact and precise. For example, if you were infiltrating an unexplored ruin, you might learn that the site is infested with web lurkers and spider swarms. If you were investigating your kingdom's health, your spies reveal easy methods to address citizen dissatisfaction, allowing you to choose one of the following: reduce Unrest by 1d4 or reduce a Ruin of your choice by 1.
**Success** You learn something helpful about the target, but the information is vague and imprecise. For example, if you were infiltrating the same ruin mentioned in the critical success above, you might learn that some sort of aberration uses the ruins as its lair. If you were investigating your kingdom's health, your spies learn enough that you can take action. Reduce your kingdom's Unrest by 1.
**Failure** Your spies fail to learn anything of import, but they are not themselves compromised.
**Critical Failure** You never hear from your spies again, but someone certainly does! You take a –2 circumstance penalty on all kingdom checks until the end of the next Kingdom turn as counter-infiltration from an unknown enemy tampers with your kingdom's inner workings.

You know there are criminals in your kingdom, and they know you know. You encourage them to send kickbacks in the form of resources and Commodities to the government, but the common citizens will be more than upset if they find out! This starts as a basic check against your Control DC, but every subsequent Kingdom turn you pursue Clandestine Business, the DC increases by 2. Every Kingdom turn that passes without Clandestine Business reduces the DC by 1 (until you reach your Control DC).
**Critical Success** Immediately roll 2 Resource Dice. Gain RP equal to the result. In addition, you gain 1d4 Luxury Commodities. The public is none the wiser.
**Success** Either immediately roll 2 Resource Dice and gain RP equal to the result, or gain 1d4 Luxury Commodities. Regardless of your choice, rumors spread about where the government is getting these “gifts.” Increase Unrest by 1.
**Failure** Immediately roll 1 Resource Die and gain RP equal to the result. Rumors are backed up with eyewitness accounts. Increase Unrest by 1 and Corruption by 1.
**Critical Failure** You gain nothing from the Clandestine Business but angry citizens. Increase Unrest by 1d6, Corruption by 2, and one other Ruin of your choice by 1.
