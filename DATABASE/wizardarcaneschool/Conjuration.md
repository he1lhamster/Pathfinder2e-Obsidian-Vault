# Conjuration

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
As a conjurer, you summon creatures and objects from places beyond, and use magic to transport to distant locales. You understand that the true key to victory is strength in numbers. You add one 1st-level conjuration spell (such as [[Summon Animal]]) to your spellbook. You learn the [[Augment Summoning]] school spell.
