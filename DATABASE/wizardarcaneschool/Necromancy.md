# Necromancy

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
As a necromancer, you call upon the powers of life and death. While your school is often vilified for its association with raising the undead, you understand that control over life also means control over healing. You add one 1st-level necromancy spell (such as [[DATABASE/spell/Grim Tendrils|grim tendrils]]) to your spellbook. You learn the [[DATABASE/spell/Call of the Grave|call of the grave]] school spell.
