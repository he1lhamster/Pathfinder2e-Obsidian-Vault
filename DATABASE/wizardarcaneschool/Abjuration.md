# Abjuration

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
As an abjurer, you master the art of protection, strengthening defenses, preventing attacks, and even turning magic against itself. You understand that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. You add one 1st-level abjuration spell (such as [[Feather Fall]]) to your spellbook. You learn the [[Protective Ward]] school spell.
