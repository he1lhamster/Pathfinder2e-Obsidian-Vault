# Abjuration

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
As an abjurer, you master the art of protection, strengthening defenses, preventing attacks, and even turning magic against itself. You understand that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. You add one 1st-level abjuration spell (such as [[DATABASE/spell/Feather Fall|feather fall]]) to your spellbook. You learn the [[DATABASE/spell/Protective Ward|protective ward]] school spell.
