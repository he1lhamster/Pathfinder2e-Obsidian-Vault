# Evocation

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
As an evoker, you revel in the raw power of magic, using it to create and destroy with ease. You can call forth elements, forces, and energy to devastate your foes or to assist you in other ways. You understand that the most direct approach is the most elegant. You add one 1st-level evocation spell (such as [[Shocking Grasp]]) to your spellbook. You learn the [[Force Bolt]] school spell.
