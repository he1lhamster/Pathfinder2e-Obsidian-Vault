# Illusion

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
As an illusionist, you use magic to create images, figments, and phantasms to baffle your enemies. You understand that perception is reality. You add one 1st-level illusion spell (such as [[Illusory Object]]) to your spellbook. You learn the [[Warped Terrain]] school spell.
