As an illusionist, you use magic to create images, figments, and phantasms to baffle your enemies. You understand that perception is reality. You add one 1st-level illusion spell (such as [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Object|illusory object]]) to your spellbook. You learn the [[DATABASE/spell/Warped Terrain|warped terrain]] school spell.
