As a diviner, you master remote viewing and prescience, learning information that can transform investigations, research, and battle strategies. You understand that knowledge is power. You add one 1st-level divination spell (such as [[True Strike]]) to your spellbook. You learn the [[Diviner's Sight]] school spell.
