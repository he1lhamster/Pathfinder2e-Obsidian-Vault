# Transmutation

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
As a transmuter, you alter the physical properties of things, transforming creatures, objects, the natural world, and even yourself at your whim. You understand that change is inevitable. You add one 1st-level transmutation spell (such as [[Magic Weapon]]) to your spellbook. You learn the [[Physical Boost]] school spell.
