Cut off since prehistory, the Plane of Metal recently returned to the planar cosmology. Resuming its ancient form, it wedges between the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] and [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], vast in scope but still expanding. Metal of every kind, decaying cityscapes, and intense magnetic fields comprise the plane's chaotic structure. Creatures reflect the jumble of forces that make their home; many have fluid forms of liquid metal or inhabit rust clouds. The plane's genies, zuhras, put on bold performances keyed into the plane's dissonance.
 The elemental lords of metal embody their home's slow disintegration. After an invasion by forces from the Plane of Earth, before their plane was sealed off, the lords were dispirited and offered no clear vision for what the Plane of Metal could be in the absence of the Inner Sphere's other planes. [[DATABASE/deity/Laudinmio|Laudinmio]], the Sovereign of Alchemy, remains in slumber, and [[DATABASE/deity/Ferrumnestra|Ferrumnestra]], the Lady of Rust, treads under the weight of deep despair.
