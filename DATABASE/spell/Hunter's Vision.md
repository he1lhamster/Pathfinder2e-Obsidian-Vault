Your target glows with a magical aura visible only to you and those who follow your lead. Your target is visible to you and others sharing your [[DATABASE/action/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] benefits even if it wouldn't normally be due to lighting or the [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] conditions, though cover from opaque objects still blocks your sight. You ignore the flat check against the target due to the concealed condition, and the target isn't automatically [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from you due to darkness or being invisible.
