You cause the surface to heave. The area becomes difficult terrain and any tracks in the area are destroyed by the churning ground. Creatures standing in the area take a –1 status penalty to [[Acrobatics]] checks to [[Balance]] and [[Tumble Through]] and Athletics checks to [[High Jump]] and [[Long Jump]]. The first time each round you Sustain the Spell, you can move the churning area up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures [[Immobilized]] by the spell are carried along with the shifting sand in the same direction, if possible; this movement is forced movement. Creatures that enter or begin their turn standing in the shifting sand must attempt a Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and ignores the area’s difficult terrain and penalty to skill checks until the end of its turn.
**Success** The creature ignores the area’s penalty to skill checks until the end of its turn.
**Failure** The creature is affected normally by the spell this turn.
**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Immobilized]] within the spell’s area until it [[Escape]]. If the creature was already immobilized by shifting sands, it also falls [[Prone]].
