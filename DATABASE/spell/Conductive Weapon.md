You channel powerful electric current through the metal of a weapon, zapping anyone the item hits. The target becomes a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Shock|shock]]_ weapon. If any target of an attack with the weapon is wearing metal armor or is primarily made of metal, the electricity damage die from the _shock_ rune is 1d12.
