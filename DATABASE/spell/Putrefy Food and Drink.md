You cause otherwise edible food to rot and spoil instantly, and water and other liquids to become brackish and undrinkable. [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy Water|Holy water]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Unholy Water|unholy water]], and similar food and drink of significance are spoiled by this spell, unless they are associated with a deity of decay or putrefaction, but it has no effect on creatures of any type, potions, or alchemical elixirs.
