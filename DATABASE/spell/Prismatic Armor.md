You wrap the target in armor made of multicolored light. It functions as [[DATABASE/spell/Chromatic Armor|chromatic armor]] that is all colors (granting resistance 5 to acid, electricity, fire, force, mental, poison, and sonic). An attacker that critically fails on its saving throw against the spell is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] rather than [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]].
