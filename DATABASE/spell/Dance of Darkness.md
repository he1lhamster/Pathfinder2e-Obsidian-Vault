You dance, Striding up to half your Speed. At either the start or end of your Stride, you create an area of magical darkness in a 10-foot burst centered on your location. This area is filled with magical darkness that works the same way as that created by a [[Darkness]] spell of the same level. When you create the darkness, attempt a [[Performance]] check to dance, with a standard DC for your level, to determine the duration of the darkness.
**Critical Success** 1 minute
**Success** 2 rounds
