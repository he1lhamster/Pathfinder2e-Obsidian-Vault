You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage. Each time it takes persistent force damage from _spellwrack_, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful Arcana check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the persistent damage; the curse and the persistent damage end after 1 minute.
**Failure** As success, but the curse and persistent damage do not end on their own.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12.
