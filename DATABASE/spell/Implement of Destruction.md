You solemnly declare that the target weapon will bring death to a foe, implanting an irrational fear of the weapon into the target enemy. This link echoes at the forefront of the enemy's mind, forming a looming sense of omnipresent dread. The effect is based on the target enemy's Will save.
**Critical Success** The target enemy is unaffected.
**Success** The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 mental damage the first time it hits the target enemy before the end of the spell's duration.
**Failure** The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent mental damage]] to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]] for as long as it takes this persistent mental damage.
**Critical Failure** The target weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is doomed 1.

**Heightened (+2)** Increase the mental damage by 1d6 on a success, and increase the persistent mental damage by 1d6 on a failure or by 2d6 on a critical failure.
