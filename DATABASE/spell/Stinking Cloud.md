You create a cloud of putrid mist in the area. The cloud functions as [[DATABASE/spell/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]] except it sickens creatures that end their turns within the cloud. (The concealed condition is not a poison effect.)
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is sickened 1.
**Failure** The creature is sickened 1 and slowed 1 while in the cloud.
**Critical Failure** The creature is sickened 2 and slowed 1 until it leaves the cloud.
