You take the form of a cloud of minuscule ash particles. You gain [[Fast Healing]] 3, resistance 10 to piercing and slashing damage, and immunity to bleed, falling damage, and precision damage. You can't move through solid objects, but you can stream through tiny gaps as if they were difficult terrain. Any ability with the air trait that involves blowing or shifting wind (such as [[Gust of Wind]]) deals you 1d6 bludgeoning damage per level of the spell each round you are in its area, in addition to its normal effects.

**Heightened (9th)** The resistance increases to 15.
