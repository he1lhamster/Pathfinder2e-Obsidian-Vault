You call upon an endless barrage of flames, producing miniature fireballs in your hands to hurl at foes. You cast [[Produce Flame]] as part of casting _flaming fusillade_. For the duration of _flaming fusillade_, _produce flame's_ casting time is reduced from 2 actions to 1.

**Heightened (9th)** For the duration, you also gain a status bonus to the damage dealt by _produce flame_ equal to _flaming fusillade's_ spell level.
