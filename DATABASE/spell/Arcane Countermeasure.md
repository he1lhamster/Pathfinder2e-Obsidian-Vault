You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend against. You reduce the spell's level by 1, and targets of the spell gain a +2 status bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it.
 You can't reduce the spell's level below its minimum. For example, a 5th-level [[Cone of Cold]] would remain 5th-level, but a 5th-level [[Fireball]] would become 4th-level. Targets still gain all the other benefits, even if you don't reduce the spell's level.
