You let loose a projectile that flies true and leaves the blazing trail of a meteor behind it. Make a ranged Strike, ignoring the target's [[Concealed]] and reducing the target's cover by one degree for this Strike only (greater to standard, standard to lesser, and lesser to none). If the Strike hits, the meteor trail hangs in the air. This gives the benefits of concealment negation and cover reduction to any attacks made against the creature (by anyone) until the start of your next turn.
