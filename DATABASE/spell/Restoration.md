Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent a creature from functioning at its best. When you cast _restoration_, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one _restoration_ spell each day, and it can't benefit from _restoration_ more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.

* **Lessen a Toxin** Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.
* **Reduce a Condition** Reduce the value of the target's clumsy, enfeebled, or stupefied condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.

**Heightened (4th)** Add drained to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's doomed value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent doomed condition.
**Heightened (6th)** As the 4th-level _restoration_, but you can reduce a permanent doomed condition if you add a spellcasting action and a material component while Casting the Spell, during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.
