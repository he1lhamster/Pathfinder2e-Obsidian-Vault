Reinforcing veins of ore run through the target's arm, letting it ward off blows with its bare skin. It can use the [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]] action to instead raise its arm, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. It can [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] with its Raised arm as well; when it does, the target reduces the damage as if it had a shield with Hardness 4 and 15 Hit Points. This shield doesn't have a Broken Threshold, and the spell ends if the shield's Hit Points are expended.
 This spell doesn't modify the target's unarmed attacks and can't be used to make a [[DATABASE/weapon/Shield Bash|shield bash]] Strike. Casting or coming under the effects of this spell also counts as using a metallic item with regards to anathema.
