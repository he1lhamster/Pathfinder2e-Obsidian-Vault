You transform one object into an edible substance that any living creature can chew, swallow, and safely digest. This _allfood_ always has a bland taste and slightly gooey consistency, regardless of its original nature. One bulk of _allfood_ provides enough sustenance to feed one Medium creature for a day.
 After 1 day, if no one has eaten the _allfood_, it reverts to its original form. Most Small creatures eat one-quarter as much as a Medium creature and most Tiny creatures eat one-sixteenth as much, while most Large creatures eat 10 times as much, Huge creatures need 100 times as much, and so on.
