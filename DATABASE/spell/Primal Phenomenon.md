You request a direct intercession from the natural world. Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. A _primal phenomenon_ spell can do any of the following things.

* Duplicate any spell from the primal list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
* Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.
* Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. 
* Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] spell.

At the GM's discretion, you can try to use _primal phenomenon_ to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.
