Your touch calls forth a churning mass of icy water that clings to your target, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 1d4 cold damage. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage and a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.
**Failure** The target takes full damage and a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double damage.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning and cold damage each increase by 1d4.
