You fire a javelin of electricity that leaves a charged field around its target. Make a spell attack roll. The javelin deals 1d6 electricity damage and 1 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent electricity damage]].
**Critical Success** The javelin deals double damage, both initial and persistent.
**Success** The javelin deals full damage. 
As long as the target is taking persistent damage from this spell, creatures gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls with metal weapons or electricity effects against the target, and the target takes a –1 status penalty to saves against electricity effects.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by 1d6, and the persistent damage increases by 1.
