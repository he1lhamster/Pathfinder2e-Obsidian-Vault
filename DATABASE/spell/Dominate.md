You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] as it fights off your commands.
**Failure** You control the target. It gains the [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]] condition, but it can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.
**Critical Failure** As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.

**Heightened (10th)** The duration is unlimited.
