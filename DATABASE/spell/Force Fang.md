You briefly turn your attack into pure force to bypass your opponent's defenses. Choose a target within your reach, or within the reach of a melee weapon you're wielding. If you can use [[DATABASE/action/Spellstrike|Spellstrike]] with a ranged weapon (with the [[DATABASE/magushybridstudy/Starlit Span|starlit span]] hybrid study, for example), you can target a creature in the first range increment of your ranged weapon. For an instant, you transform your weapon or unarmed attack into a spike of pure force, replacing all its normal statistics and abilities. The _force fang_ automatically deals 1d4+1 force damage to the target.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d4+1.
