You channel the might of dragons into your voice, letting out a roar that engenders respect in dragonkind but that instills fear in most other creatures. The impressive roar grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks for 10 minutes against dragons that were in the area at the time of casting. All enemies within the area other than dragons must attempt a Will save; to these enemies, _roar of the wyrm_ is a fear effect.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]].
**Failure** The creature is frightened 2.
**Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 3 and [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] for 1 round.
 _Roar of the wyrm_ affects non-dragon creatures with deep ties to dragonkind (such as a barbarian with the [[DATABASE/barbarianinstinct/Dragon Instinct|draconic instinct]], a sorcerer with the [[DATABASE/sorcererbloodline/Draconic|draconic bloodline]], or a member of a culture that reveres dragons) as if they had the dragon trait. The GM decides if a creature is aligned enough with dragonkind to be affected in this way.
