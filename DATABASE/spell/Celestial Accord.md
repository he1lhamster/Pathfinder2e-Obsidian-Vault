You intervene in a heated disagreement between two creatures, encouraging them to put aside their differences and find some common ground. The emotional heat of the prior moment becomes only a memory. Each target must make a Will save. A creature currently engaged in combat can't get a result worse than success, and a target that is subject to hostility from any other creature ceases to be affected by _celestial accord_.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is filled with doubt about its own intentions and feels an urge to cooperate with the other. It has a –2 status penalty to attack rolls against the other target for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature can't make hostile actions against the other target and its attitude toward the other target improves to indifferent for the spell's duration.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature's attitude toward the other target improves to [[DATABASE/condition/Friendly|friendly]] for the duration and is [[DATABASE/condition/Indifferent|indifferent]] thereafter (until something happens to change that attitude normally).
