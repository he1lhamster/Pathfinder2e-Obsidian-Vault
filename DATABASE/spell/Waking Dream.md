You cloud the target's mind with vivid, dreamlike imagery, so they have difficulty distinguishing real threats from imagined ones.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is distracted by the visions and treats all other creatures as [[Concealed]] for 1 round, and you can't Sustain the Spell to increase the duration.
**Failure** The target is [[Confused]]. In addition to the creatures present, the target might also attack wildly at thin air, attempting to fend off the dreams. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the confusion. Even if the confused effect ends early, the target treats all other creatures as concealed for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target gets no save to end the effect early.
