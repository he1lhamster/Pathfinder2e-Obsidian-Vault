Devil horns grow from your skull, and your skin takes on features of the devil responsible for your diabolic bloodline. You gain resistance 5 to evil, fire, and poison, and resistance 1 to physical damage (except silver). You can take good damage, even if you aren't evil, and you gain weakness 5 to good damage.
