You manipulate the earth beneath your feet to throw your enemies off balance, leaving chunks of rock and rubble behind. Creatures within range take 2d6 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex save; on a failed save, they also fall [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. The affected area becomes difficult terrain, but you can move through the difficult terrain normally.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
