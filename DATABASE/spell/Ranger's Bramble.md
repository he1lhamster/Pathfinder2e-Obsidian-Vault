You cause plants in the area to entangle your foes, with the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Entangle|entangle]]. A creature that critically fails the save takes 2d4 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] in addition to being [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]]. Escaping your bramble doesn't end the bleed damage.

**Heightened (+1)** The bleed damage on a critical failure increases by 1d4.
