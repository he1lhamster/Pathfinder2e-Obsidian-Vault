Your voice projects like cracking thunder as you summon a localized storm, creating a fearsome surge of lightning and wind that deals 6d6 electricity damage. Each creature must attempt a Reflex saving throw.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked prone, and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].

---
**Heightened (7th)** The damage increases to 8d6, and targets who critically fail are stunned 2.
**Heightened (9th)** The damage increases to 10d6, and targets who critically fail are stunned 3.
