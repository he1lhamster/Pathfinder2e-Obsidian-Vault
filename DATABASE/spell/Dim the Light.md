You magnify the darkness from the triggering effect, causing the ambient light level to flicker briefly so you can slip from sight. You can immediately attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]], and you can become [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to a creature even if you don't have cover and aren't otherwise [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] from that creature. You cease being hidden at the end of your turn unless you move into cover or become concealed before then.
