You magnify the darkness from the triggering effect, causing the ambient light level to flicker briefly so you can slip from sight. You can immediately attempt a [[Stealth]] check to [[Hide]], and you can become [[Hidden]] to a creature even if you don't have cover and aren't otherwise [[Concealed]] from that creature. You cease being hidden at the end of your turn unless you move into cover or become concealed before then.
