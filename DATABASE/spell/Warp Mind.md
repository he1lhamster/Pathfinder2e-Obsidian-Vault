---
You scramble a creature's mental faculties and sensory input. The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. _Warp mind_'s effects happen instantly, so [[Dispel Magic]] and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, [[Alter Reality]], [[Miracle]], [[Primal Phenomenon]], [[Restoration]], or [[Wish]] can still counteract the effects.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target spends the first action on its next turn with the confused condition.
**Failure** The target is confused for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The target is confused permanently.
