Your body sprouts a coat of brambly thorns that harm those that strike you and thrive on life magic. Adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that hit you with unarmed attacks, take 1 piercing damage each time they do. Anytime you cast a positive spell, the damage from your thorns increases to 1d6 until the start of your next turn.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1, or 1d6 after you cast a positive spell.
