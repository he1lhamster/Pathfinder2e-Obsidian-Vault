You establish a zone of magical feedback that makes it impossible to succeed at rituals of this spell's level or lower in the area. _Ritual obstruction_ ignores all cover, including walls and ceilings, to the extent of its area. Anyone attempting to cast a ritual within the area knows, when they begin to cast the ritual, the area is cursed to impede rituals. Any ritual cast in the area can't have a final result better than failure.
