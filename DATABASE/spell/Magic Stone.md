You pour positive energy into ordinary stones, granting them temporary magical properties. You can target 1 non-magical stone or sling bullet for every action you use Casting this Spell. The stones must be unattended or carried by you or a willing ally. The stones become _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|disrupting]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Sling Bullets|sling bullets]]_. Each stone can be used only once, after which it crumbles to dust.
