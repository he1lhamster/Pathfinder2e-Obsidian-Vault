You make an attack filled with a medusa's petrifying power. Make an unarmed Strike with the following additional effects.
**Critical Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 2]] and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from medusa's wrath, it is [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]] permanently. The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.
**Success** As critical success, but the target is initially slowed 1.
