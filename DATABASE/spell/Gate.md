You tear open a rift to another plane, creating a portal that creatures can travel through in either direction. This portal is vertical and circular, with a radius of 40 feet. The portal appears at a location of your choice on the destination plane, assuming you have a clear idea of both the destination's location on the plane and what the destination looks like. If you attempt to create a gate into or out of the realm of a deity or another powerful being, that being can prevent the gate from forming.
