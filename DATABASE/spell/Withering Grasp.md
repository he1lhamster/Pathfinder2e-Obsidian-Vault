Your touch rots organic material and decays objects. Make a melee spell attack roll. Your touch deals 1d12 negative damage plus 1d4 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent negative damage]]. If a creature uses an item to block _withering grasp_, such as with the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction, the item is automatically affected, but the creature does not take damage (even if there is damage left over after the shield’s Hardness). Unlike normal negative damage, the negative damage from _withering grasp_ damages objects, constructs, and the like by eroding them away.
**Critical Success** Your touch deals double damage (both initial and persistent). If you target an object, lower its Hardness by 4 for 1 minute.
**Success** Your touch deals full damage. If you target an object, lower its Hardness by 2 for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d12 and the persistent damage increases by 1. If you target an object, lower its Hardness by an additional 1 point on both a success and a critical success.
