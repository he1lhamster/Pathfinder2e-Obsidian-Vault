---
You draw elemental power from your surroundings, and combining it with your own magical energy, unleash a wave of utter destruction and swirling colors that deals 1d6 fire damage and 3d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the area and other parameters.
 <span class="action-icon">2</span> **(somatic, verbal)** The spell is a 30-foot cone.
 <span class="action-icon">3</span> **(material, somatic, verbal)** The spell is a 30-foot cone. On a failed saving throw, creatures are pushed 5 feet away from you, and on a critical failure they are pushed 10 feet away and are knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
 **Two Rounds** If you spend 3 actions Casting the Spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, the spell is as 3 actions, but the area is a 60-foot cone, and for 1 round, the elements linger in the cone, racing off into the distance and making approaching you difficult, with the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Gust of Wind|gust of wind]].

### Elemental Spell Changes

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]

You can replace the air trait with the metal and wood traits when you cast the spell.

---
**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 2d6, and the distance that enemies are pushed back if you spent 3 actions or 2 rounds increases by 5 feet on a failed save and 10 feet on a critical failure.
