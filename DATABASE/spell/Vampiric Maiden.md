A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4 negative damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. You gain temporary HP equal to the negative damage the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and the like). You lose any remaining temporary HP after 1 minute.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage.
**Failure** The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden. The target takes full damage and is [[Immobilized]] by the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to extricate itself, whichever comes first.
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it [[Escape]] (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The piercing and negative damage increase by 1d4 each.
