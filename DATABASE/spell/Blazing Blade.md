A scimitar-shaped beam of fiery light springs from your free hand. While the spell lasts, you can use a single action, which has the attack and concentrate traits, to burn your foes with the _blazing blade_. When you do, make a spell attack roll. On a success, the _blazing blade_ deals 1d6 fire damage plus 1d6 good damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, it deals double the usual damage.
