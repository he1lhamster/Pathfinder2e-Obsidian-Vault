You alter a creature's shadow, transforming it into a terrifying monster out to devour the creature. The creature must attempt a Will save. A creature that has the [[Frightened]] condition from _unspeakable shadow_ must spend at least one of its actions each turn to either attack its shadow (making a Strike ineffectually) or flee from its shadow (using one action to move away as though it had the [[Fleeing]] condition).
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is frightened 2.
**Failure** The target is frightened 3. It can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must succeed at a Fortitude save or die; this saving throw has the incapacitation trait. If it succeeds at its save, the target is frightened 4 and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.
