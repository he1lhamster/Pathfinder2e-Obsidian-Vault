You disrupt the connection between a divine caster or deific servitor and their deity, blocking their use of divine power. If the target fails its save, it is [[Fatigued]]. For the spell's duration, whenever the target casts a divine spell, you regain 6d6 HP and the target must attempt another Will save with the following effects.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** Each target of the divine spell has an outcome one degree of success better than the result it rolled.
**Failure** The divine spell is lost and target is [[Stunned]].
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is stunned for 1 round.
