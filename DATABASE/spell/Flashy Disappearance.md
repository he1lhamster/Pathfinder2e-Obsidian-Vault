You create a puff of colorful smoke that quickly disperses while you become temporarily [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]]. You become [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] to all creatures unless they can see invisible creatures. You Stride. At the end of your movement, if you have cover, greater cover, or [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealment]], attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]]. You gain a +2 status bonus to this Stealth check. The invisibility then ends, and you either become [[DATABASE/condition/Observed|observed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to creatures as determined by your check to Hide, if you made one.
