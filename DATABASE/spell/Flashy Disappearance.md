You create a puff of colorful smoke that quickly disperses while you become temporarily [[Invisible]]. You become [[Undetected]] to all creatures unless they can see invisible creatures. You Stride. At the end of your movement, if you have cover, greater cover, or [[Concealed]], attempt a [[Stealth]] check to [[Hide]]. You gain a +2 status bonus to this Stealth check. The invisibility then ends, and you either become [[Observed]] or [[Hidden]] to creatures as determined by your check to Hide, if you made one.
