You surround a moving creature with lifelike illusions, shifting their perception of the terrain to subtly lead them off course. The target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result, the creature is immune to _lose the path_ for 1 hour.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature treats all squares as difficult terrain for its Stride.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except that you determine where the target moves during the Stride, though you can't move it into hazardous terrain or to a place it can't stand.
