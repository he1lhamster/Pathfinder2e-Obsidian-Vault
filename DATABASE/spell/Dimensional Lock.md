You create a shimmering barrier that attempts to counteract teleportation effects and planar travel into or out of the area, including items that allow access to extradimensional spaces (such as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Bag of Holding|bag of holding]]). _Dimensional lock_ tries to counteract any attempt to summon a creature into the area but doesn't stop the creature from departing when the summoning ends.
