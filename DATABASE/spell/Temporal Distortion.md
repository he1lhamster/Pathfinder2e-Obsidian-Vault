You share some of your own temporal distortions with a foe, altering their mind and body unpredictably as they're thrown backward or forward in time. Roll 1d4. On a 1, the foe becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy]]; on a 2, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]]; on a 3, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]]; and on a 4, you choose which condition applies.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is either clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, or stupefied 1 for 4 rounds, depending on the result of the d4.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the time warp is stronger, increasing the condition's effects but making it run its course faster. The condition's value is 3, and the condition lasts for 2 rounds.
