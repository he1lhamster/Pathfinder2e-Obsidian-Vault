Your litany rails against the sin of wrath, punishing the target for attacking good creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly wrathful creature, such as a [[DATABASE/monster/Vrock (Wrath Demon)|wrath demon]], uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target then becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The first time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes 3d6 good damage.
**Failure** Each time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes 3d6 good damage.
**Critical Failure** The target is enfeebled 2. Each time it uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes 3d6 good damage.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
