You examine the time stream in a particular area, then proceed to stick a few metaphorical pins into it, thickening and slowing down the flow of time until it rumbles along like a river of molasses. Any creature that begins its turn in the area must attempt a Will save.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is [[Slowed]] this turn.
**Critical Failure** The creature is slowed 2 this turn.
