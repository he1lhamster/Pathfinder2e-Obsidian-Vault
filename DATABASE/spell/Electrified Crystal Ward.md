You create an [[DATABASE/hazard/Electric Latch Rune|electric latch rune]] hazard on the target, creating a special crystalline lock on the object. You can also substitute your spell DC for any of the hazard’s listed DCs. You can have only one such hazard active at a time, and if you cast this spell while a previous _electric latch rune_ is active, the older hazard discharges harmlessly.

**Heightened (+2)** The hazard’s damage increases by 1d12.
