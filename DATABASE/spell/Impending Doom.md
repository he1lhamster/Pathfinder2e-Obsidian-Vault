You sift through myriad potential futures, seize upon one potential moment in which the target meets a particularly gruesome and fatal end, and then show it a vision of its impending demise. The intense mental vision grows more and more terrifying to the target as the doom grows closer, and it takes 3 rounds to reach its conclusion. The target must attempt a Will saving throw to determine the effects. At the end of the spell's duration, if the target was affected, the target witnesses its death and takes 6d6 mental damage.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
