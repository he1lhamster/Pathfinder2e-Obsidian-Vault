You cause the creature's vision to become particularly sensitive. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature is dazzled for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The creature gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Light Blindness|light blindness]] for 1 minute. If the creature is already exposed to bright light, it immediately becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]], as it isn't acclimated to its newly acquired light blindness.
