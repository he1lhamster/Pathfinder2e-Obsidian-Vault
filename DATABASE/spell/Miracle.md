You request aid directly from your divine source. Your divine source always refuses a request out of line with its nature, and it might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A casting of _miracle_ can do any of the following things.

* Duplicate any spell from the divine list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
* Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.
* Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. 
* Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[Wish]] spell.

The GM might allow you to try using _miracle_ to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.
