You wrap the targeted creatures in thin, sickly green shrouds that sap information from attackers. The shroud settles about each target's shoulders, granting a +1 status bonus to AC and a +2 status bonus to [[Stealth]] checks, both only while the target is in dim light or darkness.
 If a creature deals damage in melee to or touches a cloaked creature, the cloak wraps around the attacker, temporarily connecting the psyches of the cloaked creature and the attacker and violently prying a random piece of interesting information from the attacker's mind. The attacker takes 2d8 mental damage and must attempt a Will save. Afterward, the spell ends for the cloaked creature, and the attacker is temporarily immune to _mirecloak_ for 24 hours.
**Critical Success** The attacker is unaffected.
**Success** The attacker takes half damage.
**Failure** The attacker takes full damage and is [[Sickened]]. In addition, the cloaked creature gleans a piece of information from the attacker's mind. The details and extent of this information are at the GM's discretion.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the attacker takes double damage and is sickened 2.
