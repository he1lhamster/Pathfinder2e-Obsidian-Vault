You expand the target's ability to understand social cues that are normally beyond its comprehension. Any creature to which the target isn't [[Unfriendly]] or [[Hostile]] can use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make an Impression]] on it and to make very simple [[Request]] of it. This doesn't render the animal any more inclined to help than it otherwise would be.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell can also target plants and fungi.
