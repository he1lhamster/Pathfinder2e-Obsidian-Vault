You expand the target's ability to understand social cues that are normally beyond its comprehension. Any creature to which the target isn't [[DATABASE/condition/Unfriendly|unfriendly]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Hostile|hostile]] can use [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on it and to make very simple [[DATABASE/action/Request|Requests]] of it. This doesn't render the animal any more inclined to help than it otherwise would be.
