You cultivate four wooden bulbs, each filled with toxic pollen and sensitive to motion. When a creature enters a space adjacent to a bulb, or when a bulb is touched or damaged (each bulb has AC 5), the bulb blossoms and releases pollen in a 15-foot emanation. Creatures in the area take 8d8 poison damage and must attempt a Fortitude save with the following results.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage, becomes dazzled for 1 round, and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is dazzled for 1 round, and becomes stupefied 2 for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d8.
