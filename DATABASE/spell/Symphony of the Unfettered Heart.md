Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns. Attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check to counteract one of the following conditions affecting the target: [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned]]. If you fail, you can't target that effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC for grabbed).
