You enchant a single object, preventing it from being used for magical observation. If you cast this spell on a non-magical item used to cast scrying spells, such as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Material Component Pouch|spell component pouch]] or a spell focus, the item can't be used to cast the spell. If you cast _blind eye_ on a magical item that can be activated to scry (such as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Crystal Ball|crystal ball]] or [[DATABASE/equipment/Hag Eye|hag eye]]), the item can't be activated for scrying effects. Magical items that are twice _blind eye's_ spell level or more aren't blocked this way.
