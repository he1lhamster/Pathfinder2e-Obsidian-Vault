You flood the target with energy from the terrain around it, compressing centuries of evolution into a single moment. The target gains one of the following natural adaptations based on the surrounding environment.

* **Aquatic** The target gains a swim Speed equal to its land Speed. If it already had a swim Speed, it gains a +10-foot status bonus to its swim Speed.
* **Arctic** The target isn't affected by severe or extreme cold, and when it rolls a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] on ice and snow, it gets a critical success instead.
* **Desert** The target isn't affected by severe or extreme heat, and when it rolls a success on an Acrobatics check to Balance on sand, it gets a critical success instead.
* **Forest** The target gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Scent|scent]] as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet.
* **Mountain** The target isn't [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] when [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climbing]], and when it rolls a success on an Acrobatics check to Balance on rubble, it gets a critical success instead.
* **Plains** The target gains a +10-foot status bonus to its land Speed.
