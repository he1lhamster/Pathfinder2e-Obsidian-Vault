A sickly yellow light fills the area as entropic forces prevent healing. When a creature within the area would regain Hit Points, such as from a healing effect or an ability like fast healing or regeneration, it must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature regains the full number of Hit Points that would be restored by the healing effect, and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Success** The creature regains the full number of Hit Points that would be restored.
**Failure** The creature regains only half the number of Hit Points that would be restored.
**Critical Failure** The creature does not regain Hit Points from the healing effect.
