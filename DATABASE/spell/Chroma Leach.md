Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars, and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome trait take a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]]. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is permanently enfeebled 2 and drained 2 (although magic such as [[DATABASE/spell/Restoration|restoration]] can reduce or remove these conditions).
