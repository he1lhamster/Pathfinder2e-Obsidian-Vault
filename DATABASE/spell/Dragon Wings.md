Leathery wings sprout from your back, giving you a fly Speed of 60 feet or your Speed, whichever is faster. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as [[Feather Fall]]. You can increase the Focus Point cost by 1 to gain the effects of [[Dragon Claws]] as long as the wings last.

**Heightened (8th)** The duration increases to 10 minutes.
