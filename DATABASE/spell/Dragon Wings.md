Leathery wings sprout from your back, giving you a fly Speed of 60 feet or your Speed, whichever is faster. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as [[DATABASE/spell/Feather Fall|feather fall]]. You can increase the Focus Point cost by 1 to gain the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Dragon Claws|dragon claws]] as long as the wings last.
