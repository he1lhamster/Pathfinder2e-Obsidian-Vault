You draw forth a hag's innate jealousy to deny a target its greatest attribute. The target is cursed with an adverse condition depending on its highest ability modifier: Strength (enfeebled); Dexterity (clumsy); Constitution (drained); or Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (stupefied). On a tie, the creature decides which of the conditions associated with the tied ability modifiers to take. The target must attempt a Will save.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The condition's value is 1.
**Critical Failure** The condition's value is 2.
At the start of each of your turns, the target can attempt another Will save, ending the effect on a success.
