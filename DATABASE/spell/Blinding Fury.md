You curse the target with your outrage at being attacked. The effect is determined by the target's Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target can't observe you until the end of its turn, and if you're currently [[Observed]] by it, you become [[Hidden]] to it.
**Failure** As success, and for 1 minute, every time the target damages you, it can't observe you until the end of its turn.
**Critical Failure** As success, and for an unlimited duration, the first time each round the target damages a creature, it can't observe that creature until the end of its turn. If it damages several creatures at once, the creature it can't perceive is chosen randomly among those creatures.
