You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the Raise a Shield action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn't require a hand to use.
 While the spell is in effect, you can use the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 5. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can't cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell's reaction against the [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Missile|magic missile]] spell.
 Heightening the spell increases the shield's Hardness.

---
**Heightened (3rd)** The shield has Hardness 10.
**Heightened (5th)** The shield has Hardness 15.
**Heightened (7th)** The shield has Hardness 20.
**Heightened (9th)** The shield has Hardness 25.
