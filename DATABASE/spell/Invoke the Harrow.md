You draw a card from the harrow, either one from a deck you have in hand or magically produce one as part of the spell. You use the power of the card's suit to influence a creature around you. When you draw a card, you can choose to impart a boon or bane associated with the card's suit. The target must attempt a Will save. On a failure, they receive the effects of the chosen boon or bane. If you target an ally with this spell, they can choose to willingly accept the effects without attempting a saving throw. The target can attempt to remove the card's influence by using an action, which has the concentrate trait, to attempt the saving throw again; on a success, the effect ends.
 To determine the card, draw a card from a [[Harrow Deck]]. If you don't have a harrow deck available, you can roll 1d6 to randomly determine the suit you draw.

1. **Hammers (Str)** Boon: The target gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls; Bane: The target is [[Enfeebled]].
2. **Keys (Dex)** Boon: The target gains a +1 status bonus to AC; Bane: The target is [[Clumsy]].
3. **Shields (Con)** Boon: The target gains temporary Hit Points equal to twice the spell's level; Bane: The target is [[Drained]].
4. **Books (Int)** Boon: The target gains a +1 status bonus to skill checks; Bane: The target is [[Stupefied]].
5. **Stars (Wis)** Boon: The target gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws; Bane: The target is [[Confused]].
6. **Crowns (Cha)** Boon: The target can roll twice and take the higher result on a single check during the duration. This is a fortune effect; Bane: The target must roll twice and take the lower result on a single check of your choosing during the duration. This is a misfortune effect.

**Heightened (6th)** The duration is 1 minute. The target must succeed a total of two saving throws to end the effect. The value of boons and banes doubles. The Crowns suit affects a total of three checks during the duration.
