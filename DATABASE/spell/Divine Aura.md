Divine power wards the targets, granting each a +1 status bonus to AC and saves while in the area.
 Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. The bonuses granted by the spell increase to +2 against attacks by—and effects created by—creatures with an alignment opposite to the spell (lawful if you chose chaotic, evil if you chose good). These bonuses increase to +4 against effects created by such creatures that attempt to impose the [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]] condition on a target of your _divine aura_, as well as against attacks made by creatures summoned by anything opposite in alignment to your _divine aura_.
 When a creature of opposite alignment hits a target with a melee attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 minute. It's then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
 The first time you Sustain the Spell each round, the _divine aura_'s radius grows 10 feet.
