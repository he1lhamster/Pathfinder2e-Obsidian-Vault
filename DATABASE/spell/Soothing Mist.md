You call forth a magical mist of positive energy that envelops a creature. The mist restores 2d8 Hit Points to a target living creature and ends one source of [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent acid, bleed, fire, negative, or poison damage]] affecting it. If the creature is taking persistent damage from multiple sources, you select which one is removed. Against an undead target, you deal 2d8 positive damage (basic Fortitude save); if it fails the save, it also takes 2 persistent positive damage.

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing (or damage to an undead target) increases by 1d8, and the persistent positive damage to an undead creature increases by 1.
