You shroud the target in subtle illusions that make it difficult to detect. The target gains a +1 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] or [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]]. For the duration, the target can become [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to a creature even if they don't have cover and aren't otherwise [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] from that creature. Even if the target isn't concealed or doesn't have cover or greater cover at the end of a Sneak action, the target isn't automatically [[DATABASE/condition/Observed|observed]].
