You shroud the target in subtle illusions that make it difficult to detect. The target gains a +1 status bonus to [[Stealth]] checks to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]]. For the duration, the target can become [[Hidden]] to a creature even if they don't have cover and aren't otherwise [[Concealed]] from that creature. Even if the target isn't concealed or doesn't have cover or greater cover at the end of a Sneak action, the target isn't automatically [[Observed]].
