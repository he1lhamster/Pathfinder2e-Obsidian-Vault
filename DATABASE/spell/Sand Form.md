You grant the target's body and gear aspects of sand. The target gains resistance 5 to piercing and slashing damage, has no scent, and can't bleed. In sandy terrain, even when out in the open, the target has enough concealment to attempt to [[Hide]]. Each time the target takes damage to which sand form grants resistance, reduce the duration of the spell by 1 minute.

**Heightened (5th)** The resistance is 10.
**Heightened (7th)** The resistance is 15.
