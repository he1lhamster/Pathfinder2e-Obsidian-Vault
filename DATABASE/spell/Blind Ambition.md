You strengthen a target's ambition, increase its resentment of allies, and make its allegiances more susceptible to change. The target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to its saving throws and other defenses against attempts to Coerce it, Request something of it, or use mental effects to convince it to do something (such as a [[DATABASE/spell/Suggestion|suggestion]] spell). This penalty applies only if the target is being encouraged to advance its own ambitions.
**Failure** As success, but the penalty is –2.
**Critical Failure** The target is overcome with ambition, taking whatever actions would advance its own agenda over those of anyone else, even without attempts to convince it.
