All creatures in the area when you cast the spell are limned in colorful, heatless fire of a color of your choice for the duration. Visible creatures can't be concealed while affected by _faerie fire_. If the creatures are invisible, they are concealed while affected by _faerie fire_, rather than being undetected.
