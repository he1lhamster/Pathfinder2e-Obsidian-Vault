Merging minds with the target, you swap disorienting visions from one another's nightmares. One of you will become confused, but which it'll be depends on the target's Will save.
**Critical Success** You are confused for 1 round.
**Success** At the start of your next turn, you spend your first action with the confused condition, then act normally.
**Failure** As success, but the target is affected instead of you, spending its first action each turn confused. The duration is 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The target is confused for 1 minute.
