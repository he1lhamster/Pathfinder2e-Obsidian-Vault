Sadness flows out of you into nearby creatures, blotting out any other thoughts they had. The first time a creature begins its turn in the area or enters the area, it must attempt a Will save. If it later leaves and reenters the area, it uses the same effect as before.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes a –1 status penalty to skill checks and Perception checks as long as it remains in the area.
**Failure** While the creature is in the area, any emotion effects of lower counteract level than _overflowing sorrow_ are suppressed, and whenever the creature attempts to use an emotion action or cast an emotion spell, it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check or the action or spell is disrupted.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature cannot use emotion actions or spells.

**Heightened (+2)** When you Cast the Spell, you can choose to increase the area by 5 feet.
