You materialize a [[DATABASE/equipment/Musical Instrument|handheld musical instrument]] in your grasp. The instrument is typical for its type, but it plays only for you. The instrument vanishes when the spell ends. If you cast _summon instrument_ again, any instrument you previously summoned disappears.

**Heightened (5th)** The instrument is instead a virtuoso handheld instrument.
