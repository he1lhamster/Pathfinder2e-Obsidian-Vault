**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half the mental damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of its turn.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]], and is flat-footed until the start of your next turn.
