You see the target as though it's dissected and arrayed before you. For the duration, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] checks against the target that depend on its organs, but a –2 circumstance penalty on Medicine checks depending on seeing its skin.
 When you Cast the Spell, attempt a special [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check using Medicine to spot and discern a vital organ. If you have a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill appropriate to the creature, you can use that skill instead of Medicine. If you succeed, the next time you deal piercing or slashing damage to the target with a Strike or spell, you deal 4d6 additional precision damage. Once on each of your subsequent turns, you can use a single action to attempt the special Recall Knowledge check again. The extra damage isn't cumulative, so making the check more than once before a Strike or spell has no extra benefit.

**Heightened (+1)** The precision damage increases by 1d6.
