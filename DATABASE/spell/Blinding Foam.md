You spray a colorful, caustic foam into the target's eyes, which clings to their face. Make a spell attack roll. If you hit, you deal 5d10 acid damage and 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent acid damage]], and the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for the duration. The foam can be removed with 3 Interact actions, which ends the persistent acid damage. These Interact actions don't need to be consecutive. When the target's persistent acid damage ends, the spell automatically ends.

**Heightened (8th)** The initial damage increases to 9d10, and the persistent acid damage increases to 2d6.
