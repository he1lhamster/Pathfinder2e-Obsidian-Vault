Your competitiveness drives you to prove yourself against the opposition. You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks. If an enemy within 20 feet critically succeeds at an attack roll or skill check, your status bonus increases to +3 attack rolls or that specific skill check (whichever the foe critically succeeded at) for 1 round.

**Heightened (7th)** Increase the base bonus to +2 and the increased bonus after an enemy critically succeeds to +4.
