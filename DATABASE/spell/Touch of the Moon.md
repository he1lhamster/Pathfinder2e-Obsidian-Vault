When you touch the target, a symbol of the moon appears on its forehead, glowing with soft moonlight. The target glows with dim light in a 20-foot radius. It also gets a benefit based on a phase of the moon, starting with the new moon and changing to the next phase at the end of each of its turns.

* **New Moon** The target receives no benefit. 
* **Waxing Moon** The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +4 status bonus to damage rolls. 
* **Full Moon** The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, AC, and saving throws and a +4 status bonus to damage rolls. 
* **Waning Moon** The target gains a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws. After this phase, return to the new moon.
