The target becomes distracted and suggestible, inundated by vivid daydreams.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target's attention wavers. It becomes [[Flat-Footed]] and [[Fascinated]] by its daydreams.
**Failure** As success, except that you appear in the dream and give a suggestion. This can be to approach you, run away (as if it had the [[Fleeing]] condition), [[Release]] what it's holding, [[Drop Prone]], or stand in place. The creature follows this course of action as its first action after you Cast the Spell.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as possible for the spell's duration, and it does nothing else.
