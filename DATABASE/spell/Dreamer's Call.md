The target becomes distracted and suggestible, inundated by vivid daydreams.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target's attention wavers. It becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] by its daydreams.
**Failure** As success, except that you appear in the dream and give a suggestion. This can be to approach you, run away (as if it had the [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] condition), [[DATABASE/action/Release|Release]] what it's holding, [[DATABASE/action/Drop Prone|Drop Prone]], or stand in place. The creature follows this course of action as its first action after you Cast the Spell.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as possible for the spell's duration, and it does nothing else.
