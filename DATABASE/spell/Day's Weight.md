You fast-forward time for a single creature, burdening it with the aches and pain of an entire day and making it temporarily tired and weak. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[Fatigued]] and [[Enfeebled]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is fatigued and enfeebled 1 for the duration.
**Critical Failure** The target is fatigued and enfeebled 2 for the duration. The fatigued condition doesn't end when the spell's duration does (but can still be removed with a night's rest or by similar means).

---
**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
