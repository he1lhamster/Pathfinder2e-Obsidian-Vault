You cause a splash of cold water to descend on an ally's head, granting some temporary vigor. The target gains 1d4 temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute. The target is then temporarily immune to the temporary Hit Points from _rousing splash_ for 10 minutes. The target can also attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent acid or fire damage]], with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of temporary Hit Points granted increases by 1d4.
