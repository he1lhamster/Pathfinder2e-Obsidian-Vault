You evoke a jumble of rocks in the area. The scattering rocks deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier to creatures in the area, with a basic Reflex save. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. A creature can Interact to clear a square of this scree.
 If you cast this spell again, any previous _scatter scree_ you have cast ends.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
