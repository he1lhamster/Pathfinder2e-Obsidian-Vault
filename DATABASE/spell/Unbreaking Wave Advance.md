You unleash a mighty wave from your hand that buffets back your foes. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If a creature pushed by _unbreaking wave advance_ would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes 3d6 damage.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is pushed 10 feet.
**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The damage for pushing a creature into a solid barrier increases by 1d6.
