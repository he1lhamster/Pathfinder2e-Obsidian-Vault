Through the strength of your faith, your body becomes infused with holy energy. You have weakness 5 to evil. Any creature that touches or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon takes 1d6 good damage. Your unarmed attacks deal an additional 1 good damage. Your [[DATABASE/domain/Healing Domain|healing]] spells that restore Hit Points restore an additional 1d4 Hit Points when you initially cast them; as normal, if your healing spell restores Hit Points more than once, grants fast healing, or the like, the additional Hit Points still only apply once.
