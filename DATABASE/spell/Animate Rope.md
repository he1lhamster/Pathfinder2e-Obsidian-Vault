You cause a length or section of rope or a rope-like object to animate and follow simple commands. You can give it two commands when you Cast the Spell, and one command each time you Sustain the Spell.

* **Bind** (attack) The rope attempts to partially bind a creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed (–20-foot on a critical success). This ends if the target [[Escape]] against your spell DC or breaks the rope. (A standard adventuring rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.)
* **Coil** The rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.
* **Crawl** The rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.
* **Knot** The rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.
* **Loop** The rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.
* **Tie** The rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.
* **Undo** The rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.
