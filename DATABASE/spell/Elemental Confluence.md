You conjure four types of elementals who combine forces to form into a chaotic storm. The confluence has AC 28 and 120 Hit Points, weakness 10 to area effects, and immunity to bleed and poison. Creatures can move through the confluence; creatures within the confluence are [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the confluence are concealed to creatures within it. When you Cast or Sustain this Spell, you choose up to two different types of elementals to act.

### Secrets of Magic

* **Air** (air, electricity) The elemental looses a bolt of electricity from the confluence, dealing 4d4 electricity damage to creatures within 20 feet of the confluence, with a basic Reflex save. This doesn't affect creatures that are completely inside of the confluence.
* **Earth** (earth) The confluence gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and resistance 10 to all physical damage (except [[Adamantine Weapon]]) for 1 round.
* **Fire** (fire) Flames roar through the confluence, dealing 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]] to those partially or entirely inside the confluence.
* **Water** (attack, water) The elemental expels a powerful jet of water. Attempt a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet of the confluence, using your spell attack roll modifier. This attack ignores concealment granted by the confluence, and the elemental gets a +2 circumstance bonus on the spell attack roll against a target inside the confluence. The water deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit (doubled on a critical hit). This attack doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.

### Rage of Elements

* **Metal** (metal) The elemental flings shards of metal through the confluence, dealing 2d6 slashing damage to those partially or entirely inside the confluence with a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails also takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]].
* **Wood** (wood) Roots and stumps grow, making ground in the area difficult terrain.
