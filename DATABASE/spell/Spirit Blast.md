You concentrate ethereal energy and attack a creature's spirit, dealing 16d6 force damage. Because _spirit blast_ affects the creature's spirit, it can damage a target projecting its consciousness (such as via [[Project Image]]) or possessing another creature even if the target's body is elsewhere. The possessed creature isn't harmed by the blast. The blast doesn't harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
