You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and collapse structures.
 The GM might add additional effects in certain areas. Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface, leaving a morass of quicksand.

* **Shaking Ground** The ground is difficult terrain, and creatures on it take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks. 
* **Fissures** Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require DC 15 Athletics to Climb. 
* **Collapse** Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it.
**Critical Success** The creature takes half the collapse damage.
**Success** The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls prone.
**Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls prone.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.

**Heightened (10th)** You create a massive earthquake that can devastate a settlement. The range increases to half a mile and the area to a quarter-mile burst.
