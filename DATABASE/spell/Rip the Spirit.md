You supernaturally rip the spirit from a living creature's body, dooming the target to pain and death. The target takes 5d6 negative damage, depending on its basic Fortitude save, and is drained 1 if it fails its save. The spell's effect is based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.
 <span class="action-icon">1</span> **(somatic)** The spell targets one living creature in range. 
 <span class="action-icon">2</span> **(somatic, verbal)** The spell targets one living creature in range and the damage is 10d6 negative instead of 5d6. 
 <span class="action-icon">3</span> **(material, somatic, verbal)** The spell targets all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation.

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of damage increases by 1d6, or by 2d6 for the 2-action version.
