You instantly transport yourself from one shadow to another. Teleport yourself and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to a clear space you can see that's in dim light or darkness and within range. You can transport your familiar with this spell, but if _shadow jump_ would bring any other creature with you—even if you're carrying the creature in an extradimensional container—the spell is disrupted.

**Heightened (8th)** When you arrive at your destination, you can become [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] until the end of your next turn or until you are no longer in an area of dim light or darkness, whichever comes first. The invisibility is an illusion effect.
