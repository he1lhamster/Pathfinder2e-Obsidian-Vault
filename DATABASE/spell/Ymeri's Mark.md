You place the fiery mark of the [[DATABASE/deity/Ymeri|Queen of the Inferno]] on the target, burning into the creature's very essence. The mark gives off a heat that only you can sense; as long as you're on the same plane as the target, you can sense the direction it's in. The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] and can't reduce the value of this condition normally.
 You can detonate the mark at any point during its duration by Dismissing the spell. The rune explodes in a 10-foot emanation centered on the target that deals 5d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save. You choose whether the mark's target is included in the explosion.
 When you cast the spell, the target attempts a Fortitude save to determine how long the mark lasts. If the spell's duration elapses, the rune doesn't detonate.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The duration is 1 minute.
**Failure** The duration is 1 week.
**Critical Failure** The duration is unlimited.
