Razor sharp coral growths erupt from the ground, transforming the landscape into a dangerous coral reef. You can create a third nonoverlapping burst if the centers of all three bursts are underwater. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 6d6 piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]. The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain.
 A creature that moves through the area takes 3 piercing damage for every square of that area it moves into.

**Heightened (+2)** The initial piercing damage increases by 3d6, and the hazardous terrain damage increases by 1.
