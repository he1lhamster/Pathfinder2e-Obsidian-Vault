You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who casts [[DATABASE/spell/Object Reading|object reading]] on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a [[DATABASE/spell/Retrocognition|retrocognition]] spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don't interfere with any other visions.
 If the object is targeted with [[DATABASE/spell/Read Aura|read aura]] of a higher spell level than _imprint message_, the caster learns that the object has been magically modified. When you Cast this Spell, any prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of _imprint message_ fade.
