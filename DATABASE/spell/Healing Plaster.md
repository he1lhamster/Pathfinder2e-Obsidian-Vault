You purify some dirt or mud into a pliable, claylike plaster that can aid in clotting and healing. This restorative substance can be used in lieu of [[DATABASE/equipment/Healer's Tools|healer's tools]] for [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Administer First Aid|Administer First Aid]] or [[DATABASE/action/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]. If the plaster isn't used within the spell's duration, or if you Cast the Spell again before using the plaster, it reverts to being normal non-magical earth.

**Heightened (3rd)** The plaster grants anyone using it to Administer First Aid or Treat Wounds a +1 item bonus to the Medicine check.
