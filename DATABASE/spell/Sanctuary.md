You ward a creature with protective energy that deters enemy attacks. Creatures attempting to attack the target must attempt a Will save each time. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends.
**Critical Success** _Sanctuary_ ends.
**Success** The creature can attempt its attack and any other attacks against the target this turn.
**Failure** The creature can't attack the target and wastes the action. It can't attempt further attacks against the target this turn.
**Critical Failure** The creature wastes the action and can't attempt to attack the target for the rest of _sanctuary_'s duration.
