You create a thin layer of foamy bubbles that adhere to the target, causing it to float in water and similar liquids. The target doesn't sink, even if it hasn't succeeded at a [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]] check this round; an already-sinking target resurfaces with the bubbles' help over the course of 1 round. If on a plane where the water or liquid has a surface, the bubbles also prevent the target from diving beneath that surface unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your spell DC.

**Heightened (4th)** You can target up to 5 creatures.
