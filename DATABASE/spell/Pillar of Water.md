You create a large, self-contained cylinder of still, clear fresh water. You choose the radius and height of the pillar, to a maximum radius of 15 feet and a maximum height of 60 feet. Creatures inside the pillar can [[Swim]] through the water as normal ([[Athletics]] DC 10), or if the spell was cast on solid ground, walk along the bottom (which is difficult terrain). Any creature that exits the pillar falls or lands accordingly.
