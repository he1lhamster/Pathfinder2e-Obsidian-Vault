You infuse a target with spiritual energy, refreshing its magic. If it prepares spells, it recovers one 6th-level or lower spell it previously cast today and can cast that spell again. If it spontaneously casts spells, it recovers one of its 6th-level or lower spell slots. If it has a focus pool, it regains its Focus Points, as if it had [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocused]].
