Giving the air a push, you buffet the target with a powerful gust of wind; it must attempt a Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is pushed 5 feet away from you.
**Failure** The target is pushed 10 feet away from you.
**Critical Failure** The target is pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone.
