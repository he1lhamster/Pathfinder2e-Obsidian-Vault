You draw the target into a drowsy state, causing daydreams and sluggishness. The target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to Perception, attack rolls, and Will saves. This penalty increases to –2 for Will saves against sleep effects.
**Failure** As success, and any time the target uses a concentrate action, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is disrupted.
