You transform the target to make it match your artisanal and artistic vision. If you have expert proficiency in Crafting, the item grants a +1 item bonus to attack rolls if it's a weapon or skill checks if it's a skill tool. The target is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously temporary, so its monetary value doesn't change.
 When you cast this spell, any previous _artistic flourish_ you had cast ends.
