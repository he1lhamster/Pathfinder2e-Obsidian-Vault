Leaving nothing to chance, you weave divinatory precautions against an ambush, alerting the target to danger. Once during the duration of this spell, the target can roll one Perception, [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] initiative roll twice and take the better result, after which the spell ends. The strain of staying so prepared is too much for a mind to handle for long; the target is temporarily immune to this spell for 24 hours once the spell ends, whether they used the initiative benefit or not.
