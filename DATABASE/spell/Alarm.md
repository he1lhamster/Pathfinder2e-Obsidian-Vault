You ward an area to alert you when creatures enter without your permission. When you cast _alarm_, select a password. Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature enters the spell's area without speaking the password, _alarm_ sends your choice of a mental alert (in which case the spell gains the mental trait) or an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell (in which case the spell gains the auditory trait). Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check against the spell's DC or trigger the spell when moving into the area.
