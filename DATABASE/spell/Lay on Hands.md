Your hands become infused with positive energy, healing a living creature or damaging an undead creature with a touch. If you use _lay on hands_ on a willing living target, you restore 6 Hit Points; if the target is one of your allies, they also gain a +2 status bonus to AC for 1 round. Against an undead target, you deal 1d6 damage and it must attempt a basic Fortitude save; if it fails, it also takes a –2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing increases by 6, and the damage to an undead target increases by 1d6.
