You understand that holding a secret is in itself a kind of power. Each target must attempt a Will save.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** A rune symbolizing a secret the target is keeping (at the GM's discretion) appears floating in front of you. If that creature attempts a Strike or spell attack against you while you hold their secret, you can discharge the rune as a reaction to deal 7d6 mental damage to the creature.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes convinced you know their secret and takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent mental damage]] from worry. If the rune with the secret is discharged while the creature is still taking the persistent mental damage, the persistent mental damage immediately ends.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 2d6, and the persistent mental damage on a critical failure increases by 1.
