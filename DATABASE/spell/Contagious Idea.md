Nothing is so contagious as a thought. You place either a pleasant thought or a terrifying one in a creature's mind. You can then plant the same thought in a second creature's mind. You can't choose a creature that's already been a target of this casting of _contagious idea_, nor can you choose yourself. The second target can be beyond the range of the spell, but it must be within 30 feet of the first target.

* **Pleasant Thought** The target is soothed, gaining 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute.
* **Terrifying Thought** The target must attempt a Will save.**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]] and is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.**Failure** The target becomes frightened 2.**Critical Failure** The target becomes frightened 3.

**Heightened (+1)** The temporary Hit Points for a pleasant thought increase by 1.

---
**Amp** You can choose to spread the thought from the second target to a third target, in the same manner as spreading it from the first target to the second. A pleasant thought grants twice as many temporary Hit Points (10, plus an additional 2 for each level heightened).
