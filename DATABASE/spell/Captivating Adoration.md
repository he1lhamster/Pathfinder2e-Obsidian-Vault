You become intensely entrancing, and creatures are distracted by you as long as they remain within the area. You can exclude any creatures you choose from the effects.
 When a creature enters the area for the first time, it must attempt a Will saving throw. If a creature leaves and reenters, it uses the results of its original save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune for 1 hour.
**Success** The creature is fascinated with you for its next action, then is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
**Failure** The creature is fascinated with you.
**Critical Failure** The creature is fascinated with you, and its attitude toward you improves by one step.
