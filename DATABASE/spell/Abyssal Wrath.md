You evoke the energy of an Abyssal realm. The damage types of the spell (one energy and one physical) are based on the result of rolling on the table below.

## Abyssal Wrath

|   1d4 | Realm    | Manifestation                         | Damage Type                 |
|------:|:---------|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------|
|     1 | Skies    | Bolts and lightning and flying debris | Bludgeoning and electricity |
|     2 | Depths   | Acid and demonic shells               | Acid and slashing           |
|     3 | Frozen   | Frigid air and ice                    | Bludgeoning and cold        |
|     4 | Volcanic | Jagged volcanic rocks and magma       | Fire and piercing           |
