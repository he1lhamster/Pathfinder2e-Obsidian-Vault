You state a wish, making your greatest desire come true. A wish spell can produce any one of the following effects.

* Duplicate any spell from the arcane list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
* Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.
* Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. 
* Reverse certain effects that refer to the _wish_ spell.

The GM might allow you to try using _wish_ to produce greater effects than these, but doing so might be dangerous or the spell might have only a partial effect.
