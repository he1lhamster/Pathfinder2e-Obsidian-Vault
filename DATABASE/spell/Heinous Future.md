You hold up a fractured mirror to the target, and in that mirror it sees a thing that may yet come to pass—a ghastly fortelling that the target instinctively knows is eerily possible. It's not a guaranteed thing, just a dreadful possibility, but it haunts the targets's thoughts all the same.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] 1 and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] 1 for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is slowed 1 and stupefied 1 until it next gets eight hours of rest.
**Critical Failure** The target is slowed 2 and stupefied 2, decreasing these conditions by 1 for each eight hours of rest it gets.
