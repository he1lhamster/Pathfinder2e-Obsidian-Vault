Drawing your hand in a sweeping gesture, you shroud the target in a veil of night. The target's eyes are blanketed in darkness. If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with [[DATABASE/monsterability/Light Blindness|light blindness]]), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The target is shrouded in murky darkness. Unless the target has darkvision, other creatures are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] to it.
