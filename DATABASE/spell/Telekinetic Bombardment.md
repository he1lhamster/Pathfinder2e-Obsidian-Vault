You grasp a piece of the landscape—such as a tree, carriage, or piece of masonry—and lob it in your foe's direction. Your missile crashes down in either a 10-foot burst (for most missiles) or a 30-foot line (for something long and tall, like a tree or a ship's mast), dealing 14d6 bludgeoning damage and turning its area into difficult terrain as it breaks into rubble. All creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save. If the area is a line, it doesn't have to start from your square but can instead start anywhere in range, as long as the entire area remains within range.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knocked [[Prone]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked prone, and is [[Stunned]].

---
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
