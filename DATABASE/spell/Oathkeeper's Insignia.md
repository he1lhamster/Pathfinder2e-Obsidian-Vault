A magical indicator assures a creature that you’ve upheld your end of a bargain. When you Cast the Spell, you create a bracelet, flower, or other such trinket. If, while the spell persists, you complete the terms of the promise or deal you made, the trinket fades away with a pleasant chime; if you violate the terms instead, the trinket breaks with a dissonant crash.
