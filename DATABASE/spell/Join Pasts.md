With touches to the targets’ foreheads, you bring them into mental communion. The targets can share thoughts and experiences, but not words. When one target attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], the other can [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] the first target’s skill check, using any [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill (even if that Lore wouldn’t normally apply) without having made any preparations to Aid.

**Heightened (+1)** You can touch one additional target to include them in the spell’s effects. Multiple targets can attempt checks to Aid the target who is attempting to Recall Knowledge.
