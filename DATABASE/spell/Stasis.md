The flow of time congeals around an object or creature, holding it in place. The target must attempt a Will save (an unattended object automatically critically fails its save).
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[Stunned]] as time thickens around it.
**Failure** Time ceases to pass for the target for 1 round. It is invulnerable to all damage, it cannot be targeted or affected by anything, and no rounds elapse for any timed durations, conditions, afflictions, and other effects it has. While in _stasis_, the target can’t be moved, and it remains fixed in place, defying gravity if need be.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is held in stasis for 3 rounds. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round or end it entirely on a critical success.
