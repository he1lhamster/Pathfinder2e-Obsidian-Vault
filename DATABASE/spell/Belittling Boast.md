You boast about your skills or combat prowess, bolstering your own abilities and belittling your opponents. Select one of the following to boast about: melee attack rolls, ranged attack rolls, spell attack rolls, or a single skill. Attempt an [[Intimidation]] check to [[Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet. Each creature that becomes [[Frightened]] additionally takes a –1 circumstance penalty to the attack roll or skill you boasted about for 1 minute. If at least one creature becomes frightened, you gain a +1 status penalty to the attack roll or skill you boasted about for 1 minute.
