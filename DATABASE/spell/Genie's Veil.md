With a flourish, you fulfill a creature's wish for protection, bending reality to keep them from harm. The target vanishes in a burst of brightly colored smoke and sparkles, reappearing an instant later. They become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] against the triggering attack and until the end of the current creature's turn.
