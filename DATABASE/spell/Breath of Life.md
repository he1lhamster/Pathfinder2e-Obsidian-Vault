Your blessing revives a creature at the moment of its death. You prevent the target from dying and restore Hit Points to the target equal to 4d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You can't use _breath of life_ if the triggering effect was [[DATABASE/spell/Disintegrate|disintegrate]] or a death effect.
