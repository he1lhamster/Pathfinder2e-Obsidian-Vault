Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]]. This makes it [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to them instead. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile action is completed.

---
**Heightened (4th)** The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn't end if the target uses a hostile action.
