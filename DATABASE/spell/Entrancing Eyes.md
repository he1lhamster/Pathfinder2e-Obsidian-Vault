Your eyes glow with an entrancing radiance that captivates those who meet your gaze. Any creature that ends its turn within the emanation must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and becomes immune to this particular casting of the spell.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 2]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]].
**Critical Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is stupefied 4, fascinated, and can't take reactions. In addition, all creatures and objects other than you are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] from the target.
During any round you Sustain the Spell, you can use a single action, which has the manipulate trait, to focus your entrancing eyes on a single creature you can see within 30 feet. This creature must immediately make a Will save against the spell as if it were ending its turn in the emanation. If the creature was already fascinated by your entrancing eyes before its save, a failed save causes it to be [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round. You can’t use this action to focus on the same creature more than once per round.
