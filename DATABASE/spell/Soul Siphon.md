You siphon off a portion of the target's soul to bolster your own vitality. The target must attempt a Fortitude save or take 1d4 negative damage. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the total amount of HP the target loses, including the HP lost from becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]].
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes drained 1.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and becomes drained 2.

---
**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 1d4.
