With a twist of a finger, you send a creature careening on a haphazard trajectory. The target must attempt a Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes a –2 status penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] checks.
**Failure** As success, and each time the target Strides, it uses the first 5 feet of movement of the Stride to move 5 feet in a random direction (this is forced movement). This has no effect on a creature with only 5 feet of movement.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except you control the direction of the target's first 5 feet of movement of the Stride.
