You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes:

* **Weal** The results will be good. 
* **Woe** The results will be bad. 
* **Weal and Woe** The results will be a mix of good and bad. 
* **Nothing** There won't be particularly good or bad results.

The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always “nothing.” This makes it impossible to tell whether a “nothing” result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of _augury_ during an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result.
