You send the target's mind and body into overdrive, forcing it to become restless and hyperactive. During the duration, the target must Stride, [[Fly]], or [[Swim]] at least once each turn or take 2d8 mental damage that turn; The GM might decide to add additional move actions to the list for creatures who possess only a more unusual form of movement. The duration of this effect depends on the target's Will save.
**Critical Success** The spell has no effect.
**Success** The duration is 1 round.
**Failure** The duration is 2 rounds.
