You wrap the target in purifying flames. You can attempt to counteract a single poison or non-curse effect imparting the [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy]], [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]], [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] condition. The target can choose to empower the flames with their life force, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] (or increasing their drained value by 1, if already under the condition) to grant you a +1 circumstance bonus to your counteract check.
