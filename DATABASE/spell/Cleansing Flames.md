You wrap the target in purifying flames. You can attempt to counteract a single poison or non-curse effect imparting the [[Clumsy]], [[Dazzled]], [[Enfeebled]], [[Fatigued]], [[Frightened]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Sickened]], or [[Stupefied]] condition. The target can choose to empower the flames with their life force, becoming [[Drained]] (or increasing their drained value by 1, if already under the condition) to grant you a +1 circumstance bonus to your counteract check.
