# Fungal Infestation<span class="item-type">Spell 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Conjuration</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]]

**Cast** <span class="action-icon">2</span> somatic, verbal
**Range** touch; **Area** 15-foot cone
**Saving Throw** Fortitude

Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal 2d6 [[Persistent Damage]], and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half the persistent poison damage.
**Failure** The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but double the persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.

---
**Heightened (+2)** The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
