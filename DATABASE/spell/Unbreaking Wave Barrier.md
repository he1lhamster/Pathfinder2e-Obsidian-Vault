You create a protective circle around yourself that repels your foes. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC. Any creature other than you within the area, or attempting to move into the area, must attempt a Fortitude saving throw; a creature needs to attempt the Fortitude saving throw only once each round. If a creature pushed by _unbreaking wave barrier_ would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every additional 5 feet it would've been pushed. On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain this Spell each round, you can increase the radius of the barrier by 5 feet.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature isn't pushed, but the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.
**Failure** The creature is pushed 10 feet, and the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.
**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet and knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]], and the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.
