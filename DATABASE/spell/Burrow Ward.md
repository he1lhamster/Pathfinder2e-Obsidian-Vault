You solidify the earth around you, hindering burrowing creatures. Creatures that can't burrow through stone can't burrow through the area. Such creatures already underground within the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be ejected from the area toward the surface. Those who succeed are forced out of the area but can remain underground. Creatures that can burrow through stone treat the area as difficult terrain.

**Heightened (5th)** You create a 30-foot emanation.
