Your form ripples as you take on the fluidity and toxicity of quicksilver. You partially shift into a liquid metal form and Stride up to twice your speed. During this movement, you can pass through one creature's space—without needing to attempt a check to [[DATABASE/action/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]]—by splitting into droplets of mercury and reforming on the other side, though you can't end your turn in such a space. Passing through a creature's space in this way exposes it to mercury poisoning, with a Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]].
**Failure** The target becomes sickened 2 and takes 6d6 poison damage.
**Critical Failure** The target becomes sickened 2 and takes 12d6 poison damage.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 on a failure and 2d6 on a critical failure.
