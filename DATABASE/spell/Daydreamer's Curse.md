You impose a curse upon the target that renders it easily distracted and unable to focus its thoughts on tasks that demand insight or discernment. The target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a [[Medicine]], [[Nature]], Perception, or [[Survival]] check. If the target critically succeeds at a Perception check or skill check to perform an action with the concentrate trait, the target gets a success instead.
**Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target treats the outcomes of all checks with the concentrate trait as one degree of success worse than the result it rolled (a critical success becomes a success, a success becomes a failure, and a failure becomes a critical failure).
