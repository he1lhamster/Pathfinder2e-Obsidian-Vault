You forcefully and cruelly draw the living breath from a creature's lungs, dealing 4d8 bludgeoning damage. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage. For the duration, the creature must hold its breath or suffocate.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, and all the air is pulled from the creature's lungs. The creature falls [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] and starts suffocating for the duration.
