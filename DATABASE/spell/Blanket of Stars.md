A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] and [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]]. While outside under a starry night sky, you're also [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] as long as you remain still. When moving under a starry night sky, you are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] instead.
 Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this is a mental, visual effect.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the end of its next turn.
**Critical Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] and dazzled until the end of its next turn.
