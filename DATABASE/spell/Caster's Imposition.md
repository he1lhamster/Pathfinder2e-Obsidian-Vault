A magical interference prevents the target from contributing to any form of cooperative spellcasting. On a failed save, the target can't participate in any ritual unless they can cast the ritual alone, and they can't access any spells provided by a [[DATABASE/monsterability/Coven|coven]] or similar cooperative ability.
