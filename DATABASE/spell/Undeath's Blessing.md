You instill within a creature the touch of the grave. For the duration, [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, _harm_ spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target.
 If the target wishes to avoid the spell, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the effects.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target heals half as much from _heal_ and takes half as much damage from _harm_ for 1 round.
**Failure** Effects as described in the text.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The status bonus to the Hit Points restored increases by 2.
