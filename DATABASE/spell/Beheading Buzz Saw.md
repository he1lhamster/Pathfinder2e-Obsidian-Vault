You compress molten scraps pulled from the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Metal|Plane of Metal]] into a spinning disc with gruesome blades protruding from its edges. It wheels forward, slicing through anyone in its path. Each creature in the area takes 5d10 slashing damage and 4d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]], with a Reflex save.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage. If the creature has a head, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or be decapitated; this kills any creature except ones that don't require a head to live. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head. This second save has the death and incapacitation traits.

**Heightened (+1)** The slashing damage increases by 1d10, and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1d6.
