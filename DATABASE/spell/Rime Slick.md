You call down a chill wind. When you Cast this Spell, you deal 2d4 cold damage to each creature in the area (basic Reflex save). If a creature in the area critically fails its Reflex save and was standing, it also falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
 You also create a layer of ice on all surfaces in the area, which become difficult terrain. Unattended objects in the area become slick with ice, and picking them up requires a successful Reflex save or [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check against your spell DC. The ice melts on any object that takes fire damage as well as in any square included in the area of a higher-level spell or effect with the fire trait.
