You attempt to seize control of the target. It can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If the target is already being [[Controlled]] by another creature, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw and the undead uses the better result. Casting _subjugate undead_ again ends any previous _subjugate undead_ you cast.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The undead creature becomes a minion under your control for 1 minute. The spell is dismissed if you or an ally takes a hostile action against the minion undead.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 10 minutes.
