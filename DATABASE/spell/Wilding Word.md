With a few words, you convince a wild creature you are a kindred spirit, making it reluctant to harm you. The target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** When the target attempts an attack roll or skill check that would harm you, it takes a –2 status penalty to its roll.
**Failure** As success, but the target also becomes [[Sickened]] each time it damages you.
**Critical Failure** As success, but the target also becomes sickened 2 each time it damages you.
