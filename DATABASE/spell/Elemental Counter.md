Each element in the elemental cycle counters another, and you can use your elemental spells to protect against elements they counter. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell, using the rank of the spell you lost for the counteract rank. You can lose a plant or wood spell to counter earth, an earth spell to counter water, a water spell to counter fire, a fire spell to counter metal, or a metal spell to counter plant or wood.
