You consume and ingest fire, making it less harmful to you. You gain resistance 5 to fire damage until the end of the current turn. During the remaining duration of the spell, you can use the Belch Smoke action. The spell ends if you fall [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], inhale, or exhale (this includes speaking).
 **Belch Smoke** <span class="action-icon">1</span> You exhale what remains of the smoke, ending the spell and creating a smoke cloud in a 5-foot burst within 20 feet. All creatures within the smoke cloud are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.
