You shout in defiance, filling you with a sudden burst of healing. Just before applying the attack's damage, you recover 10d4+20 Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become unconscious or dying. Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use _hero's defiance_ again until you Refocus or the next time you prepare. _Hero's defiance_ cannot be used against effects with the death trait or that would leave no remains, such as [[DATABASE/spell/Disintegrate|disintegrate]].
