You heat a foe's blood and boil it within its veins. The target takes 10d10 fire damage, with a Fortitude save. A nonliving creature with blood in its body (such as a vampire) can be affected, but a creature with no blood is immune.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage.
**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]].
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is drained 3.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10.
