You hurl a bolt of saltwater from your extended hand. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range.
**Critical Success** The creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round and [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 minute as saltwater sprays into its eyes. The creature can spend an Interact action to rub its eyes and end the blinded condition, but not the dazzled condition.
**Success** The creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is blinded for 1 round. The creature can spend an Interact action wiping the salt water from its eyes to end the blinded condition.
