The target visually senses the heat energy emitted by the creatures and objects around it, gaining infrared vision at a range of 60 feet as a precise sense. This vision can detect any warm-blooded creature or source of heat not completely covered behind a solid object, such as a wall; this bypasses any [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealement]] granted by smoke or darkness. It can similarly detect especially cold creatures and sources of cold. Almost all creatures with the cold or fire trait can be detected with _heatvision_. Undead and constructs are typically the same temperature as their environment and can't be detected with _heatvision_. The GM decides in other cases.

**Heightened (6th)** The duration lasts until you next make your daily preparations, and the range increases to 120 feet.
