You draw an occluding veil of spirits around yourself, blocking yourself especially well from undead eyes. You become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] to all creatures, and you are [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from undead creatures regardless of what precise senses they have; this grants the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Invisibility|invisibility]], but against all the undead creature's precise senses. If you physically interact with an undead creature or use a hostile action, the spell ends.

**Heightened (+1)** You can target one additional willing creature within 30 feet. The spell ends if any target physically interacts with an undead creature or uses a hostile action
