You curse the target, sapping its spirit and leaving a contagious trap in its essence. The target must attempt a Will save. Any creature that casts a divine or occult spell on the target while it's affected is targeted by _spiritual epidemic_ and must also attempt a Will save. The curse continues to spread in this way.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is enfeebled 2 and stupefied 2 for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is enfeebled 2 and stupefied 2 for 1 minute and enfeebled 1 and stupefied 1 permanently.
**Critical Failure** The target is enfeebled 3 and stupefied 3 for 1 minute and enfeebled 2 and stupefied 2 permanently.
