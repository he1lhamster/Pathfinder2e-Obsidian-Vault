You attempt to wrest control of a target undead or force it to recognize you as its master. If the target is controlled by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] as it fights off your commands.
**Failure** The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]] by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and the spell ends on a success. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature.
