You bathe yourself in a mantle of liquid metal, gilding your skin and armor with an oily sheen. Upon Casting this Spell, pick two of the options below. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.

* **Copper Core** You draw electricity toward you, then disperse it. You gain resistance 10 to electricity. All electricity effects within 30 feet of you must succeed at a counteract check against your spell DC or target you and only you.
* **Golden Flesh** Your body gains the chemical inertness of gold, barely reacting to substances that would otherwise greatly disturb your physiology. You become immune to poison and disease and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks against any poison and disease effects currently affecting you.
* **Reactive Touch** Your touch reacts easily with other metals. Any metal that touches you or that you touch takes 2d6 acid damage that bypasses Hardness.
* **Weighted Grasp** Your arms become long cables, your fists heavy as anchors. You gain a cabled fist unarmed attack with the disarm, finesse, reach, and trip traits and that's in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Flail|flail]] group. Your cabled fist deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 1d6 poison damage and [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grab]].
