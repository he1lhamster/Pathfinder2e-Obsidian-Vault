You coat a creature's body in a layer of brilliantly sparkling glitter. The target gains a +2 status bonus on [[Deception]] checks to [[Create a Diversion]] and to [[Feint]], and on [[Performance]] checks to [[Perform]] that have the visual trait. When the target take damage, glitter bursts out of its wound in a 5-foot emanation. Creatures in the area must attempt a Fortitude save.
**Failure** The creature is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** The creature is dazzled for 3 rounds.
