You discorporate into a swarm of Tiny creatures. While in swarm form, you have the swarm trait and you gain resistance 5 to slashing and piercing damage and weakness 5 to area and splash damage. You can fit into spaces only a few inches wide, moving your constituent creatures through the gap. You don’t gain the swarm mind ability, so you are still affected normally by mental effects. As a swarm, you can’t speak, cast spells, use manipulate actions requiring your hands, activate your magic items, or make any of your Strikes with your normal body. You can Dismiss the Spell.
