You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, turning it into a goodberry that can heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A creature can eat the goodberry with an Interact action to regain 1d6+4 Hit Points. A berry not consumed during the duration withers away. Every six goodberries consumed gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.

**Heightened (+1)** You can target an additional berry. A creature can consume any number of goodberries from the same casting with a single Interact action.
