You inflict despair on creatures in the area. The effects for each creature are determined by its Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** For 1 round, the creature can't use reactions and must attempt another save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it is slowed 1 for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.
**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is automatically slowed 1 for 1 minute.

**Heightened (7th)** The area increases to a 60-foot cone.
