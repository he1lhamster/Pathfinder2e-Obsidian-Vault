You pray for swift and painful death to your enemies and find your and your allies' weapons blessed to deliver just that. The target weapons are coated with [[DATABASE/equipment/Giant Scorpion Venom|giant scorpion venom]] with a DC equal to your spell DC. The effects remain on a weapon for 1 minute or until the weapon deals damage, whichever comes first.
