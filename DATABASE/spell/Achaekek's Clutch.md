You mark the holy symbol of [[Achaekek]] in a visible location on the target's body.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is marked by Achaekek's symbol. For 1 minute, the first time per round that the target gains [[Persistent Damage]], they immediately take that amount of slashing damage as the mantis claws grow off the symbol and rake them.
**Failure** As success, but the curse has an unlimited duration.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the DC on the target's flat check to remove persistent bleed damage increases to 20 (15 with particularly effective assistance).
