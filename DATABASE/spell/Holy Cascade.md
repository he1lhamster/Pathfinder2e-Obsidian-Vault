You call upon sacred energy to amplify a vial of _holy water_, tossing it an incredible distance. It explodes in an enormous burst that deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area from the cascade of water. The water deals an additional 6d6 positive damage to undead and 6d6 good damage to fiends.
