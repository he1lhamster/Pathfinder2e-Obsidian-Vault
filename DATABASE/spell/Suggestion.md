Your honeyed words are difficult for creatures to resist. You suggest a course of action to the target, which must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target and can't be self-destructive or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.
**Success** The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.
**Failure** The target immediately follows your suggestion. The spell has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the base duration is 1 hour.

**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
