You ward the target item against those who would steal it. When a creature attempts to take the target into its possession, it takes 8d8 mental damage and is [[Doomed]], depending on the result of its Will save. The spell then ends. You can choose up to 10 creatures when you cast this spell; if you do, those creatures can take the target item without triggering the ward. You can only have one _bandit's doom_ active at a time. If you cast the spell again, the newer casting supersedes the older.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage and is doomed 1.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is doomed 2.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is doomed 3.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 2d8.
