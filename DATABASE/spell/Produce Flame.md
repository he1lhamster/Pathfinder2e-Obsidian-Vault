A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and you lash out with it either in melee or at range. Make a spell attack roll against your target's AC. This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against a creature in your unarmed reach. The flame deals fire damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
**Critical Success** The target takes double damage and 1d4 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]].
**Success** The target takes full damage.

---
**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 1d4 and the persistent damage on a critical hit by 1d4.
