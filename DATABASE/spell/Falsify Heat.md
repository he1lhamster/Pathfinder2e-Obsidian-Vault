You veil the signs of the fires of vitality, altering the target's apparent body temperature. This illusion applies to all senses, and a creature that touches the target can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. You can Dismiss the spell. Choose an illusory body temperature when you cast the spell.

* **Moderate** The target's body temperature appears the same as the surrounding environment, giving the target a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] an undead, a cold-blooded creature, or an inanimate object (such as a corpse). The target is also invisible to [[DATABASE/spell/Heatvision|heatvision]] and other abilities that sense heat similarly.
* **Warm** The target appears to emit substantial body heat, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate a warm-blooded creature.
