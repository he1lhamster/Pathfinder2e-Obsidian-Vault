Vines and branches envelop you in an instant, growing a wild bloom of colors that open to reveal your new form. Upon Casting this Spell, pick two of the options below. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.

* **Evergreen Vitality** You gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing 3]] and a +2 bonus to saves against poison and disease. This effect has the healing and vitality traits.
* **Overwhelming Perfume** (aura, olfactory) A cloud of potent floral scent surrounds you in a 15-foot emanation. Creatures in the aura can't benefit from the scent ability and are [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] as long as they remain in the aura. The sickness is a disease effect.
* **Towering Trunk** You grow to a considerable height. Increase your size to Large. You're [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]]. Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a grasping branch unarmed attack; this attack is in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] weapon group and deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grab]].
* **Unyielding Will** Your mind becomes incredibly resilient to change. You're immune to being [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]], and you get a +1 bonus to saves and DCs against mental effects.
