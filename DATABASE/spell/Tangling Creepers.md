Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, or [[Climb]] or [[Swim]] within the creepers, takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This vine has a 15-foot reach. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target; on a success, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it [[Immobilized]] for 1 round or until the creature [[Escape]] (against your spell DC), whichever comes first.
