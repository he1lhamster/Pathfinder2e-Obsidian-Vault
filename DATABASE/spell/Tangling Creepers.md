Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, or [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climbing]] or [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swimming]] within the creepers, takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This vine has a 15-foot reach. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target; on a success, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] for 1 round or until the creature [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]] (against your spell DC), whichever comes first.
