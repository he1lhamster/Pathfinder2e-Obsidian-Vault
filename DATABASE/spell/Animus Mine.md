You implant a mental mine within your psyche that detonates against anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts. You can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to suppress the effects of the mine for 1 round to allow someone to safely use a mental effect on you. You can Dismiss the spell.
 The first creature that uses a magical mental effect against you triggers the _animus mine_, causing the spell to end. The _animus mine_ deals 4d8 mental damage to the triggering creature, which must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is stunned 1. You are unaffected by the triggering mental effect.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d8.
