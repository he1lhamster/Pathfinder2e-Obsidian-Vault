Your body becomes insubstantial as you partially phase out. You gain resistance 2 to all damage (except force).

---
**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 1.

---
**Amp** Your insubstantiality is complete enough that you can pass through other creatures, causing painful interference effects when you do so. Once each round when you Stride, [[DATABASE/action/Burrow|Burrow]], [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]], or [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]], you can pass through one creature's space during that action without needing to attempt a check to [[DATABASE/action/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]], though you can't end your turn in its space. When you pass through a creature's space in this way, you deal 2d6 force damage to that creature, with a basic Fortitude save.
**Amp Heightened (+2)** Increase the damage dealt by phasing through a creature by 1d6.
