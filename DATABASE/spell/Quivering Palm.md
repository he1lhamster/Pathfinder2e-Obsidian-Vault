Make a melee unarmed Strike. If you hit and the target is alive, anytime during the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.
If you cast _quivering palm_ again, the effects of any _quivering palm_ you had previously cast end.
**Critical Success** The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Success** The target is stunned 1 and takes 40 damage, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Failure** The target is stunned 3 and takes 80 damage. The spell's duration continues, but the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours against being killed by _quivering palm_.
**Critical Failure** The target dies.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 10 on a failure, or 5 on a success.
