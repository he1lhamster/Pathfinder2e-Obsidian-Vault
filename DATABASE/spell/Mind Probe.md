You cast your thoughts through a creature's mind, sifting for information. You access the target's memories and knowledge unless it fends you off with a Will save.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** Each round of the spell's duration, you can Sustain the Spell to ask a different question and attempt to uncover the answer. For each question, the target can attempt a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe is truthful Once you've asked the target a given question, asking it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe, produces the same result.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target takes a –4 circumstance penalty to Deception checks against your questions.
