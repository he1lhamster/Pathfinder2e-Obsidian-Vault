You call upon your patron's power to better uncover secrets. When you Cast the Spell, the target can [[Recall Knowledge]], [[Seek]], or [[Sense Motive]]. The target gains a +1 status bonus to the skill or Perception used for the roll, and this bonus remains as long as you Sustain the Spell. The target is temporarily immune to _discern secrets_ for 1 minute.

**Heightened (5th)** You can target two creatures instead of one.
