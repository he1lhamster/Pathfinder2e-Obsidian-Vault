By suddenly altering gravity, you pull the target toward you. The target is pulled 10 feet closer to you unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. On a critical failure, it's also knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. The effects of this spell change depending on the number of actions you spend when you Cast this Spell.
