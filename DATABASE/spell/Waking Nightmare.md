You fill the creature's mind with a terrifying vision out of its nightmares. The target must attempt a Will save.
 If the target is unconscious when you Cast this Spell on it, it immediately wakes up before attempting its save, and if it fails its save, it gains the fleeing condition for 1 round in addition to the effects noted below.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is frightened 1.
**Failure** The target is frightened 2.
**Critical Failure** The target is frightened 3.
