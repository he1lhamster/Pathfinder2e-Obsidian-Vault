### Secrets of Magic

* **Agmazar the Star Titan ** Speed 100 feet, climb 50 feet; **Arrive** (necromancy, negative) _Channel Void_ Each foe in a 100-foot emanation takes 16d8 negative energy damage with a basic Fortitude save; **Depart** (transmutation) _Gravitic Repulsion_ Each foe in a 50-foot emanation is pushed 100 feet away unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.
* **Agyra, the Forever Storm ** Speed 80 feet, fly 200 feet; **Arrive** (electricity, evocation) _Breath of a Thousand Storms_ Agyra shoots two 1,200-foot lines of electricity, one from each of her heads. The lines can't overlap. Each creature along one of the lines takes 6d12 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the creature is also [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round (or for 1 minute on a critical failure); **Depart** (evocation, sonic) _Thunderous Blast_ Each creature within a 100-foot emanation takes 6d10 sonic damage with a basic Reflex save, and is also knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] on a failed save.
* **Bezravnis, the Inferno Below ** Speed 100 feet, burrow 100 feet; **Arrive** (earth, evocation) _Burrow from the Earth's Heart_ Bezravnis explodes from the ground where it was summoned, causing all creatures in a 50-foot emanation to take 8d12 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. This potentially collapses structures with the collapse effect of the [[DATABASE/spell/Earthquake|earthquake]] spell, except there is no chance of falling into a fissure; **Depart** _Web Hurricane_ Bezravnis departs with a hurricane of webbing. All creatures within a 50-foot emanation must succeed at a Reflex save or take a –20-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]] (or is [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] until it escapes on a critical failure). The Escape DC is your spell DC.
* **Mogaru, the Final King ** Speed 100 feet, swim 100 feet; **Arrive** (auditory, enchantment, mental) _Trance of the King's Melody_ Mogaru manifests with a burst of the song that summoned him, requiring all foes within 60 feet who can hear him to attempt a Will save, leaving them [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 3]] on a failure; **Depart** (evocation, fire) _Volcanic Breath_ Mogaru unleashes his scorching breath in a 120-foot cone. Each creature in the area takes 10d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, it also takes 4d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]].
* **Vorgozen, the Shapeless Feeder ** Speed 50 feet, climb 50 feet, swim 100 feet; **Arrive** (necromancy) _Pollute Magic_ Vorgozen's foul presence pollutes magic around her. Each of your enemies within a 60-foot emanation that are under the effects of a spell must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 2]]. Any of your enemies that Casts a Spell within 60 feet of Vorgozen must attempt a Fortitude save with the same effects unless it's already sickened; **Depart** (acid, evocation) _Beam of Purest Vitriol_ Each creature in a 1,200-foot line takes 10d6 acid damage and 10d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save.
* **Yarthoon, the Moon Grub** Speed 60 feet, burrow 100 feet, fly 100 feet, swim 100 feet; **Arrive** (cold, evocation) _Algid Beam Barrage_ Yarthoon fires countless beams, targeting each of your enemies within 200 feet of it. The beams deal 10d6 cold damage with a basic Reflex save; **Depart** (cold, conjuration, water) _Frostbite Mist_ Chilling mist surges out in a 100-foot burst centered on Yarthoon and remains for 1 minute. This mist has the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]], plus any creature within the area at the end of its turn take 5d6 cold damage with a basic Fortitude save.
