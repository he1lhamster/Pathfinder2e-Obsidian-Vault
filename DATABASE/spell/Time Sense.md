When you Cast the Spell, you gain a perfect sense of time. You can learn exactly what time it is, down to the second. You can instead choose to gain a perfect sense of the calendar if you have knowledge in that area—if you're trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]], you can learn exactly how long it is until sunrise and how many days until the next solstice. If you're trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Astronomy Lore]], you can learn precisely when any known predictable astronomical conjunction will begin and end, and so on.
 You can gain a +1 status bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check you take on the same turn you cast _time sense_ that requires extremely precise timing. If you choose to gain this bonus, you can't gain it again for 1 hour.
