Holding your weapon aloft, you fill it with divine energy. On your next Strike with that weapon before the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll and the weapon deals an additional die of damage. If the weapon has a _striking_ rune, this instead increases the number of dice from the _striking_ rune by 1 (to a maximum of 3 extra weapon dice).
If the target weapon leaves your possession, _weapon surge_ immediately ends.
