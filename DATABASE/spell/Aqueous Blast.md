You evoke a mass of water into the air around your outstretched fist. For the remainder of your turn, you can blast targets within 30 feet with this water by spending a single action which has the attack and concentrate traits. When you do so, attempt a ranged spell attack roll. If you hit, you inflict 2d8 bludgeoning damage. On a critical hit, the blast knocks the target [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d8.
