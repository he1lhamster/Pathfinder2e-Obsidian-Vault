You shroud one creature in a cloak of fierce, howling winds, shielding it from attacks and making it difficult to approach. The twisting shield of wind creates difficult terrain in a 5-foot burst surrounding the target. The target also gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against physical ranged attacks, such as attacks made with [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Bow|bow]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Javelin|javelin]], or [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Sling|sling]]. In addition, the sound of the swirling storms makes it easier for the target to ignore anything it doesn't want to hear, granting the target a +2 circumstance bonus to all defenses against auditory effects.
