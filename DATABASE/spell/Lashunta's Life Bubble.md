You create a replenishing protective bubble of fresh, temperate air around the target. The shell of air enables the target to breathe even underwater or in a vacuum, protects from severe cold and heat, and grants a +1 status bonus to the target's saves against inhaled dangers such as inhaled poisons and [[Cloudkill]].

**Heightened (6th)** The bubble lasts until your next preparation.
**Heightened (8th)** The bubble lasts until your next preparation, protects against extreme cold and heat, and grants a +2 status bonus instead of +1.
