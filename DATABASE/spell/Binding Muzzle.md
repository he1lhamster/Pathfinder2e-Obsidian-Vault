A shimmering muzzle of pure magical force clamps the target's mouth shut. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to resist the muzzle. For targets with more than one mouth, the caster must target a single mouth.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** For 1 round, the target can't use jaws Strikes, Breath Weapons, or any other attack that originates from the mouth, nor can they imbibe anything, including potions, mutagens, and elixirs.
**Failure** As success, but the effect lasts 1 minute, and they must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to Cast a Spell with verbal components.
**Critical Failure** As success, but the effect lasts 1 minute and the target can't speak.
