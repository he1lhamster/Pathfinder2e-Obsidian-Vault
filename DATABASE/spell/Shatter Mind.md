---
You telepathically assail the minds of your foes. You deal mental damage equal to 2d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier to all enemies in the area, with a basic Will save.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.

---
**Amp** You increase the area of the spell to your choice of a 30-foot cone or 60-foot cone, and the damage dice for the spell change to d10s. Creatures that fail are [[Stupefied]] until the start of your next turn (or stupefied 2 on a critical failure).
