A swirling torrent of water manifests along a straight line, battering creatures and unattended objects in its path and possibly pushing them away from you. The torrent deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic Fortitude save; unattended objects automatically fail. Creatures and objects that fail the save are also knocked back 5 feet (10 feet on a critical failure).

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
