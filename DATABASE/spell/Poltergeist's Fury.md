Your fury spills over in a telekinetic storm of terrifying proportions. Any loose, unattended objects of 1 Bulk or less within range are picked up and begin to orbit you at breathtaking speeds. All creatures in the area take 6d4 piercing damage with a basic Reflex save. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can increase the radius of the storm by 10 feet, to a maximum of 100 feet. The storm moves with you and provides you with lesser cover, though you can't use this cover to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]]. Allies within the storm who roll a success on their Reflex save against your poltergeist's fury get a critical success instead, as you attempt to avoid hitting them.
