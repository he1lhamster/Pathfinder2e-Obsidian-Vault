Your touch afflicts the target with Abyssal plague, which siphons fragments of their soul away to empower the Abyss. The effect is based on the target's Fortitude save.
**Abyssal Plague** (disease); **Level** 9. The target can't recover from the drained condition from Abyssal plague until the disease is cured. **Stage 1** drained 1 (1 day); **Stage 2** drained increases by 2 (1 day).
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes 2 evil damage per spell level, and takes a –2 status penalty to saves against Abyssal plague for 1 day or until the target contracts it, whichever comes first.
**Failure** The target is afflicted with Abyssal plague at stage 1.
**Critical Failure** The target is afflicted with Abyssal plague at stage 2.
