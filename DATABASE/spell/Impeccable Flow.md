You attune yourself to an underlying cosmic order to the world. While you remain in tune with this power, you gain a +1 status bonus to Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you critically fail any check while under the effects of this spell, the bonus ends and you instead have a –1 status penalty to all checks for the remaining duration.
