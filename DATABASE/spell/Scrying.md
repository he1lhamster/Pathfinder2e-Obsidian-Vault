You magically spy on a creature of your choice. _Scrying_ works like [[DATABASE/spell/Clairvoyance|clairvoyance]], except that the image you receive is less precise, insufficient for [[DATABASE/spell/Teleport|teleport]] and similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, _scrying_'s DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.
 The effect of _scrying_ depends on the target's Will save.
**Critical Success** The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you.
**Success** The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.
**Failure** The spell succeeds.
**Critical Failure** The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round.
