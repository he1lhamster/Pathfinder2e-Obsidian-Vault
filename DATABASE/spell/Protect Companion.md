**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
**Traditions** arcane, divine, occult, primal
**Cast** <span class="action-icon">1</span> verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** your eidolon, or a creature with the minion trait under your control
**Duration** until the start of your next turn

You extend your aura, as a magical shield that protects your eidolon or minion. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. You gain the following reaction; after using the reaction, the spell ends and you can't cast _protect companion_ again for 10 minutes.
 **Life Block** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The spell's target would take damage; **Effect** Reduce the triggering damage by 10, but you lose 5 Hit Points. Even if this reduces the damage to 0, the target still takes any effects that would come with the damage, such as the poison on a viper's fangs Strike.

---
**Heightened (+2)** The reaction reduces the damage by another 10, and you lose 5 more Hit Points. If you want to lose fewer Hit Points, you can choose to lower the damage reduction and HP lost to what any lower-level version of the spell could do without lowering the spell's actual level.
