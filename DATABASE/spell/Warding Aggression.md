You channel a magical ward through your attack and attempt to plant it on a foe. This ward increases your defenses against that foe, as long as you keep attacking that foe to maintain it. Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack against a foe. In addition to the normal effects of the Strike, it has the effects below. _Warding aggression_ ends if the foe you attacked dies or at the end of any turn in which you didn't hit that foe with a melee Strike.
**Critical Success** You gain a +3 status bonus to AC against the foe for 1 round and a +2 status bonus to AC against the foe for the remaining duration.
**Success** You gain a +2 status bonus to AC against the foe.
**Failure** You gain a +1 status bonus to AC against the foe.
**Critical Failure** You gain no additional effect.
