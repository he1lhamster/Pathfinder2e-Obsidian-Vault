A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouth— words so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your diatribe. Your words deal 2d6 [[Persistent Damage]], and the target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn't understand the language or you're not speaking a language, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half the persistent fire damage.
**Failure** The target becomes [[Frightened]] and takes the full persistent fire damage.
**Critical Failure** The target becomes frightened 2 and takes double the persistent fire damage.

---
**Heightened (+2)** You can target two additional creatures, and the persistent damage increases by 2d6.
