You channel negative energy to harm the living or heal the undead. If the target is a living creature, you deal 1d8 negative damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. If the target is a willing undead creature, you restore that amount of Hit Points. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.
 <span class="action-icon">1</span> **(somatic)** The spell has a range of touch.
 <span class="action-icon">2</span> **(somatic, verbal)** The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing an undead creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.
 <span class="action-icon">3</span> **(material, somatic, verbal)** You disperse negative energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the area.

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
