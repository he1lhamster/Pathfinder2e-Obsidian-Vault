You summon an isolated blizzard of obscuring, scouring ice to follow your target. The target attempts a Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes 1d6 cold damage, and the spell ends.
**Failure** The target takes 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent cold damage]]. (The persistent damage automatically ends when the spell ends.) It is [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] to other creatures, and other creatures are concealed to it.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but both the cold damage and the persistent cold damage increase to 2d6.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage and persistent cold damage increase by 1 (2 on a critical failure).
