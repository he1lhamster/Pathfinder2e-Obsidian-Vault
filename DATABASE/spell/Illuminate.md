You light all non-magical light sources in the area that use fire to provide their light—such as candles, lamps, and sconces. You can choose to make the emanation smaller than its maximum, to any distance of your choice. If a light source is attended by an unwilling creature, that creature can attempt a Reflex save to snuff the light out before it becomes noticeable.
