The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the air in a vertical cylinder, dealing 14d6 fire damage to creatures in the area. The lava rapidly cools and encases creatures in the area. A creature encased in rock is clumsy 1 and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to a flying creature, and such creatures immediately descend 20 feet the moment they're encased, but they don't take damage from this fall. A creature encased in rock can attempt to Escape against your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwise, the creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock.
 Additionally, creatures in the area and those within 5 feet of the lava column automatically take 3d6 fire damage from the intense heat, regardless of the results of their saving throws.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is encased.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is encased.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage in the area increases by 2d6, and the damage from the intense heat increases by 1d6.
