You turn the target's flesh slowly into wood. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. Creatures with the plant trait have a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against this spell.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[Slowed]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from _lignify_, the creature is permanently non-magically [[Petrified]], though it's turned to wood instead of stone. The spell ends if the creature is magically petrified or the slowed condition is removed.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2.
