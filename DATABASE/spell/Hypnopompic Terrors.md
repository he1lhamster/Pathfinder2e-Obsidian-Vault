You send a wave of nightmarish visions crashing over your targets, leaving them paralyzed by fear. These visions inflict real wounds on vulnerable targets, dealing 6d12 mental damage. If you target a sleeping creature, it wakes up as it attempts the save but takes one degree of success worse than the result it rolled on its save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 2]] and takes half the mental damage.
**Failure** The target is frightened 2, is [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round, and takes the full mental damage.
**Critical Failure** The target is frightened 2, is paralyzed for 2 rounds, and takes double the mental damage.
