You encircle yourself in an aura of protective flames. Each creature that hits you with an unarmed attack, [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapples]] you, or otherwise touches you takes 3 fire damage. When you Cast the Spell and the first time you sustain it each round, each creature in the area takes 3d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save).
