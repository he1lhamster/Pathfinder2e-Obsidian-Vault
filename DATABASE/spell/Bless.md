Blessings from beyond help your companions strike true. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls while within the emanation. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast _bless_, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. _Bless_ can counteract [[DATABASE/spell/Bane|bane]].
