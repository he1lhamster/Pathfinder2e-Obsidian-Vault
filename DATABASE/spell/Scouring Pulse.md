You inundate the area with concentrated positive energy, which scours away the stain of undeath. Each creature in the area takes 6d8 positive damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. Creatures that fail the save also take 1d8 [[Persistent Damage]]. Creatures that take persistent positive damage from _scouring pulse_ are wreathed in a heatless halo of light. They emit bright light in a 5-foot radius preventing them from being [[Concealed]]; if the creature is [[Invisible]], they're concealed while affected by scouring pulse, rather than being [[Undetected]].

**Heightened (8th)** The positive damage increases to 9d8 damage, and the persistent positive damage increases to 2d8. Creatures remain suffused in light for 1d4 additional rounds after removing the persistent positive damage.
