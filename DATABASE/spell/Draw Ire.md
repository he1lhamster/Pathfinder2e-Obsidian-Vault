You cause mental distress to a creature, goading it to strike back at you. You deal 1d10 mental damage to the creature and cause it to take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you. The creature must attempt a Will saving throw.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage and the penalty. The spell ends at the end of the target's next turn.
**Failure** The target takes full damage and the penalty.
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, and the status penalty is –2.
