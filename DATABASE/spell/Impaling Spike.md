You conjure a spike that thrusts up from the earth beneath a target creature, potentially impaling it. The spike is made of [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron|cold iron]] and deals 8d6 piercing damage. The target must attempt a Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The target dodges the spike and is unaffected.
**Success** The target is struck by the spike and takes half damage.
**Failure** The target is impaled through a leg or another non-vital body part. The creature takes full damage and, if it's standing on solid ground, becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]]. It can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] (the DC is your spell DC). While it remains impaled, it takes damage from any weakness to cold iron it has at the end of each of its turns.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is impaled through a vital organ or its center of mass, taking double damage, and it is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] as long as it's impaled.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
