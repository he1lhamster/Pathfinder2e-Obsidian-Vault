You surround a foe in a swirling storm of violent winds, roiling clouds, and crackling lightning. The storm deals 1d12 electricity damage. The target must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the target also is clumsy 2 for 1 round and takes 1 persistent electricity damage.

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by 1d12, and the persistent electricity damage on a failure increases by 1.
