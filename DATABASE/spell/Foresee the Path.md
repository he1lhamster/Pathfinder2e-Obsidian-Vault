You see just a split second into the future and glean how an enemy will move, making it easier for your allies to strike it mid-action. Make a Perception check against the target enemy's Will DC or [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] DC, whichever is higher. The GM may judge a different DC is more appropriate if it's higher; for instance, using the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Warfare Lore]] DC of a military captain. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Critical Success** The target ally gains a reaction that lets it make a melee Strike against the target enemy, triggered if the enemy leaves a square within the ally's reach. If the ally already has an ability that lets it make melee Strikes as a reaction, such as [[DATABASE/monsterability/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]], the ally can forgo gaining the temporary reaction to instead gain a +2 status bonus to melee Strikes it makes as reactions.
**Success** As critical success, but the status bonus an ally gets if it forgoes the reaction is +1.
**Failure** The spell has no effect.

**Amp** The spell has the same result on a failure as on a success (but still no effect on a critical failure). Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can choose an additional ally to target, granting them the same benefit as the initial target ally
