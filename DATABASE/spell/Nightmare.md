**Success** The target experiences the nightmares but suffers no adverse effects other than unpleasant memories.
**Failure** The target experiences the nightmares and awakens fatigued.
**Critical Failure** The target experiences the nightmares, awakens fatigued, and is drained 2 until it is no longer fatigued.
