You fill the minds of your enemies with doubt. Enemies in the area must succeed at a Will save or take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls as long as they are in the area. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast _bane_, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet and force enemies in the area that weren't yet affected to attempt another saving throw. _Bane_ can counteract [[DATABASE/spell/Bless|bless]].
