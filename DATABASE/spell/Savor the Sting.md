You inflict pain upon the target and revel in their anguish. This deals 1d4 mental damage and 1d4 persistent mental damage; the target must attempt a Will save. As long as the target is taking persistent damage from this spell, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks against the target.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage and no persistent damage.
**Failure** The target takes full initial and persistent damage.
**Critical Failure** The target takes double initial and persistent damage.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by 1d4 and the persistent damage increases by 1d4.
