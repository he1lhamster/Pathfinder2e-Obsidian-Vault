You summon a layer of clear glass to keep you from harm. This cantrip functions as the [[Shield]] spell, except it has Hardness 2 and 4 Hit Points. If this shield breaks, provided the breaker is within 5 feet, they must succeed at a basic Reflex save or take 1d4 piercing damage from the glass shards.
