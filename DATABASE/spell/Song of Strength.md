You bolster your allies' physical strength with a hearty exhortation. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks and to their DCs against Athletics skill actions such as [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]], [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]], and [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]].
