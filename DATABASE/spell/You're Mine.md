You manipulate the target's emotions, potentially allowing you to control it for a brief instant. The target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is stunned 1.
**Failure** On the target's next turn, it's stunned 1 and you partially control it, causing it to take a single action of your choice. If it has actions left, it can act normally.
**Critical Failure** The target is controlled for 1 round.

---
**Heightened (7th)** On a failure, the target is controlled for 1 round. On a critical failure, the target is controlled for up to 1 minute; it receives a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, the spell ends.
