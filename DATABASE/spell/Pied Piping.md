Your performance enraptures those who hear it, compelling them to follow you about in admiration. Each creature within the emanation must attempt a Will save when you Cast the Spell or the first time they enter the area, after which they become temporarily immune for 1 day. Once per turn, you can spend a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. You can Dismiss the spell.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] with you.
**Failure** The creature uses all its actions to move toward you and compliment your performance. This effect ends if a hostile action is used against the affected creature.
**Critical Failure** The target gains the minion trait and is controlled by you. This effect ends if a hostile action is used against the affected creature, or if you direct the creature to use any action that causes it harm.
