The target's clothes are transformed into ostentatious attire that epitomizes high-end local fashion. No details of the target's appearance transform other than their clothes, so their weapons or armor remain unchanged in appearance. The target gains a +1 status bonus on [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Create a Diversion|Make a Distraction]]. You can Dismiss this spell. At the end of the spell's duration, the target's clothes revert to their original appearance.
