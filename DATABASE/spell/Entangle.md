Plants and fungi in the area entangle creatures. The area counts as difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also immobilized for 1 round. Creatures can attempt to Escape at _entangle_'s DC to remove these effects.
