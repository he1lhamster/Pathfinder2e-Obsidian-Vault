You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:

* Duplicate any spell from the occult list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
* Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.
* Produce any effect whose power is equivalent to any occult spell 9th level or lower, or non-occult spell 7th level or lower. 
* Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]] spell

At the GM's discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.
