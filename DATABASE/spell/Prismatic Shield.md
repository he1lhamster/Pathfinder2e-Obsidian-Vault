Shield-sized shards of multicolored light manifest in the air around you, each rotating quickly to intercept attacks. Melee attacks against you impact a randomly colored shard, subjecting the attacker to a random effect from [[Prismatic Spray]], with a saving throw of the type indicated in that spell. The shards automatically block physical ranged attacks the size of a [[Spear]] or smaller, such as [[Arrows]], [[Bolts]], and [[Javelin]]. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against attacks with larger ranged weapons. Any spell that targets you requires the caster to succeed at a counteract check against your spell DC, or it fails to affect you.
