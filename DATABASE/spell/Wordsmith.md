You're a devotee of knowledge with an unmatched command of the language used to spread that knowledge, and you can reshape the written word into a form more understandable to your audience. The language of the target's written text shifts to a language you know. This shift doesn't change the text's contents beyond minor translation differences, nor does it grant the reader any understanding of the original language.
