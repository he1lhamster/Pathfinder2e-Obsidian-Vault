The racoon-like visage of a sagacious [[Procyal (Raccoon Agathion)]] appears, dispensing helpful advice. The image appears floating next to the target. The image is just a floating magical manifestation and doesn't occupy any space. The procyal offers helpful suggestions, preparing to [[Aid]] the target as though the procyal had its own reaction. The procyal uses a bonus equal to your spell DC – 10 for its rolls to Aid.
 On each of your turns, the procyal prepares to Aid its target again. You can use a free action, which has the concentrate trait, to redirect the procyal image to a different creature, changing the target of the spell. Otherwise, the procyal keeps aiding the same creature for the duration of the spell.
