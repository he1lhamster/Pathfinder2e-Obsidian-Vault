A thin layer of ash and flame covers the ground in the area. The area becomes hazardous terrain. A creature that moves on the ground through the area takes 1 fire damage for every square of that area it moves into. A creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]].
 Each time you Sustain this spell, the radius of the burst increases by 5 feet.
