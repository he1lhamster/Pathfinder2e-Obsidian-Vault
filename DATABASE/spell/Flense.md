With a touch, you strip off the flesh, muscle, and internal organs off your target, leaving only bare bones. The effect depends on whether the target is a living creature, undead creature, or inanimate corpse. A creature or corpse that lacks flesh, muscle, and internal organs is immune to this spell.

* **Inanimate Corpse** The flesh, muscle, viscera, and organs are stripped from the corpse and vanish, leaving only bare bones behind.
* **Living Creature** Make a spell attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage. On a critical hit, double the damage, and the target also takes 1d4 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]. If this spell's damage kills the target, the corpse is only bones.
* **Undead Creature** Make a spell attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage. On a critical hit, double the damage, and the target also becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute. If this spell's damage destroys the target, only its bare bones remain behind.
