You ward a creature against the effects of a single spell. Choose a spell and name it aloud as part of the verbal component. _Spell immunity_ attempts to counteract that spell whenever _spell immunity_'s target is the target of the named spell or in that spell's area. Successfully counteracting a spell that targets an area or multiple targets with spell immunity negates the effects only for the target affected by _spell immunity_.
