You channel the primal forces of nature to transform into a Large battle form, specifically that of a powerful and terrifying [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elephant|elephant]] or similar creature, such as a mammoth, mastodon, or anancus. This spell has the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Dinosaur Form|dinosaur form]], except you gain the following specific abilities instead of the form-specific abilities of _dinosaur form_.
 **Speed** 40 feet; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> foot, **Damage** 2d8 bludgeoning; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> trunk (reach 10 feet), **Effect** grabbing trunk; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> tusk (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d6 piercing.
 **Grabbing Trunk** A creature up to two sizes smaller that's hit by your trunk is [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]]. If you succeed at your [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] check against a creature grabbed by your trunk, you can reposition the creature to another space within your trunk's reach.
