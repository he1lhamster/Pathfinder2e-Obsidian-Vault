You grant the target properties of dull, transparent glass. The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], has no scent, and can't bleed. They gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, and piercing damage and weakness 5 to sonic and bludgeoning damage. A creature in this form is affected by the [[DATABASE/spell/Shatter|shatter]] spell as though the creature were an unattended object. Each time the target takes damage to which the spell grants resistance or weakness, reduce the duration by 1 minute.

**Heightened (+2)** The resistances and weaknesses increase by 5.
