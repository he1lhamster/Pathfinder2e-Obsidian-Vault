You grind a chunk of your choice of metal to fine dust between your hands and blow it into the air, where it grows into a tangle of wires covered in razor-sharp prongs. The metal must be of a type you currently have in your possession. The covered area is difficult terrain. A creature that moves through the area takes 5 slashing damage per square traversed.
 If a creature takes slashing, piercing, or [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] while inside the thicket, you can spend a reaction to grow the iron in the shed blood into additional wires, expanding the burst by 5 feet. You can grow the area four times in this way, to a maximum of a 40-foot burst. 
The barbed wires are made of the metal you chose and activate resistances, weaknesses, and the like normally. The metal reforms in your possession when the spell ends.
