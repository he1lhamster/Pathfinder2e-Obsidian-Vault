You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you Cast the Spell takes 1d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. All creatures in the area become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and all creatures outside the smoke become concealed to creatures within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.
