# Noxious Vapors<span class="item-type">Spell 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Evocation</span><span class="item-trait">Poison</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Traditions** arcane, primal
**Cast** <span class="action-icon">2</span> somatic, verbal
**Area** 10-foot emanation
**Saving Throw** basic Fortitude; **Duration** 1 round

---
You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you Cast the Spell takes 1d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes [[Sickened]]. All creatures in the area become [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the smoke become concealed to creatures within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
