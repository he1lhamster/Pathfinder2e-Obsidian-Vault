You create an area of bright light. Creatures with [[Light Blindness]] that are [[Blinded]] by radiant field and remain in the area must attempt a Fortitude save at the start of their turns. On a failure, a creature remains blinded for 1 round; this is an incapacitation effect. This spell also suppresses magical darkness of your _radiant field_ spell's level or lower.

**Heightened (4th)** Creatures seen through the area are [[Concealed]] to creatures with light blindness, even those that are outside the area.
