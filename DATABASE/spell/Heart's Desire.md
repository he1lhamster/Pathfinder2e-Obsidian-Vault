You surround your target with wondrous illusions of their greatest desires, which distract them from reality. The target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target disbelieves the illusion and is unaffected.
**Success** For 1 round, the target is [[Stupefied]] and takes a –2 status penalty to any checks it makes to determine the effects of reactions.
**Failure** For 1 minute, the target is stupefied 2 and can't use reactions.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and all spaces are difficult terrain for the target.

**Heightened (+2)** You can target one additional creature.
