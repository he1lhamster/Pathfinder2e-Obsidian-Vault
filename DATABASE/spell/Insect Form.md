You envision a simple bug and transform into a Medium animal battle form. When you cast this spell, choose ant, beetle, centipede, mantis, scorpion, or spider. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss this spell.
 You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

* AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction. 
* 10 temporary Hit Points. 
* Low-light vision. 
* One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +13, and your damage bonus is +2. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]] condition). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead. 
* [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] modifier of +13, unless your own is higher.
