You become aware of vibrations in the ground around you. You gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Tremorsense|tremorsense]] as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet. As normal for tremorsense, you can detect a creature only if it's on the same surface as you and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface.
