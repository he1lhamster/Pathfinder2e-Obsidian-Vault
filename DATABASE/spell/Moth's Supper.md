You sigh, and your breath transforms into delicate, black-winged butterflies and huge death's-head hawkmoths. They flutter about you briefly, and then range forth in search of sustenance— fresh-spilled blood, by preference, but rotting corpses, flowering plants, or even left-behind food will do in a pinch. They then return, perching on your hair or shoulders and whispering their secrets into your ears. This has three effects.

* You heal 2d4 Hit Points every 10 minutes.
* The first time during the duration when someone successfully [[Treat Wounds]], you regain an additional 4d4 Hit Points.
* You gain an imprecise sense out to 30 feet that senses only freshly spilled blood and rotten flesh.
