You conjure a celestial to fight on your behalf. This works like [[DATABASE/spell/Summon Animal|summon animal]], except you summon a common creature that has the celestial trait and whose level is 5 or lower, such as those below. You can't summon a creature unless its alignment is one of your deity's preferred alignments (or, if you don't have a deity, is within one step of your alignment). At the GM's discretion, some deities might restrict specific types of celestials, even if their alignments match.
