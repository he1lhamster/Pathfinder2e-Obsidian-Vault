You focus on the intricacies of the magic binding you to your eidolon to extend the duration of your [[DATABASE/spell/Boost Eidolon|boost eidolon]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Reinforce Eidolon|reinforce eidolon]] spell. If your next action is to cast _boost eidolon_ or _reinforce eidolon_, attempt a skill check with the skill associated with the tradition of magic you gain from your eidolon (such as [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] for a primal eidolon). The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.
**Critical Success** The spell lasts 4 rounds.
**Success** The spell lasts 3 rounds.
**Failure** The spell lasts 1 round, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.
