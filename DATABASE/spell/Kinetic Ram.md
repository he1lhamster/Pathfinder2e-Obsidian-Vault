Gathering kinetic energy, you either focus it in a straight line or disperse it as an encircling ripple. Any creature targeted by this spell must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you (or 20 feet on a critical failure). The spell's area or range and how many creatures it affects is based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.

* <span class="action-icon">1</span> The spell targets one creature within 15 feet.
* <span class="action-icon">2</span> The spell targets one creature within 30 feet. The distance the target is pushed if it fails is doubled, and on a critical failure, the target is also knocked prone and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
* <span class="action-icon">3</span> The spell targets all creatures in a 5-foot emanation.
