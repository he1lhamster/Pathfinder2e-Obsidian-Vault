Your deity blesses base metals to transform them into precious materials. The target item transforms from its normal metal into [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron|cold iron]], copper, gold, iron, [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver|silver]], or steel. An item transmuted in this way deals damage according to its new material. For example, a steel sword transmuted to cold iron would deal additional damage to a creature with a weakness to cold iron.
 This change is clearly magical and temporary, so the item's monetary value doesn't change; you couldn't transmute copper coins to gold and use those coins to purchase something or as a cost for a spell.

**Heightened (8th)** Add [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine|adamantine]] and [[DATABASE/equipment/Mithral|mithral]] to the list of metals you can transform the item into.
