You infuse the air around you with a sustained hum that allows creatures within it to resist distractions. The DC of any flat check to Cast a Spell while [[Stupefied]] for creatures within the area is 2 lower. [[Confused]] creatures in the area don't attack anyone, including themselves, and instead lose the ability to speak coherently. You take a –2 penalty to [[Stealth]] checks to [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]].
