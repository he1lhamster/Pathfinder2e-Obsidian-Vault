You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide to your allies with your [[Inspire Courage]] or [[Inspire Defense]] composition. If your next action is to cast _inspire courage_ or _inspire defense_, attempt a Performance check. The DC is usually a very hard DC of a level equal to that of the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your _inspire courage_ or _inspire defense_ composition depends on the result of your check.
**Critical Success** The status bonus from your _inspire courage_ or _inspire defense_ increases to +3.
**Success** The status bonus from _inspire courage_ or _inspire defense_ increases to +2.
**Failure** Your _inspire courage_ or _inspire defense_ provides only its normal bonus of +1, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.
