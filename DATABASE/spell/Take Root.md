Roots sprout from the flesh of the target and coil across the floor or around objects, reinforcing their stance or grip. The targeted creature gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude DC against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] them and a +1 circumstance bonus to their Reflex DC against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] them. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that would attempt to remove a held item from their grasp.
