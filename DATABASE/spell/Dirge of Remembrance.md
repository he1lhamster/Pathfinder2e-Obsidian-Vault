You sing a funereal dirge to force restless spirits to fully manifest in the [[Material Plane]]. Each incorporeal creature in the area takes 4d10 sonic damage (this damage bypasses its resistances) depending on the result of its Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes semi-corporeal until the spell ends. All attacks against it get the benefit of a [[Ghost Touch]] rune.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but double damage.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10.
