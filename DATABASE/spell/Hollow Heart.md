You stoke the target's ambition beyond reason, until it believes no one is capable of helping it, or that others aren't to be trusted. The target attempts a Will saving throw.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target treats no other creature as an ally for 1 round. 
**Failure** The target treats no other creature as an ally for 3 rounds.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]] as it realizes it can't rely on anyone but itself.
