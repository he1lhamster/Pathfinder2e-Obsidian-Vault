You call forth three illusory images of yourself, and each of the four of you takes on a different color, your colors all shifting each time someone attacks you. This has the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Mirror Image|mirror image]], except that whenever a foe destroys one of the images, roll 1d4 to see which color the image was when it was destroyed. The attacker takes the corresponding effect.

1. **Red** 5 fire damage and 5 mental damage.
2. **Orange** 5 acid damage and 5 mental damage.
3. **Yellow** 5 electricity damage and 5 mental damage.
4. **Green** 5 poison damage and 5 mental damage, plus it's [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]].
