You shroud the target in a powerful predatory aura and amplify its vocalizations. It gains a +1 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks. Once during this spell's duration, it can take the Thundering Roar action.
 **Thundering Roar** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, concentrate, emotion, enchantment, fear, flourish, mental, sonic) The target unleashes a powerful vocalization. Each enemy in a 10- foot emanation takes 4d8 sonic damage with a basic Will save against your spell DC. A creature that fails its Will save is also [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]].

**Heightened (+2)** The status bonus to Intimidation checks increases by 1 (to a maximum of a +4 status bonus for an 8th-level spell), and the damage from the roar increases by 2d8.
