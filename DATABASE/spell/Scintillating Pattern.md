A field of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern, as are those within 20 feet of the pattern's area. A creature must attempt a Will save if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds.
**Critical Failure** The creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds. After the stunned condition ends, the creature is confused for the remaining duration of the spell.
