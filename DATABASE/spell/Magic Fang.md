Choose one of the target's unarmed attacks. You cause that unarmed attack to shine with primal energy. The unarmed attack becomes a _+1 [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]]_ unarmed attack, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the number of damage dice to two if it had only one.
