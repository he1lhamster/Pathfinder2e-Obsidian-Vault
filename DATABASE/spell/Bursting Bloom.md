You cause a rose bush to sprout from the chest of a foe, bursting out of its body and wrapping it in thorned vines. The target takes 6d6 piercing damage and 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] and must attempt a Fortitude save. When the target is no longer taking persistent bleed damage and is no longer [[DATABASE/condition/Encumbered|encumbered]], the rose bush withers away to nothing.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage and no persistent damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and persistent damage and is encumbered for 4 rounds.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and persistent damage and is encumbered for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 3d6, and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1d6.
