You inhale all air in the surrounding area, stealing the breath of nearby creatures. During vacuum's duration, you take a –1 circumstance penalty against inhaled threats, such as inhaled poisons. If you cast _vacuum_ in an environment where you can't breathe, the spell fails and you immediately begin to suffocate. Creatures in the area must attempt a Fortitude save. A creature that's holding its breath gets a result one degree of success better than it rolled, and creatures that don't need to breathe air are immune to the spell. A creature that later enters the area or ceases holding its breath must attempt a save against the effect. On subsequent rounds, the first time each round you Sustain the spell, you can force each creature in the area to save against the effect.
**Success** The creature begins holding its breath.
**Failure** The creature wheezes and gasps as its breath is stolen, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]]. The creature then begins holding its breath but has only half its normal number of rounds of remaining air.
**Critical Failure** The creature has all the air sucked out from its lungs and immediately starts to suffocate.
