You surround yourself in a veil of confidence. You reduce your current frightened condition by 1, and whenever you would become frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you critically fail a save against fear, _veil of confidence_ ends immediately, and you increase any frightened condition you gain from the critical failure by 1 instead of decreasing it.
