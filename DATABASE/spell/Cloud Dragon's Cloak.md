A cloud of mist enshrouds the target, appearing much like the deflecting clouds created by cloud dragons. The target is treated as [[Hidden]] for the purposes of resolving the triggering attack (so normally the attacker must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to target it) and all ranged attacks against it for the duration.
