You probe the target's mind to glean knowledge. This deals 1d8 mental damage with a basic Will save. If the target fails the save, you sort through the stolen memories to attempt a single check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]. Choose a skill that has the Recall Knowledge action, and use the target's skill modifier for the check.

**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 1d8.
