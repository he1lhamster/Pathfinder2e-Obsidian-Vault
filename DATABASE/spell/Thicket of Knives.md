You create numerous phantom copies of your weapon arm, hiding your true movements and rendering your attacks unpredictable. You gain a +2 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks. If you're untrained in Deception, you can use the [[DATABASE/action/Feint|Feint]] action anyway, and add your level as your proficiency bonus despite being untrained.
