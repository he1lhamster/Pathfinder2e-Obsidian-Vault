You infuse a creature's vision with darkness. After attempting its save, the target becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target's darkvision or low-light vision is suppressed for 1 round.
**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute, and the target is also [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for the duration. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns. If it succeeds, it's no longer blinded, but its darkvision or low-light vision remains suppressed.
