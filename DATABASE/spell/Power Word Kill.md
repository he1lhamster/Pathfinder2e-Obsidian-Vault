You utter the most powerful arcane word of power. Once targeted, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level. 
**14th or Lower** The target dies instantly. 
**15th** If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes dying 1, or increases its dying condition by 1 if it's already dying. 
**16th or Higher** The target takes 50 damage; if this brings the target to 0 Hit Points, the target dies instantly.

---
**Heightened (10th)** The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2.
