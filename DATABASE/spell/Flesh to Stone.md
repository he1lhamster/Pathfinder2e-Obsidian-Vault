You try to turn the target's flesh into stone. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from _flesh to stone_, the creature is permanently non-magically [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]]. The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2.
