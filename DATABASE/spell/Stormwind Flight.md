Powerful winds carry you smoothly through the air, giving you a fly Speed equal to your Speed. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as [[DATABASE/spell/Feather Fall|feather fall]].

**Heightened (6th)** When you fly using _stormwind flight_, you don't count flying against the wind as difficult terrain.
