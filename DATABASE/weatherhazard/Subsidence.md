**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Survival** DC 22 (expert)
**Description** With little warning, the ground itself suddenly gives way, be it a caused by a small avalanche, rockslide, mudslide, or the sudden opening of a sinkhole.

---
**Prepare** DC 22 Perception to take a less dangerous path through the region.
**Routine** A subsidence has no duration. Those who aren't prepared when it occurs attempt a DC 22 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The character avoids the unexpected subsidence entirely.
**Success** The character takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage from the subsidence.
**Failure** The character takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage from the subsidence. If the subsidence is a sinkhole, the character ends up at the bottom of a hole 1d6 × 5 feet down and can clamber out with a successful DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check. If the subsidence is a mudslide, rockslide, or avalanche, the character is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] and swept 200 feet away.
**Critical Failure** The character takes 16d6 bludgeoning damage from the subsidence and is buried. Buried PCs are at risk of suffocation; see Burial for details on how a buried creature can be rescued.

---
**Major Subsidence** (12th) Increase DCs associated with the subsidence to 32, and bludgeoning damage increases to 8d6 for a successful save, 16d6 for a failed save, and 32d6 for a critical failure.
