**Prepare** DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] (trained) or DC 21 Perception to realize that small showers of hail that have been dropping in the region will soon give way to severe hail.
**Routine** (1+ hours) During a severe hailstorm, periodic flurries of hail measuring an inch or more in diameter buffet the area. Any character who doesn't have shelter during a severe hailstorm takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 18 basic Reflex save) over the course of the hour. A severe hailstorm also limits vision in the same manner as heavy downpour.
