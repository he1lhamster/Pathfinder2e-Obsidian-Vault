# Windstorm<span class="item-type">Hazard 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Weather</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Survival** DC 19 (expert)
**Description** High winds wreak havoc and disrupt travel, and they may even cause damage as trees or other objects are blown over.

---
**Prepare** DC 19 [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] (expert) or DC 16 [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] to know how and where to find shelter from the upcoming storm.
**Routine** (24+ hours) As long as the windstorm persists, the effects of wind on movement are in effect. Overland travel in a windstorm is treated as if moving through difficult terrain. Once every 8 hours, attempt a DC 18 flat check; on a success, a randomly chosen PC who isn't sheltered is struck by debris.
 **Debris Strike** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The targeted PC takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 16 basic Reflex save).
