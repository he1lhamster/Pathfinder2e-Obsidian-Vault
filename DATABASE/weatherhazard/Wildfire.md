**Survival** DC 22 (trained)
**Description** A fire spreads through the region, be it one accidentally started by a poorly maintained campfire, deliberate arson, a lightning strike, or from a supernatural source like a creature's fiery breath or a fire spell being cast by a bandit in the region. Wildfires cannot occur during [[Heavy Downpour]] or [[Blizzard]], and if such an event starts in the area, it brings an existing wildfire to an end.

**Prepare** DC 18 [[Survival]] (trained) or DC 25 Perception to notice plumes of smoke or the tang of smoke in the air.
**Routine** (1+ hour) An unsheltered character must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or take 6d6 fire damage (12d6 fire damage on a critical failure). If the character has sheltered in a temporary shelter or a flammable building, attempt a DC 16 flat check each hour the fire persists; on a failure, the fire consumes the shelter.

**Severe Wildfire** (10th) A severe wildfire has a duration of 8+ hours. Unsheltered characters must succeed at a DC 29 Reflex save or take 12d6 fire damage (24d6 fire damage on a critical failure), and it's a DC 11 flat check for the temporary or flammable shelter to avoid burning. The heavy smoke in the area is thick enough to function as fog.
