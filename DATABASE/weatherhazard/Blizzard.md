**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Requirements** A blizzard can occur only during winter.
**Survival** DC 25 (expert)
**Description** A combination of heavy snowfall and wind reduces visibility and temperature significantly.

---
**Prepare** DC 21 [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] (trained) to notice escalations in the weather or 25 DC [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] (expert) to correctly interpret the behavior of local wildlife.
**Routine** (8+ hours) For the blizzard's duration, visibility is reduced to such an extent that visual Perception checks have a –4 circumstance penalty. Windstorm conditions (page 125) apply during a blizzard, and the regional temperature drops to severe cold. Once a blizzard starts, an unsheltered character takes 2d6 cold damage every hour. During a blizzard, a DC 25 Survival check is enough to find or create shelter to avoid additional cold damage from exposure, but each attempt to do so takes 1 hour. Once a blizzard ends, travel through the zone is treated as difficult terrain for a number of days equal to the number of flat checks that were required to end the blizzard.
