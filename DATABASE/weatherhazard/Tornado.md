<span class="item-trait">Weather</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Requirements** The PCs are in a hex that contains no significant hills or mountains.
**Survival** DC 27 (expert)
**Description** Strangely colored or ominously shaped clouds often presage the arrival of a distinctive funnel cloud's arrival in the region.

---
**Prepare** DC 35 [[Survival]] (master) to know how best to prepare for the tornado if no existing shelters are available.
**Routine** (1+ hours) When a tornado touches down, the funnel cloud can wreak amazing damage. While the area affected by a tornado is relatively limited, predicting where the tornado will travel during its brief, destructive lifetime is difficult. Underground chambers can provide shelter from tornadoes, but characters who seek shelter above ground are still in danger. Each hour that a tornado persists in the area, attempt a DC 16 flat check (for each PC sheltering above ground) or a DC 6 flat check (for each PC who isn't sheltered at all). On a success, that PC is exposed to the tornado's winds or its hurled debris and must attempt a DC 32 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The character avoids the tornado and its debris.
**Success** The character takes 4d6 bludgeoning and 4d6 piercing damage from hurled debris, but they avoid further damage from that particular tornado for the remainder of the hour.
**Failure** The character takes 8d6 bludgeoning and 8d6 piercing damage from hurled debris, and they must save against the tornado's effects again on the following round.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the character is also lifted into the air and hurled 120 feet in a random direction, taking an additional 60 points of bludgeoning damage from the fall.

**Tornado Swarm** (17th) The most devastating of these storms involve multiple tornadoes touching down at once. In a tornado swarm, the Survival DC increases to 34, the Prepare DC to 43, and the save DC against the tornado's effects to 38. Additionally, each hour that the tornado swarm persists in the area, make four flat checks for each PC, potentially exposing a PC to many more tornado saving throws in an hour.
