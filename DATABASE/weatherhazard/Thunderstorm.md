<span class="item-trait">Weather</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Survival** DC 27 (expert)
**Description** Dark clouds announce their arrival with distant peals of thunder and flashes of lightning.

---
**Prepare** DC 23 [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] (trained) to minimize chances of being struck by lightning.
**Routine** (8+ hours) A thunderstorm functions as a [[DATABASE/weatherhazard/Heavy Downpour|heavy downpour]] during its duration, but with the added danger of being struck by lightning. If the PCs prepare for a thunderstorm, they can avoid lightning strikes and still travel by taking the [[DATABASE/action/Defend|Defend]] exploration activity (taking care to move carefully, staying low, and avoiding trees and the like rather than raising shields). A PC who travels without taking this activity or doesn't seek shelter must attempt a DC 6 flat check each hour; on a failure, that PC is struck by lightning and takes 8d8 electricity damage (DC 25 basic Reflex save).

**Severe Thunderstorm** (13th) A severe thunderstorm's Survival DC increases to 37 and its Prepare DC to 32. A PC at risk of being struck by lightning must attempt a DC 10 flat check 1d4 times each hour and is struck by lightning on each failure for 14d8 electricity damage (DC 33 basic Reflex save).
