**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Survival** DC 16
**Description** The clouds above darken, and a significant amount of precipitation unloads over the region.

---
**Routine** (24+ hours) Rain or snow continues to fall all day, making those caught out in the elements cold and wet. As long as the heavy downpour lasts, visual Perception checks take a –1 circumstance penalty, causes creatures that are further than 100 feet away to be concealed, and cuts off all visibility at half a mile or more.
 During a heavy downpour, other storms tend to be even more severe. The DC of skill checks made to survive, prepare, or endure the routine of a blizzard, severe hailstorm, supernatural storm, thunderstorm, or windstorm increase by +2 during heavy downpour. Rivers tend to rise during heavy downpours. Shallow points to cross rivers become too deep to ford and remain so for 1d4 days after the event.
