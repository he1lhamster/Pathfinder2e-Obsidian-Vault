This broad-bladed sword, sometimes called the hand-and-a-half sword, has a longer grip so it can be held in one hand or used with two hands to provide extra slashing power.

## Traits

**Two-Hand 1d12:**

This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from _[[Striking]]_ runes.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Sword**: The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of your next turn.

## Specific Magic Weapons

[[Briar]], [[Crimson Brand]], [[Gearblade]], [[Serithtial]]
