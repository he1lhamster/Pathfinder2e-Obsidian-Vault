These L-shaped fighting batons are good for striking and blocking. The wielder holds the handle and either spins the stick or strikes with the stick covering the forearm.

## Traits

**Agile:**

The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Finesse:**

You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.

**Monk:**

Abilities with this trait are from the [[DATABASE/class_/Monk|monk]] class. A weapon with this trait is primarily used by monks.

**Parry:**

This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend a single action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

**Twin:**

These weapons are used as a pair, complementing each other. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don’t need to have the same runes.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Brawling**: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] until the end of your next turn.
