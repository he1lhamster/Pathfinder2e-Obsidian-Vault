This slender, rapier-like sword is concealed within a wooden or metal cane that serves as a sheath, making it an inconspicuous weapon easy to slip past inspections or into high-society events. A sword cane is typically 4 feet long when sheathed, and its hilt is usually capped with a wooden or metal decoration.

## Traits

**Agile:**

The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Concealable:**

This weapon is designed to be inconspicuous or easily concealed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks and DCs to hide or conceal a weapon with this trait.

**Finesse:**

You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Sword**: The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of your next turn.
