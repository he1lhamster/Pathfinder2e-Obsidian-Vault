## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Bow**: If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Water|water elemental]] or some [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ooze|oozes]]), or could otherwise escape without effort.
