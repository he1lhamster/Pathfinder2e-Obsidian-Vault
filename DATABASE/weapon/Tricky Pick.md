This ingenious [[Kobold]] pick conceals several hidden traps, which the wielder can activate to trick and befuddle foes with a variety of damaging blades and bludgeoning surfaces.

## Traits

**Backstabber:**

When you hit a [[Flat-Footed]] creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if the weapon is a _+3 weapon_.

**Fatal 1d10:**

The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Kobold:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the kobold ancestry. Kobolds are reptilian humanoids who are usually Small and typically have [[Darkvision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by kobolds.

**Modular (B, P, or S):**

The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s description to list more complicated configurations.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Pick**: The weapon viciously pierces the target, who takes 2 additional damage per weapon damage die.
