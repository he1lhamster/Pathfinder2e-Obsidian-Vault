The cast-iron frying pan is an essential tool for adventuring [[DATABASE/ancestry/Halfling|halflings]], gold panners, and remote tavern owners. Characters with the [[DATABASE/feat/Halfling Weapon Familiarity|Halfling Weapon Familiarity]] ancestry feat are trained in the frying pan.

## Traits

**Fatal d8:**

The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Halfling:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the [[DATABASE/ancestry/Halfling|halfling]] ancestry. These small people are friendly wanderers considered to be lucky. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by halflings. A weapon with this trait is created and used by halflings.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Club**: You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is forced movement.
