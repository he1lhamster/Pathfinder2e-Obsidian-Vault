## Traits

**Ranged Trip:**

This weapon can be used to [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] with the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] skill at a distance up to the weapon's first range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn't deal any damage when used to Trip. This trait usually appears only on a thrown weapon.

**Tethered:**

This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand (including if you've just thrown a two-handed tethered weapon and have a hand holding nothing but the weapon's tether), you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed (unless it is being held by another creature).

**Thrown 20 feet:**

You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon’s Range entry.

**Trip:**

You can use this weapon to [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] with the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Club**: You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is forced movement.
