# Rotary Bow

<span class="item-trait">Capacity 4</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Price** 8 gp; **Damage** 1d8 P; **Bulk** 1
**Hands** 1; **Range** 80 ft.; **Reload** 1
**Type** Ranged; **Category** Martial; **Group** [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Bow|Bow]]
**Ammunition** [[DATABASE/weapon/Bolts|Bolts]]

This one-handed crossbow has four arms instead of two, and four rotating chambers that can be pre-loaded with bolts for more efficient firing. The chamber can be swapped and the arms redrawn with a simple crank device built into the crossbow.

## Traits

**Capacity 4:**

Weapons that have the capacity trait typically have multiple barrels or chambers capable of containing a bolt or round of ammunition. Capacity is always accompanied by a number indicating the number of barrels or chambers. After a capacity weapon is fired, you can select the next loaded barrel or chamber as an Interact action that doesn't require a free hand. You can use abilities that let or require you to Interact to reload to switch barrels or chambers of a capacity weapon instead. Each barrel or chamber can be individually reloaded after it's fired as a separate Interact action.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Bow**: If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Water|water elemental]] or some [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ooze|oozes]]), or could otherwise escape without effort.
