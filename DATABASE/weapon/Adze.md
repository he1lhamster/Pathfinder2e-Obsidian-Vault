A common cutting tool, an adze resembles an axe—but the cutting edge is horizontal, rather than vertical. The adze's shape makes it popular among wood workers, and [[Grippli]] builders often use them to construct their treetop homes. The tool also serves as an effective weapon, due in part to the immense strength required to swing it.

## Traits

**Forceful:**

This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.

**Grippli:**

Gripplis are a family of frog-like humanoids. Gripplis craft and use these weapons.

**Sweep:**

This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Axe**: Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its _[[Striking]]_ rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
