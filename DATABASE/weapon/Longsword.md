Longswords can be one-edged or two‑edged swords. Their blades are heavy and they’re between 3 and 4 feet in length.

## Traits

**Versatile P:**

A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Sword**: The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of your next turn.
