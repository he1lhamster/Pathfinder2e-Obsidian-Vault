## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Dart**: The target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]]. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
