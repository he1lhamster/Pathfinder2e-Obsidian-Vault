This specialized club is designed for throwing and is useful for both combat and hunting. Rungus were invented by Zenj humans of the Mwangi Expanse and are most common among their tribes, though [[DATABASE/ancestry/Grippli|gripplis]] have also adopted rungus for hunting creatures that hide high in treetops.

## Traits

**Grippli:**

Gripplis are a family of frog-like humanoids. Gripplis craft and use these weapons.

**Shove:**

You can use this weapon to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] with the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**Thrown 30 ft.:**

You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon’s Range entry.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Club**: You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is forced movement.
