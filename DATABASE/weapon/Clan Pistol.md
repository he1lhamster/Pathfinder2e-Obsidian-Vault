The tradition of [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarves]] displaying their clan affiliations with special [[DATABASE/weapon/Clan Dagger|clan daggers]] goes back millennia, but many of the dwarf clans of Dongun Hold have their own take on the tradition, with promising young gunsmiths claiming their adulthood by crafting a specialized personal firearm using the clan's unique smithing traditions. Losing or being forced to surrender their clan pistol is a terrible embarrassment for the dwarves that carry them.

## Traits

**Concussive:**

These weapons smash as much as puncture. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.

**Dwarf:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the dwarf ancestry. Dwarves are stout folk who often live underground and typically have [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by dwarves. An item with this trait is created and used by dwarves.

**Fatal d10:**

The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Firearm**: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
