No one's entirely certain who developed the spoon gun, but all authorities agree that it was probably a goblin. Essentially a terrible idea in firearm form, the spoon gun is a spring-powered [[DATABASE/weapon/Hand Cannon|hand cannon]] with a modified grip that uses miscellaneous knives, forks, chopsticks, and spoons as ammunition. Users typically upend the entire contents of their cutlery drawer into the gun, aim it in the general direction of the foe, and hope it hits something.
 This hand cannon is a martial weapon, instead of a simple weapon. It has the scatter (5 feet) trait and uses cutlery or similar-sized objects as ammunition instead of bullets (enough cheap cutlery to fire ten shots costs 1 sp). 
Big boom guns and spoon guns are modified versions of hand cannons with potential benefits and drawbacks alike, rather than separate weapons. If you have access to the spoon gun or big boom gun modifications, you can purchase them whenever you would purchase a hand cannon, and effects that depend upon and apply to hand cannons apply to both weapons.

## Traits

**Cobbled:**

This firearm is cobbled together and likely to misfire. No matter how well you upkeep it, on a failed attack roll, the attack misses and you must roll a DC 5 flat check. If you fail this check, the weapon misfires.

**Goblin:**

A creature with this trait can be one of several kinds of creature, including [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblins]], [[DATABASE/ancestry/Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]], and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Bugbear|bugbears]]. Goblins tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins. A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.

**Modular B, P, or S:**

The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s description to list more complicated configurations.

**Scatter 5 ft.:**

This weapon fires a cluster of pellets in a wide spray. Scatter always has an area listed with it, indicating the radius of the spray. On a hit, the primary target of attacks with a scatter weapon take the listed damage, and the target and all other creatures within the listed radius around it take 1 point of splash damage per weapon damage die.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Firearm**: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
