Favored by caravan guards who traverse the Mana Wastes, a piercing wind is similar to a [[DATABASE/weapon/Jezail|jezail]], in that you can carry it in one hand as long as the other hand's free, by holding it under one arm. Additionally, it's fitted with an underslung curved blade.

## Traits

**Combination:**

Combination weapons combine the functionality of melee weapons and ranged weapons in unique or unusual ways. A combination weapon has a ranged form or usage and a melee weapon form or usage. The combination weapons table lists the ranged weapon statistics first and the melee weapon statistics indented beneath, just above the ammunition. Switching between the melee weapon usage and the ranged weapon usage requires an Interact action. However, if your last action was a successful melee Strike against a foe using a combination weapon, you can make a ranged Strike with the combination weapon against that foe without fully switching to the ranged weapon usage, firing the ranged weapon just as you hit with the melee attack. In this case, the combination weapon returns to its melee usage after the ranged weapon Strike.
 Since a combination weapon is one weapon with two usages, both usages share any fundamental runes. You can put a property rune on a combination weapon as long as it's appropriate for either of the two usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property rune's requirements, the effects of the property rune only apply for that usage. For instance, a _[[DATABASE/equipment/Vorpal|vorpal]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Axe Musket|axe musket]]_ only applies the _vorpal_ property rune when you're using it as an axe. Due to their complexity, combination weapons can't have another weapon, such as a [[DATABASE/weapon/Bayonet|bayonet]] or [[DATABASE/weapon/Reinforced Stock|reinforced stock]], attached to them.

**Concussive:**

These weapons smash as much as puncture. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.

**Critical Fusion:**

Critical fusion is a trait for combination weapons that grants you two additional options for the critical specialization effect when using the combination weapon's melee version to make a melee attack while the ranged weapon is loaded. If you choose to use one of them, it replaces the melee usage's normal critical specialization effect.
 First, if the ranged weapon is a [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Firearm|firearm]], you can discharge it to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the ranged weapon to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both of these options discharge the ranged weapon, which typically means you have to reload it before firing it again.

**Fatal Aim d10:**

It’s possible to hold the stock of this weapon under one arm so you can fire it with a single hand as long as the other hand isn’t holding a weapon, shield, or anything else you would need to move and position, to ensure the weapon doesn’t slip out from under your arm. However, if you use both hands, the weapon can make fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two hands, it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die. Holding the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is significantly more complicated than just releasing one hand from the weapon, so to switch between the two grips, you must do so with an Interact action rather than Releasing or as part of reloading.

**Finesse:**

You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.

**Forceful:**

This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.

**Sweep:**

This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Firearm**: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
