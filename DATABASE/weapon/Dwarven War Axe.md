This favored weapon of the dwarves has a large, ornate head mounted on a thick handle. This powerful axe can be wielded with one hand or two.

## Traits

**Dwarf:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the dwarf ancestry. Dwarves are stout folk who often live underground and typically have [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by dwarves. An item with this trait is created and used by dwarves.

**Sweep:**

This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.

**Two-Hand 1d12:**

This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from _[[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]]_ runes.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Axe**: Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its _[[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]]_ rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
