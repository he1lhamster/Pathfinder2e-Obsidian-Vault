The polytool is a small metal rod with a number of simple tools folded inside. The user can extend a long ceramic blade, as well as an awl, chisel, file, [[Flint and Steel]], hook, inkpen, magnifying glass, pliers, scissors, and a small saw. The flint and steel can be used up to 10 times before needing to be replaced. Though inspired by advanced Numerian technology, the polytool is a simple enough feat of metalworking that any blacksmith could produce it—perfect for the goddess [[Casandalee]] to spread innovation farther than actual Numerian tech could reach.

## Traits

**Agile:**

The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Modular (B, P, or S):**

The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s description to list more complicated configurations.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Sword**: The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of your next turn.
