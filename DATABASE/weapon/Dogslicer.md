This short, curved, and crude makeshift blade often has holes drilled into it to reduce its weight. It’s a favored weapon of goblins.

## Traits

**Agile:**

The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Backstabber:**

When you hit a [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if the weapon is a _+3 weapon_.

**Finesse:**

You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.

**Goblin:**

A creature with this trait can be one of several kinds of creature, including [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblins]], [[DATABASE/ancestry/Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]], and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Bugbear|bugbears]]. Goblins tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins. A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Sword**: The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of your next turn.
