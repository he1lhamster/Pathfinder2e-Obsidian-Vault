## Traits

**Combination:**

Combination weapons combine the functionality of melee weapons and ranged weapons in unique or unusual ways. A combination weapon has a ranged form or usage and a melee weapon form or usage. The combination weapons table lists the ranged weapon statistics first and the melee weapon statistics indented beneath, just above the ammunition. Switching between the melee weapon usage and the ranged weapon usage requires an Interact action. However, if your last action was a successful melee Strike against a foe using a combination weapon, you can make a ranged Strike with the combination weapon against that foe without fully switching to the ranged weapon usage, firing the ranged weapon just as you hit with the melee attack. In this case, the combination weapon returns to its melee usage after the ranged weapon Strike.
 Since a combination weapon is one weapon with two usages, both usages share any fundamental runes. You can put a property rune on a combination weapon as long as it's appropriate for either of the two usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property rune's requirements, the effects of the property rune only apply for that usage. For instance, a _[[DATABASE/equipment/Vorpal|vorpal]] [[DATABASE/weapon/Axe Musket|axe musket]]_ only applies the _vorpal_ property rune when you're using it as an axe. Due to their complexity, combination weapons can't have another weapon, such as a [[DATABASE/weapon/Bayonet|bayonet]] or [[DATABASE/weapon/Reinforced Stock|reinforced stock]], attached to them.

**Concussive:**

These weapons smash as much as puncture. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.

**Critical Fusion:**

Critical fusion is a trait for combination weapons that grants you two additional options for the critical specialization effect when using the combination weapon's melee version to make a melee attack while the ranged weapon is loaded. If you choose to use one of them, it replaces the melee usage's normal critical specialization effect.
 First, if the ranged weapon is a [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Firearm|firearm]], you can discharge it to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the ranged weapon to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both of these options discharge the ranged weapon, which typically means you have to reload it before firing it again.

**Deadly d8:**

On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon's damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a _greater striking rune_ and three dice if the weapon has a _major striking rune_. For instance, a [[DATABASE/weapon/Rapier|rapier]] with a _greater striking rune_ deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon's normal damage dice doesn't change the size of its deadly die.

**Disarm:**

You can use this weapon to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] with the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.

**Fatal d8:**

The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Finesse:**

You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Firearm**: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
