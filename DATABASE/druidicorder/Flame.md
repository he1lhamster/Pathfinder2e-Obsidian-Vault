# Flame

**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
You feel a kinship with flames and can use them for succor and destruction. You're trained in [[Acrobatics]]. You also gain the [[Fire Lung]] druid feat. You gain the [[Wildfire]] order spell. Allowing unnatural fires to spread or preventing natural fires from occurring in a way that harms the environment are anathema to your order (this doesn't prevent you from using fire destructively or force you to combat a controlled or natural fire).
