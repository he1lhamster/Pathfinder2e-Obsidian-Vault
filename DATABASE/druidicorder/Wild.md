# Wild

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
The savage, uncontrollable call of the natural world infuses you, granting you the ability to change your shape and take on the ferocious form of a wild creature. You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]]. You also gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Wild Shape|Wild Shape]] druid feat. You gain the [[DATABASE/spell/Wild Morph|wild morph]] order spell. Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations of civilization is anathema to your order. (This doesn’t prevent you from buying and using processed goods or staying in a city for an adventure, but you can never come to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place your permanent home.)
