**Location** A claimed hex of the GM's choosing but not in the influence of a settlement
You hear that a well-preserved ruin in a remote reach of your kingdom may contain historical artifacts connected to people who lived in your land long ago. You can send a team of archaeologists to investigate.
**Kingdom Skill** [[Exploration]]; **Leader** Viceroy
**Critical Success** The site proves to be an ancient Kellid settlement that greatly predates the Taldan expansion into the region. Your people are delighted by the discovery. Reduce Unrest by 1d4, and until the end of your next Kingdom turn, all Culture- and Economy-based skill checks gain a +2 circumstance bonus. If any of your settlements has a Museum, you put archaeological findings from this hex on display to the further delight of your citizens. Reduce Unrest by an additional 1.
**Success** The site proves to be remains of an old Taldan camp from the Second Army of Exploration. The discovery is interesting but not particularly surprising. Reduce Unrest by 2.
**Failure** The site proves to be the remains of a relatively recent village abandoned during a previous attempt to settle the Stolen Lands. Nothing particularly interesting is discovered.
**Critical Failure** You never hear from your archaeologists again. Increase Unrest by 1d4 and Decay by 1. You can try to investigate this site again as a Region activity during the Activity phase of any Kingdom turn by attempting another Exploration check, but as the investigation has proven dangerous, the DC increases by 2.
