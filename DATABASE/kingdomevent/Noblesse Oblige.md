**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Location** A settlement that includes at least one mansion or noble villa. If there are no settlements in the kingdom with these structures, this event doesn't occur.
A noble family or wealthy benefactor offers to build an improvement to beautify the settlement.
**Kingdom Skill** [[Arts]]; **Leader** Viceroy
**Critical Success** The nobles build a monument and a park in lots of the players' choice at no expense to the kingdom (the [[Build Structure]] activity is not required).
**Success** The nobles pay the RP and Commodity cost of either a monument or a park, provided the party uses the Civic activity granted by this settlement in the next Kingdom turn to Build the Structure. The Build Structure check automatically succeeds.
**Failure** Although the nobles had good intentions, bickering among individual aristocrats ultimately prevents the project from ever taking place.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the bickering persists. Gain 1 Unrest and attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, your kingdom suffers a Feud event on the next turn's Event phase (in addition to any other event).
