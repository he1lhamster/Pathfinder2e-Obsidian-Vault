# Cult Activity<span class="item-type">Event +1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Continuous</span><span class="item-trait">Dangerous</span><span class="item-trait">Settlement</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Location** A randomly determined settlement of the GM's choice—the GM should not reveal which one to the PCs until they succeed at this event's [[DATABASE/skill/Intrigue|Intrigue]] check, as until then the location of the cult's hideout should remain a mystery to solve!
A religious cult opposed to the kingdom's goals or established religions begins kidnapping, converting, or sacrificing citizens. The cult remains secret and hidden in one of the nation's settlements, operating out of a covert temple or safehouse somewhere in the settlement. You must attempt the Intrigue check to locate the cult each Kingdom turn until you succeed in doing so; then, you must attempt the [[DATABASE/skill/Folklore|Folklore]] check each Kingdom turn until you defeat the cult.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Intrigue|Intrigue]]; **Leader** Magister
**Critical Success** You discover which settlement houses the cult's headquarters. When you attempt Folklore checks to defeat the cult, reduce the DC by 5.
**Success** As success, but without reducing the Folklore DC. Increase Unrest by 1 as a result of the cult's activities.
**Failure** You fail to determine where the cult's headquarters are. Increase Unrest by 1 as a result of the cult's activities.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but increase Unrest by 1d4 and increase Corruption by 1.

**Resolution** After the cult's headquarters are discovered, to end this continuous event the PCs must defeat the cult by succeeding at the Folklore check. Optionally, the GM can build a short adventure for the PCs to infiltrate the cult headquarters and defeat them in encounter mode.
**Special** If this event occurs in a settlement with a Sewer System, you take a –2 item penalty to Intrigue checks to discover the cult's hideout. If this event occurs while the PCs are playing through Chapter 5, increase the event's level modifier to +3. The cult in this case is always associated with the worship of [[DATABASE/deity/Lamashtu|Lamashtu]].
