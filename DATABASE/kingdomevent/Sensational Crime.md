# Sensational Crime<span class="item-type">Event +1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Continuous</span><span class="item-trait">Dangerous</span><span class="item-trait">Settlement</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Location** A randomly determined settlement in the kingdom
A notorious serial killer, deadly arsonist, flamboyant jewel thief, or otherwise sensational criminal plagues your kingdom.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Intrigue|Intrigue]]; **Leader** Warden
**Critical Success** The criminal has been caught and the one-person crime wave ends. Reduce Crime by 2, and reduce one other Ruin of your choice by 2. In addition, if you achieve this level of success on the turn this event begins, the criminal was caught in the act of perpetrating their first crime but prevented from completing it; in this case, you discourage future criminals—reduce Crime by 1.
**Success** You foil the criminal's current plans and perhaps arrest some accomplices, but the mastermind gets away to plot future crimes. Increase Unrest by 1.
**Failure** The criminal succeeds in their crime and escapes justice. Increase Unrest by 1d4 and Crime by 1.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the criminal also makes fools out of law enforcement, frames an innocent for the crime, or taunts the authorities for their failure. Increase Unrest by 1d6, Crime by 2, and one other Ruin of your choice by 2.

**Resolution** This continuous event ends when you achieve a critical success on the check. Alternately, the GM could create a short adventure to allow the PCs to step in, track down, and confront the criminal to end the event.
