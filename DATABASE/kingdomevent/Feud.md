**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Location** Two settlements of the GM's choice. If the kingdom doesn't have at least two settlements, then this event has no effect.
A rivalry between influential groups (nobles, guilds, politicians, etc.) from two different settlements has escalated and may soon turn violent.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Politics|Politics]]; **Leader** Counselor
**Critical Success** You mediate the rivals' differences and not only get them to drop their feud, but also broker an alliance between the two. The feud ends, and the rivals are particularly productive during the next turn. Gain 2 bonus Resource Dice at the beginning of the next Kingdom turn.
**Success** You get the rivals to back down, though their mutual dislike simmers behind the scenes. The feud continues into the next turn.
**Failure** You fail to quiet the rivals and they continue duels, rumormongering, intrigue, and strife. The conflict prevents you from recruiting armies in the two affected settlements until the next Kingdom turn. Increase Unrest by 1.
**Critical Failure** The rivals ignore royal commands and disrupt both settlements with their private war. The ongoing feud prevents you from recruiting armies in the two affected settlements until the feud ends. In addition, skirmishing increases Unrest by 2 and one Ruin of your choice by 1; these increases are doubled to 4 Unrest and 2 Ruin if you critically failed this check last turn.

**Resolution** The feud ends when you achieve a critical success on the check. If this continuous event has occurred for at least 3 consecutive Kingdom turns, you may choose to resolve it at the end of a Kingdom turn by spending 4 Resource Dice of RP to pay off the feuding factions.
