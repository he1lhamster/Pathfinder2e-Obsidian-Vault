**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
A natural cataclysm such as a wildfire, devastating weather, earthquake, or flood (as determined by the GM) devastates your kingdom. While in a worst-case scenario the disaster's immediate and most destructive effects affect a single settlement, many of its effects are larger in scope and can affect the entire kingdom.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Wilderness|Wilderness]]; **Leader** Magister
**Critical Success** You prepared well for the disaster. While disruptive, the damage is minimized.
**Success** Your quick response keeps your people safe and allows you to recover quickly. During the next turn, reduce your Resource Dice total by 4.
**Failure** The disaster causes severe damage. Choose one claimed hex in which you have a Farmland or Work Site; that feature is destroyed. Gain 1 Decay and 1d6 Unrest. During the next turn, reduce your Resource Dice total by 6.
**Critical Failure** Multiple hexes are totally devastated. Choose 1d6 claimed hexes in which you have Farmlands or Work Sites; those features are destroyed. Gain 1 Decay for each hex affected, and gain 2d6 Unrest. In addition, one settlement of your choice is particularly hard hit; that settlement immediately suffers the effects of a [[DATABASE/kingdomevent/Local Disaster|Local Disaster]]. During the next turn, reduce your Resource Dice total by 8.
