After the PCs defeat the Beast at the end of Chapter 4, citizens in the kingdom who emulate Amiri revel in the triumph. Unless the PCs intervene, these eager citizens turn the Beast's hide into a massive rug and put it on display in the kingdom's largest tavern. From there, the hunger for monstrous trophies unfortunately continues to grow.
 This event takes place at the end of the next Kingdom turn, as numerous eager adventurers who are fans of Amiri join together and scour the wilderness for another monster trophy to add to the tavern's growing collection.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Wilderness|Wilderness]]; **Leader** Warden
**Critical Success** The eager monster hunters confront and defeat a Huge (or larger) monster in the wilderness. The GM can determine the exact type of monster hunted down (but it shouldn't be a specific creature still awaiting discovery by the PCs in a hex encounter). Trophies from the monster are put on display in a tavern or other public building in the capital city. Gain one additional Fame or Infamy point (as appropriate) at the start of the next Kingdom turn and reduce Unrest by 1d6.
**Success** As critical success, but the monster hunters track down and slay a Large monster in the wilderness. Reduce Unrest by 1d4.
**Failure** The monster hunters fail in their attempt to hunt a creature, but the kingdom was, if only for a short while, distracted by the attempt. Reduce Unrest by 1.
**Critical Failure** The monster hunters confront a Huge (or larger) monster but fail to defeat it. Worse, the monster follows the surviving hunters back home and attacks the kingdom's capital city! Increase Unrest by 1d4 and one Ruin of the players' choice by 1. The monster then retreats to the wilderness, but it continues to be a danger. A [[DATABASE/kingdomevent/Monster Activity|Monster Activity]] event automatically takes place during the next Kingdom turn as this creature continues to threaten the region.
