# Undead Uprising<span class="item-type">Event +0</span>

<span class="item-trait">Continuous</span><span class="item-trait">Dangerous</span><span class="item-trait">Settlement</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Location** The settlement with the most cemeteries or (if no settlements have cemeteries) the largest settlement
A malign force, be it a sinister curse, a nefarious necromancer, or an invasion of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghoul|ghouls]], [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire|vampires]], or other undead-creating monsters, causes the dead to rise from their graves and threaten the settlement.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Folklore|Folklore]]; **Leader** Magister
**Critical Success** The undead are defeated.
**Success** The undead are temporarily contained with little physical damage to your settlement, but the populace still grow fearful each night. Increase Unrest by 1.
**Failure** The undead prey upon your citizens! Increase Unrest by 1d4 and one Ruin of your choice by 1.
**Critical Failure** The undead gain the advantage and bring disaster. Increase Unrest by 2d4, all Ruins by 1, and one non-cemetery lot in your settlement (chosen by the players) is reduced to rubble.

**Resolution** A critical success on the check ends this continuous event. Alternately, the GM can create a short adventure for the PCs to track down and destroy the source of the undead uprising.
**Special** Increase the event's level modifier by 1 for each Graveyard in the settlement, to a maximum of +4.
