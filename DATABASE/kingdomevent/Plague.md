<span class="item-trait">Continuous</span><span class="item-trait">Dangerous</span><span class="item-trait">Settlement</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Location** The largest settlement in the kingdom
A deadly sickness strikes one of your settlements. You take a –2 status penalty to all Civic activities made in a settlement suffering from a plague unless the settlement has a sewer system.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Defense|Defense]]; **Leader** Ruler
**Critical Success** You halt the spread of the plague and are able to cure it, but even so, the plague’s effects reduce your Resource Dice on the next turn by 2.
**Success** The plague continues! Gain 1d4 Unrest and increase one of your Ruins by 1.
**Failure** The plague spreads and claims more victims. Gain 1d6 Unrest and increase all of your Ruins by 1.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the plague spreads to the nearest unaffected settlement in your kingdom. Treat additional plagues in different settlements as separate continuous Plague events.

**Resolution** This Plague event ends if you achieve a critical success on the check or after you achieve a total of 4 successes with the Provide Care activity (a critical success with Provide Care counts as 2 successes in this case).
**Special** If the plague strikes a settlement that has no dumps, filth in the streets allows the disease to spread more easily. You take a –4 item penalty to checks to resolve this event. On the other hand, if a plague-stricken settlement has a sewer system, the increased sanitation provides a +2 item bonus to checks to resolve this event.
