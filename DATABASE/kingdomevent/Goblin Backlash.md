 Your citizens doubt your wisdom in appointing Nok-Nok and worry that his unsavory personality traits might cause issues for the kingdom overall. If Nok-Nok is still chaotic evil, you take a –2 circumstance penalty in resolving this event.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Politics|Politics]]; **Leader** Ruler
**Critical Success** You convince the citizens that Nok-Nok will do well, and use his appointment to prove that you are seeking to build a diverse kingdom where anyone can find a role in shaping its destiny. The event ends, and your citizens grow more accepting of all people. Word of your kingdom's acceptance of normally shunned elements of society spreads, and from this point on, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all [[DATABASE/action/New Leadership|New Leadership]], [[DATABASE/action/Quell Unrest|Quell Unrest]], and [[DATABASE/action/Pledge of Fealty|Pledge of Fealty]] checks.
**Success** You prevent the unrest from growing, but the citizens continue to grumble and grouse about Nok-Nok into the next kingdom turn.
**Failure** The people rise up, with protests and even a few riots taking place as concerned citizens fan the flames of dissent in the kingdom. Gain 1 Unrest.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but gain 1d4 Unrest. In addition, an [[DATABASE/kingdomevent/Assassination Attempt|Assassination Attempt]] event takes place immediately after resolving this event, with Nok-Nok as the target. The assassin itself should be a non-good, previously unnamed NPC citizen in the PC's kingdom. They weren't hired by anyone, instead acting on their own to remove a perceived threat (Nok-Nok) to the kingdom's well-being.

**Resolution** You can end this continuous event with a critical success on the check. Alternately, if the PCs remove Nok-Nok from his leadership position (including if he's killed), the event ends. If the PCs do this though, and then attempt to install Nok-Nok as a leader at a later date, this event occurs again but its level is increased by 1.
