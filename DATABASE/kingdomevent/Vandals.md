**Location** A randomly determined settlement
Vandals, troublemakers, and dissidents destroy property in your settlement.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Industry|Industry]]; **Leader** Warden
**Critical Success** You root out the vandals and stop them from causing any damage.
**Success** The vandals are caught in the act of damaging an area in your settlement. The event ends, but on the next turn, the damage done reduces your Resource Dice by 2.
**Failure** The vandals damage and deface several minor structures in the settlement and remain uncaught for now. Fortunately, the damage done can be easily repaired, but you start the next turn with 4 fewer Resource Dice.
**Critical Failure** The vandals also manage to reduce one structure (chosen by the players) to rubble. Increase Unrest by 1d4 and reduce your Resource Dice next turn by 4.
