<span class="item-trait">Beneficial</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
A sudden absence of political machinations and distracting intrigue coincides with a rise in public approval for its leaders.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Politics|Politics]]; **Leader** Ruler
**Critical Success** You capitalize upon the public approval with efficiency and speed. Reduce Unrest by 1d6 or reduce one Ruin of your choice by 1. Gain a +2 status bonus to all checks made to resolve events during your next Kingdom turn.
**Success** Loyalty is up across the board. Reduce Unrest by 1d4.
**Failure** The calm is a refreshing change, but people sense it cannot last. Reduce Unrest by 1.
**Critical Failure** The calm simply hides deeper plotting simmering in the shadows. Increase one Ruin by 1.
