# Local Disaster<span class="item-type">Event +0</span>

<span class="item-trait">Dangerous</span><span class="item-trait">Settlement</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Location** A randomly determined settlement
A disaster strikes the settlement, be it fire, flooding, earthquakes, an architectural failure, or the like.
**Kingdom Skill** [[Industry]]; **Leader** Magister
**Critical Success** You prepared well for the disaster and the settlement survives intact and undamaged.
**Success** The settlement still functions despite the loss of some resources. During the next turn, reduce your Resource Dice total by 2.
**Failure** Several lots in the settlement are torn up, including at least one structure. Gain 1 Decay and place rubble into three lots of the PCs' choice in the settlement's Urban Grid. During the next turn, reduce your Resource Dice total by 4.
**Critical Failure** Destruction is widespread. Roll 1d6 and gain that number of points of Decay. Then select an equal number of adjacent blocks in your settlement and place rubble into one lot of your choice within each selected block. If a structure is in that lot, it's reduced to rubble. During the next turn, reduce your Resource Dice total by 6.

**Special** If this event occurs in a settlement with a cemetery, fewer resources are needed to properly honor those who die during the event. Halve all Resource Dice reductions created by this event.
