Demagogues and zealots mobilize public opinion against a particular ancestry, religion, kingdom, behavior, or leader. This particular inquisition's dogma and beliefs are driven by a combination of fear, hatred, and ignorance, yet its members are nevertheless compelling and charismatic.

**Critical Success** Choose to either pacify or defeat the inquisitors. If you pacify them, the inquisition event ends but the inquisitors remain active—if this event occurs again, they are even more headstrong; increase the event's level modifier by 2. If you defeat them, the inquisition ends but the violence of the event increases one Ruin of your choice by 1.
**Success** You protect the targeted victims of the inquisition, though the inquisition's ideas continue to spread. Increase Unrest by 1.
**Failure** The inquisitors strike out in force. Gain 1d4 Unrest and increase two Ruins of your choice by 1.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the Inquisition targets a specific structure in one of your settlements (the GM selects a structure appropriate to the inquisition's nature of intolerance or hatred). Attempt a basic Defense check. If you fail, that structure is reduced to Rubble and increase Decay by 1.

**Resolution** This event continues until you achieve a critical success at resolving the event. Alternately, the inquisition can be ended by having the PCs go on a short quest to infiltrate the inquisition's headquarters to confront and defeat its leaders.
