Bandits have begun to prey upon your kingdom!
**Kingdom Skill** [[Defense]]; **Leader** Warden
**Critical Success** The bandits are captured, run off, or defeated, and merchants can confidently ply their wares. Reduce Unrest by 1d4, and during the next Kingdom turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Economy-based checks.
**Success** The bandits are prevented from preying upon your people, but they continue to be active. Your Resource Dice are reduced by 1 at the start of your next Kingdom turn.
**Failure** The bandits plunder caravans and remote storehouses, and merchants grow cautious and afraid. Gain 1 Unrest, and at the start of your next Kingdom turn, your Resource Dice are reduced by 4.
**Critical Failure** Bandits rampage the land, and even start to encroach into your settlements. Gain 1d4 Unrest, increase a Ruin of your choice by 1, and at the start of your next Kingdom turn your Resource Dice are halved or reduced by 4, whichever results in a lower total.

**Resolution** You can end this continuous event with a critical success on the check. Alternately, if the PCs are eager to seek out the bandits, the GM could build a short side quest to play out their attempt to defeat them.
