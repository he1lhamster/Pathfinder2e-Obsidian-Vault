**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
The authorities catch a notorious criminal, exonerate a wrongfully accused innocent, shut down a major criminal operation, or thwart a plot against a settlement. Whatever the case, some injustice that has long vexed your citizens has finally been resolved.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Statecraft|Statecraft]]; **Leader** Warden
**Critical Success** The triumph of law and justice invites celebration. Reduce Unrest by 1d6 and reduce each Ruin by 1. Alternately, if you're suffering from a continuous Bandit Activity, Cult Activity, Drug Den, Inquisition, Sacrifices, Sensational Crime, Squatters, or Vandals event, you can instead cause that event to end.
**Success** A celebration of the common good delights the locals. Reduce Unrest by 1d4 or reduce two Ruins of your choice by 1 each.
**Failure** Justice is done, but at a cost of bad publicity. If you don't Quell Unrest at least once during the next Kingdom turn, the kingdom gains 1d4 Unrest at the end of the next turn.
**Critical Failure** The victory is undercut by backdoor deals that let the guilty escape justice or reveal unpleasant secrets. Gain 1d4 Unrest, 2 Crime, and 1 point to another Ruin of your choice.
