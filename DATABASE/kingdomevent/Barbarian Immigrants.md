_Nethys note: This event requires that Amiri is a companion._
Once the PCs defeat Armag at the end of Chapter 7, the Tiger Lord barbarians scatter back into the surrounding wilderness, but some of them are drawn by Amiri's reputation and look to join the PCs' kingdom. This event occurs during the first Kingdom turn after Armag's defeat.
**Kingdom Skill** [[Statecraft]]; **Leader** Warden
**Critical Success** A large number of barbarians are welcomed into several settlements. Their presence helps to bolster a sense of security (decrease Unrest by 1d6), and also helps to curtail bandit and monster activity. From this point on, kingdom checks made to resolve the following random events gain a +2 circumstance bonus: [[Bandit Activity]], [[Monster Activity]], and [[Undead Uprising]].
**Success** As critical success, but decrease Unrest by 1d4 and the circumstance bonus is only +1.
**Failure** The integration of the barbarians into the kingdom is a bit rougher than expected and doesn't provide additional defense against events. Reduce Unrest by 1.
**Critical Failure** The barbarians and citizens clash violently. Increase Unrest by 1d4 and one Ruin of the players' choice by 1; the barbarians then scatter back into the wilderness.
