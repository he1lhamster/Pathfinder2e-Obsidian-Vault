# Sacrifices<span class="item-type">Event +2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Continuous</span><span class="item-trait">Dangerous</span><span class="item-trait">Hex-KM</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Location** A claimed hex in the area of influence of a settlement secretly chosen by the GM
A cabal of cultists begin snatching citizens and preparing them for sacrifice to their vile god. The cultists maintain a hidden base of operations somewhere near one of the kingdom's settlements.
**Kingdom Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Exploration|Exploration]]; **Leader** Emissary
**Critical Success** The cultists are defeated, and many of your captured citizens are rescued.
**Success** The cult continues to function, but you have managed to determine which hex their base of operations is located in. The DC to defeat the Sacrifices event is reduced by 4 in subsequent turns. Increase Unrest by 1.
**Failure** The cultists prey on travelers, hunters, trappers, and anyone else who strays too far from civilization. Increase Unrest by 1d4 and one Ruin of your choice by 1.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the cultists start snatching victims from your settlements. If you've already determined where they've based their operations, they successfully relocate to a new secret hex as chosen by the GM, and the DC to defeat the cultists returns to normal. Increase Unrest by 1d6 and two Ruins of your choice by 2.

**Resolution** A critical success ends this continuous event. The GM can instead build a short adventure for the PCs to track down and defeat the sinister cultists in encounter mode, provided the PCs know where to go to confront the cultists!
