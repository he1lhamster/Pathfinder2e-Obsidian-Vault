# Elemental Diplomat

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Gennayn|Gennayn]]
A gennayn's modifier for [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] is equal to your level plus your key spellcasting attribute modifier, rather than just your level. The gennayn gets a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks against elementals and grants you the same bonus if you're in the same space.
