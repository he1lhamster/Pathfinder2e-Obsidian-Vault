**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Clockwork Familiar|Clockwork Familiar]]
Your clockwork familiar enters standby mode. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when you Command it to exit standby mode, it does so, by using this action again.
