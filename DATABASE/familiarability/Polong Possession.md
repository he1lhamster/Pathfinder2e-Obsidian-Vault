**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Polong|Polong]]
The polong attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. The creature must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the polong merges into the creature's body for 1 minute (24 hours on a critical failure). The polong can observe through the creature's senses but is unable to control the creature. The possessed creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] while the possession lasts. While possessing a creature, a polong can ignore the distance and line of effect limitation from its anchored incorporeality ability; when the possession ends, it immediately returns to the bottle if it's beyond range.
