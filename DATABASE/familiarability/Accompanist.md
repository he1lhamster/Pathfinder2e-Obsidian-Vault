# Accompanist

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Ability Type** Familiar
Your familiar helps you perform. Whenever you attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check, if your familiar is nearby and can act, it accompanies you with chirps, claps, or its own miniature instrument. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus, or +2 if you're a master in Performance.
