**Ability Type** Familiar
Your familiar helps you perform. Whenever you attempt a [[Performance]] check, if your familiar is nearby and can act, it accompanies you with chirps, claps, or its own miniature instrument. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus, or +2 if you're a master in Performance.
