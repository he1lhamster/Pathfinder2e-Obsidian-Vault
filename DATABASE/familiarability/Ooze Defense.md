# Ooze Defense

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Spellslime|Spellslime]]
Your spellslime familiar is easy to hit, but it lacks weak points. It is immune to critical hits and precision damage, but its AC is only 10 + your level (instead of an AC equal to yours).
