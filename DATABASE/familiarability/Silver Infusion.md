**Source** [[Shadows at Sundown]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[House Drake]]
Your house drake breathes on one of your weapons. Until the start of your next turn, that weapon counts as [[Silver Weapon]] instead of its normal material for any physical damage it deals. The house drake can't use Breath Weapon or Silver Infusion for 1d4 rounds.
