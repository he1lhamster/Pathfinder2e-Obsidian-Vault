**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/House Drake|House Drake]]
Your house drake breathes on one of your weapons. Until the start of your next turn, that weapon counts as [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|silver]] instead of its normal material for any physical damage it deals. The house drake can't use Breath Weapon or Silver Infusion for 1d4 rounds.
