# Threat Display

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Ability Type** Familiar
Your familiar helps you convey wordless threats through body language. Whenever you attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a creature, if your familiar is within 30 feet of your target and can act, it accompanies you with snarls, hisses, or raising its hackles. If it can do so, you don't take the normal –4 penalty on the Intimidation check if your target doesn't understand the language you're speaking.
