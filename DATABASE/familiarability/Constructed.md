# Constructed

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Clockwork Familiar|Clockwork Familiar]]
Your clockwork familiar is made of metal rather than flesh and bone, although it is still delicate enough in certain places to be vulnerable to violence in the same manner as a living creature. It is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]], healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], poison, [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]], and [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]]. It can recover Hit Points only via the [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repair]] action and other methods that fix items, not from any form of Hit Point healing. It's destroyed at 0 Hit Points.
