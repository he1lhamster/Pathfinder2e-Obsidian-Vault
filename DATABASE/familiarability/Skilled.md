# Skilled

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Ability Type** Familiar
Choose a skill other than [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]]. Your familiar's modifier for that skill is equal to your level plus your key spellcasting ability modifier, rather than just your level. You can select this ability repeatedly, choosing a different skill each time.
