# Skilled

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Ability Type** Familiar
Choose a skill other than [[Acrobatics]] or [[Stealth]]. Your familiar's modifier for that skill is equal to your level plus your key spellcasting ability modifier, rather than just your level. You can select this ability repeatedly, choosing a different skill each time.
