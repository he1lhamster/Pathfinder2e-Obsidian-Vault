# Alchemical Gut

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
**Ability Type** Familiar
Your familiar can act as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Bomb Coagulant Alembic|bomb coagulant alembic]] by swallowing the bomb to be affected, which takes two Interact actions from it and one from you. Your familiar regurgitates the concentrated item 1 minute later. If your familiar tries to distill a bomb that's level is higher than your own —1, it instead takes damage as though it were successfully struck with the bomb.
