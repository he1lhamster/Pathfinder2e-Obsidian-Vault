# Clockwork

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Clockwork Familiar|Clockwork Familiar]]
You need to keep your clockwork familiar wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous or time consuming. If you spend 1 minute winding up your clockwork familiar with a unique key only you can use, it can remain active for 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again.
 Enemies can attempt to disable the clockwork familiar, with a standard DC for your level to [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]], to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour (or 2 hours on a critical success). Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the clockwork familiar's remaining operational time.
 Some abilities, like Steam Screen, require your clockwork familiar to spend some of its remaining operational time. It can't spend more than it has and shuts down immediately once it has no time remaining.
 You can wind your clockwork familiar for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.
