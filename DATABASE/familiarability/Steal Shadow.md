# Steal Shadow <span class="action-icon">1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Necromancy</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Shadow Familiar|Shadow Familiar]]
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Effect** The shadow familiar makes a melee attack with an attack roll modifier equal to your spell attack roll modifier. If the Strike is successful, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] and its shadow disappears. After 24 hours, the enfeebled condition ends, and they regain their shadow once more. Any effect that reduces or removes the enfeebled condition restores their shadow as well.
 This action has the trait matching your tradition of magic, or occult if you aren't a spellcaster.
