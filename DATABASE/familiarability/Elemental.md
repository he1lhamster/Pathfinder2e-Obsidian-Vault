# Elemental

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
**Ability Type** Familiar
Your familiar has the elemental trait instead of the animal trait. Choose air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood. Your familiar gains that trait. The familiar is immune to bleed, [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], poison, sleep, and the element matching its trait. Your familiar must have the [[DATABASE/familiarability/Resistance|resistance]] familiar ability to select this, unless it's a specific familiar. You can't select this ability if your familiar has a trait other than animal (such as a leshy familiar or an undead familiar).
