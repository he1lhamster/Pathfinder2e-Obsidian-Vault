# Spellcasting

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Ability Type** Familiar
Choose a spell in your repertoire or that you prepared today that is at least 5 levels lower than your highest-level spell slot. Your familiar can Cast that Spell once per day using your magical tradition, spell attack modifier, and spell DC. If the spell has a drawback that affects the caster, both you and your familiar are affected. You must be able to cast 6th-level spells using spell slots to select this ability.
