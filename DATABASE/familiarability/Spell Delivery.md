# Spell Delivery

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Ability Type** Master
If your familiar is in your space, you can cast a spell with a range of touch, transfer its power to your familiar, and command the familiar to deliver the spell. If you do, the familiar uses its 2 actions for the round to move to a target of your choice and touch that target. If it doesn’t reach the target to touch it this turn, the spell has no effect.
