# Turn of Fate <span class="action-icon">2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Divination</span>
**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[Ceru]]
**Frequency** once per day; **Range** 30 feet ; **Effect** Your ceru shifts the scales of fortune for one target's next attempt at an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. If targeted with bad fortune, the target attempts a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, with effects depending on the result of their save; this is a misfortune effect. If targeted with good fortune, the target rolls twice and uses the better result; this is a fortune effect. Regardless of outcome, targets are immune to Turn of Fate for one day.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The target rolls twice and uses the worse result.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is affected for the next three attempts.
