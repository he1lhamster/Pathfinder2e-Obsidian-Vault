**Source** [[Grand Bazaar]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[Clockwork Familiar]]
**Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** Your clockwork familiar blows a billowing plume of steam into its square around itself. It gains a +1 circumstance bonus to its [[Intimidation]] checks, and any creature in the familiar's square has [[Concealed]], though creatures in the square can't use this concealment to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]]. The steam and its effects remain for 1 round. To use this ability, your clockwork familiar must spend 1 hour of operational time.
