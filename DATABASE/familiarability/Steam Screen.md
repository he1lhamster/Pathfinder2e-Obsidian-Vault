**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Clockwork Familiar|Clockwork Familiar]]
**Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** Your clockwork familiar blows a billowing plume of steam into its square around itself. It gains a +1 circumstance bonus to its [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks, and any creature in the familiar's square has [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealment]], though creatures in the square can't use this concealment to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] or [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]]. The steam and its effects remain for 1 round. To use this ability, your clockwork familiar must spend 1 hour of operational time.
