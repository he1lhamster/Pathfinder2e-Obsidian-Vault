**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Nosoi|Nosoi]]
**Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The nosoi croons an entrancing song. Each living or undead creature within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] for 1 round. A nosoi can use a 2-action activity, which has the auditory, concentrate, divine, enchantment, and mental traits, to force affected creatures to attempt another Will save; on a failure, they are fascinated for an additional round. A creature that succeeds at any save or has its fascination broken is temporarily immune for 24 hours. Despite being a mental effect, this ability affects mindless undead. Psychopomps are immune to this ability.
