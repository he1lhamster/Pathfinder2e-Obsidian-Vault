**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[Mood Cloud]]
**Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The cloud of sentiment changes the expression on its miniature face. It prepares to [[Aid]] you on a skill check for a skill matching its expression: [[Deception]] for an inscrutable expression, [[Diplomacy]] for a friendly expression, or [[Intimidation]] for an angry expression. It gains a reaction this round, which it can use only to Aid you in this way. It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with the skill or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question.
