**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[Shadow Familiar]]
The shadow familiar transforms its body into barely tangible shadow. It gains resistance to all damage (except force) equal to half your level but can't use any actions requiring a physical form. The familiar can also slip through gaps at least 2 inches wide, or 1 inch wide if it [[Squeeze]]. It can use this action again to return to its normal form.
 This action has the trait matching your tradition of magic, or occult if you aren't a spellcaster.
