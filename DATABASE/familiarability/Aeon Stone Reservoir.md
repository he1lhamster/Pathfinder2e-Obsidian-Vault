# Aeon Stone Reservoir

**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[Aeon Wyrd]]
Your aeon wyrd can hold any _[[Aeon Stone]]_ as a powerfully resonant nucleus that holds it together. You gain the _aeon stone's_ benefits without needing to use one of your investiture slots for the day, and you also gain the _aeon stone's_ resonant power, without interfering with any [[Wayfinder]] you invest.
