# Aeon Stone Reservoir

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/PFS Guide|PFS Guide]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Aeon Wyrd|Aeon Wyrd]]
Your aeon wyrd can hold any _[[DATABASE/equipment/Aeon Stone|aeon stone]]_ as a powerfully resonant nucleus that holds it together. You gain the _aeon stone's_ benefits without needing to use one of your investiture slots for the day, and you also gain the _aeon stone's_ resonant power, without interfering with any [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]] you invest.
