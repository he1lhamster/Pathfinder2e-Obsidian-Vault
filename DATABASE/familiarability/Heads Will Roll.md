# Heads Will Roll

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Talking Head|Talking Head]]
Unless its master gives the talking head the [[DATABASE/familiarability/Flier|flier]] ability, a talking head is able to move only by rolling along the ground, reducing its speed to 15 feet. Alternatively, a creature can, as a single action, kick or throw the head 30 feet. This can't be used as an attack; the head bounces harmlessly off anything it hits.
