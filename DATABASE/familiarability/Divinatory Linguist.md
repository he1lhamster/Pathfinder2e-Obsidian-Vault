# Divinatory Linguist

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Pipefox|Pipefox]]
Thanks to its innate tendency for divinations, your pipefox speaks and understands all languages you know (instead of just one) as well as one common language you don't know.
