# Plant Form

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Ability Type** Familiar
Your plant familiar can change shape as a single action, transforming into a Tiny plant of a type roughly similar to the familiar's nature. This otherwise uses the effects of [[Tree Shape]]. You must have a familiar with the plant trait, such as a leshy, to select this ability.
