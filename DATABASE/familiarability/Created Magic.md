# Created Magic

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[Ceru]]
Your ceru familiar grants you the [[Mage Hand]] and [[Guidance]] cantrips via the cantrip connection granted ability. If one or more of these cantrips isn't on your spell list, you can replace the cantrip or cantrips not on your spell list with a cantrip or cantrips from your spell list instead.
