**Ability Type** Specific Familiar - [[DATABASE/familiarspecific/Poppet|Poppet]]
Your poppet's components make it particularly vulnerable to fire. It gains weakness to fire equal to your level. You can spend an additional familiar ability, either permanently or on a per-day basis, to reinforce the poppet's construction, removing this weakness.
