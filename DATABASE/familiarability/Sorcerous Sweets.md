During your daily preparations, your sweetened familiar conducts an unusual little ritual. Your familiar find a small non-magical object (a flower or piece of fallen fruit by preference, but a pebble or even a coin will do in a pinch) and then does a curious ritual dance around—gingerbread sparrows hop and chirp, while hard candy beetles turndle in increasingly complex geometric patterns and chocolate mice make arcane sigils with their paws. At the rite's conclusion, the object turns into a piece of candy, usually of the same sort as the familiar. The candy is an item with the arcane, consumable and transmutation traits. Anyone who eats the candy as an [[DATABASE/action/Interact|Interact]] action gains a +1 item bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]], [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], and [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks for 1 hour (this increases to +2 at level 9, and +3 at level 17). The candy maintains its enchantment until your next daily preparations.
