Although this spell has spread throughout the Inner Sea, it likely came first from Nex, where it is used to raise alarms or notify the populace of new policies. In any case, the ritual works by placing several simple illusions throughout the area, allowing the caster to transmit their voice throughout the area.
**Critical Success** The ritual creates six 'mouths', like [[Magic Mouth]], at palces you select within the area. By spending a single action with the concentrate trait, you can command the mouths to speak—they can say anything you like, and you can set them to repeat messages or annoucements at any interval you choose. You can also choose to have only certain mouths speek. Any secondary casters you includ in the ritual, even beyond the two required, can speak through the mouths in the same way you can.
**Success** As critical success, but the ritual creates three mouths
**Failure** The ritual has no effect
**Critical Failure** The mouths form, and promptly start screaming, gibbering, and/or swearing at passers by—it is impossible to get any rest or relaxation within hearing range of the mouths until their magic wears out in about a day.
