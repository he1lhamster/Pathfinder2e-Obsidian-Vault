You infest the area with tenacious, biting insects that disease and drain life from creatures in the area. Arthropods (insects, spiders, and similar invertebrates) are unaffected and instead gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and Perception checks while within the area. All other creatures are harassed by insects and exposed to the disease witch's hunger when they enter the area and once per day thereafter that they remain in the area. As part of casting this ritual, you create a Tiny ritual insect hive (Hardness 5, 10 HP) that must remain in the ritual's area. If the hive is removed or destroyed, the ritual's effect ends 1 hour later.
 **Witch's Hunger** (disease) **Saving Throw** Fortitude; **Onset** 1d6 hours; **Stage 1** [[Enfeebled]] (1 day); **Stage 2** enfeebled 2 (1 day); **Stage 3** enfeebled 2 and [[Slowed]] (1 day); **Stage 4** [[Unconscious]]; **Stage 5** death
**Critical Success** As success, and the disease is especially deadly, with Stage 3 instead causing unconsciousness and Stage 4 instead causing death.
**Success** You create the ritual hive and cast the ritual.
**Failure** You fail to cast the ritual.
**Critical Failure** You fail to cast the ritual and instead cause ravenous insects to torment you, immediately exposing you to the witch's hunger disease.
