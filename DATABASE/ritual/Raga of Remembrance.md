You scribe occult symbols on unblighted Vudran ground, laying the ceramics within them to create a ritual space. To perform the ritual, light incense in the ceramics and sit at the center of the ritual space. You then play the [[DATABASE/action/Craft Disharmonic Instrument|disharmonic instrument]], drawing on musical skill, occult harmonics, or religious tradition. This establishes an underlying drone atop which the secondary casters layer their own performances. The song calls to the millions who died defending Vudra from [[DATABASE/monster/Kothogaz, Dance Of Disharmony|Kothogaz]], investing their power in Vanitapati, the legendary psychic.
**Critical Success** A towering, ethereal avatar of Vanitapati manifests around you, surrounded by swirling spirits. The avatar weakens Kothogaz's spirit. While Kothogaz is within 1 mile of you, it is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 2]] and is permanently destroyed if reduced to 0 Hit Points.
**Success** As critical success, but Kothogaz is frightened 1.
**Failure** The dead come to your aid, but their presence is unnerving. As success, but Kothogaz isn't frightened, and the primary and secondary casters take a –1 status penalty to saving throws against emotion effects.
**Critical Failure** Rather than the dead, Kothogaz hears the ritual's call and immediately teleports to the primary caster with its Disharmonic Door ability. Primary and secondary casters are afflicted with many-eyed blight.
