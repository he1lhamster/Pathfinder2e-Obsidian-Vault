You perform a complex magical operation on a willing or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] creature or a corpse, delicately cutting into the skull and removing the creature's brain without damaging the organ. If you have an empty [[DATABASE/equipment/Brain Cylinder|brain cylinder]] on hand, you can place the extracted brain into the _brain cylinder_ as part of this ritual (this includes preparing the _brain cylinder_ for use, such as removing a previous brain and filling the cylinder with the preservative fluids required to make it function). Or at the GM's discretion, if you have a nearly completed [[DATABASE/monster/Carrion Golem|carrion golem]] at hand, you can place the extracted brain into the golem. The body of a living creature subjected to this ritual dies, regardless of the ritual's result, as does the extracted brain if it is not placed into a golem or cylinder (or otherwise preserved) within 3 rounds.
**Critical Success** The ritual succeeds on a living creature, or on a corpse that has been dead no longer than 8 hours before the ritual began. If you place the brain into a golem, the golem retains the brain's memories, along with its mental ability scores, alignment, and related skills.
**Success** The ritual succeeds on a living creature or on a corpse that has been dead no longer than 1 hour before the ritual began.
**Failure** The ritual fails and the brain dies.
**Critical Failure** The ritual seems to succeed but warps the brain unrecognizably into a hostile entity, potentially allowing an alien intelligence to seep into it.
