You and the secondary casters weave together spells (and, if [[DATABASE/ancestry/Anadi|anadis]], silk) in a complex ritual that combines magical learning with art, allowing all the participants to share spells they know with one another.
**Success** You or any secondary caster can swap any spell in your spell repertoire for a spell in the spell repertoire of any other participant. This spell can't be a higher level than the ritual's level.
**Failure** None of the participants can swap spells.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and all participants are [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 24 hours and can't reduce their stupefied condition below 1 for 24 hours.
