You consecrate a site to your deity, chanting praises and creating a sacred space. While within the area, worshippers of your deity gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and Perception checks, and creatures anathema to your deity (such as undead for [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]] or [[DATABASE/deity/Sarenrae|Sarenrae]]) take a –1 status penalty to those checks. Attacks made by worshippers of your deity within the area deal 1 damage of one of your deity’s alignment types (your choice); if your deity is true neutral, you don’t gain this benefit.
**Critical Success** The consecration succeeds, and it either lasts for 10 years instead of 1 or covers an area with twice the radius. Occasionally, with your deity’s favor, this might produce an even more amazing effect, such as a permanently consecrated area or the effect covering an entire cathedral.
**Success** The consecration succeeds.
**Failure** The consecration fails.
**Critical Failure** The consecration fails spectacularly and angers your deity, who sends a sign of displeasure. For at least 1 year, further attempts to consecrate the site fail.

**Heightened (7th)** The consecrated area also gains the effects of the [[DATABASE/spell/Dimensional Lock|dimensional lock]] spell, but the effect doesn’t attempt to counteract teleportation by worshippers of your deity. The cost increases to 200 gp × the spell level.
