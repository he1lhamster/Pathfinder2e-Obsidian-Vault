You make an appeal to a powerful devil, asking it to bind some of its subordinates to your service. If you succeed, the devil sends you its choice of one devil whose level is no more than double _infernal pact’s_ level, two devils whose levels are each at least 2 less than double the spell level, or three devils whose levels are each at least 3 less than double the spell level.
**Critical Success** The devils are sent to you and serve you for 1d4 weeks.
**Success** The devils are sent to you and serve you for 1d4 days.
**Failure** Your request is denied.
**Critical Failure** Not only is your request denied, but the powerful devil sends word of its displeasure to your master.
