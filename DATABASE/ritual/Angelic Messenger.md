You transport yourself to either a celestial plane or a world on the Material Plane where worshippers of your patron can be found. You must be of no higher level than double _angelic messenger’s_ spell level.
**Critical Success** As success, but if you've never visited that plane or world before, you appear right in front of the message's intended recipient.
**Success** You arrive on the target plane or world at the last location you visited on that plane or world, or to a random location within 10d10 miles of your message's intended recipient if you've never visited that plane or world before.
**Failure** You don't travel.
**Critical Failure** You accidentally travel to the wrong plane, possibly a dangerous plane.
