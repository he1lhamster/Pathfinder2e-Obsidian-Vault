You anoint the _final blade_ with powdered mithral and grave dirt while speaking softly and carefully to the souls trapped within it. You create a mystical pathway for the souls to escape through and urge them to draw out the magic of the _final blade_ with them as they depart.
**Critical Success** As success, and the souls also grant a boon; the primary and secondary casters gain a +2 status bonus to saves against death and fear effects for the next year.
**Success** The souls escape the [[DATABASE/equipment/Final Blade|final blade]] and peacefully pass on to their eternal rewards, as appropriate for each soul. The [[DATABASE/equipment/Final Blade|final blade]] is no longer magical; it can't store anymore souls and can be destroyed as a normal guillotine.
**Failure** The ritual has no effect.
**Critical Failure** The ritual goes horribly wrong. The souls within the [[DATABASE/equipment/Final Blade|final blade]] are released in a furious rush as a [[DATABASE/monster/Gray Death|gray death]] that does its best to slay the ritual's casters and run amok among the living. The [[DATABASE/equipment/Final Blade|final blade]] retains it abilities and can continue to store souls.
