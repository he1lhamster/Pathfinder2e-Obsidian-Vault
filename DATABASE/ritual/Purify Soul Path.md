You delve inward, spending extensive time contemplating the purity of your own soul and the actions of your past. If you aren't truly penitent, the outcome is always a critical failure.
**Critical Success** You reconcile your misdeeds with your soul path, removing your soulforged corruption. The corruption flaw from your armament no longer affects you. Before your reconciliation is complete, you must perform a special quest or other task in accord with your soul path. If completed during downtime, this task should take no less than 1 week. For 1 month, you receive divine insight just before performing an act that would be anathema to your soul path.
**Success** As critical success, but you gain no special insight regarding its subsequent actions.
**Failure** You don't reconcile and must continue to meditate and redress your misdeeds. Any future _purify soul path_ rituals for the same misdeeds cost half as much and gain a +4 circumstance bonus to the primary check.
