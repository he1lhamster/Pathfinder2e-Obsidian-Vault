**Critical Success** You conjure the div or divs, and they require nothing in return for their service.
**Success** You conjure the div or divs. They are not eager to pursue the task, so they require a favor in return.
**Failure** you don't conjure any divs.
**Critical Failure** You don't conjure any divs, and they send a spiritual backlash that denies your use of any of your innate divine spells for 24 hours. If you are under the effect of any of your innate divine spells, the durations end.
