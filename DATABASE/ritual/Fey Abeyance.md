You ward an area with cold iron bells, protecting it from the influence of the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|first world]]. Fey creatures feel uncomfortable within the area and all physical attacks against them are considered [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]] for the purposes of their Weaknesses and Resistances. Furthermore, you set up bells within 3 squares within the area (usually at entrances). When a fey creature begins its turn in a square containing bells, it takes mental damage equal to its Weakness to cold iron, if any. This damage is nonlethal.
**Critical Success** You may designate up to 6 squares to contain bells.
**Success** The ritual succeeds.
**Failure** The ritual has no effect.
**Critical Failure** The ritual has no effect and attracts the attention of a troublesome fey creature. At the GM's discretion, it might be [[DATABASE/condition/Hostile|hostile]] or merely mischievous.
