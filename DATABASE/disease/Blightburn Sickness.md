# Blightburn Sickness
<span class="item-type">Disease 15</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
Caused by exposure to blightburn crystal, blightburn sickness burns and dissolves the afflicted creature from within. The target can't recover from the disease's drained or sickened condition except by magic. It's typically a 15th-level affliction (DC 32 Fortitude), but exposure to other forms of blightburn can change it.
**Saving Throw** DC 32 Fortitude; **Onset** 1d4 days; **Stage 1** [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] (1 day); **Stage 2** drained 1 and [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]; **Stage 3** drained 2 and sickened 2 (1 week); **Stage 4** drained 3 and sickened 3 (1 month); **Stage 5** increase drained condition by 1 (1 year)
