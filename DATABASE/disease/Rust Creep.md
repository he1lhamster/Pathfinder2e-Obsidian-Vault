Those afflicted by rust creep develop uncomfortable rust-colored bruises on their flesh and endure full-body aches like those one might experience after a long workout. As the affliction progresses, their bodies—as well as the clothing and items they wear or carry—increasingly break down until a painful death occurs. If a character successfully resists contracting rust creep, or recovers from a case of rust creep, they are temporarily immune to future rust creep infections for 24 hours.
