**Source** [[Monsters of Myth]]
Addictive exhaustion results from exposure to [[Kuworsys]] spores, through close proximity with the monster or in fungus-filled pits throughout Kuworsys's lair. At the onset, afflicted creatures find themselves gradually becoming disinterested in life. As the disease worsens, they become hyper-focused on a single activity. As the disease reaches its final stages, sustenance and rest provide no relief for them.
**Saving Throw** Fortitude; creatures with addictive exhaustion can't reduce their [[Sickened]] condition from addictive exhaustion while they have the disease; **Stage 1** The creature is sickened 1. One skill of the creature's choice doesn't suffer the status penalty from this sickened condition to its skill checks (1 day); **Stage 2** As Stage 1, but the creature is sickened 2 and is [[Fatigued]] (5 days); **Stage 3** As Stage 2, but the creature is sickened 3 and has incurable hunger and thirst, in addition to being fatigued (1 day)
