**Steam Cloud** Whenever the steam cart takes collision damage, its engine expels a dense cloud of steam in a 5-foot emanation. The steam cart and all creatures in the steam become [[Concealed]], and creatures outside the steam become concealed to creatures within it. The steam dissipates in 1 round.
