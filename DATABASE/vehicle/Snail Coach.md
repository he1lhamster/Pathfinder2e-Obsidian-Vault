Shaped like its animal namesake, a snail coach is a trolley powered by a combination of magic and alchemical adhesives, with a hard outer shell to protect itself from attacks. The adhesive trail both allows it to climb and leaves a hindrance for pursuing foes.

**Adhesive Secretions** This vehicle secretes an alchemical adhesive that allows it to stick to and climb up solid surfaces. Spaces the snail coach moves through become difficult terrain for 1 round. Any creature that ends their turn on the adhesive must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save or take a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is also [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] for 1 round ([[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC 23).
