On festival days, the people of Hillcross celebrate by launching gliders from the top of the cliffs and riding updrafts through the ravine. Hillcross gliders are made of bone and stretched hide, tied together with sinew, and sealed with a glue made from animal fat.

**Starting Drop** The only way to launch a Hillcross glider is to jump off a steep incline with favorable wind conditions. The glider is uncontrolled and falls 60 feet each round until the pilot successfully [[Take Control]]. If the glider hits the ground before the pilot Takes Control, the pilot and the glider both take falling damage.
