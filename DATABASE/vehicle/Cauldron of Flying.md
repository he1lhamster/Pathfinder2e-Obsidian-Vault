Witches flying about the countryside at night in their magical cauldrons are often merely legends, but the existence of this magical vehicle shows at least some of the legends are true.
 A _cauldron of flying_ can carry only one creature, who stands or crouches in the cauldron and steers it with a ladle, broomstick, or similar implement. The specific implement isn't part of the cauldron and doesn't need to have any particular magic; it simply focuses the pilot's desire to have the cauldron soar into the air and direct it where the pilot wants it to go.
 When not in use as a vehicle, the cauldron can be used to boil food and prepare alchemical ingredients, just like any mundane cauldron. To activate the cauldron, however, it must be empty.
