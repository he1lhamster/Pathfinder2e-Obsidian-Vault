**Starting Drop** The only way to launch a glider is to jump off a steep incline with favorable wind conditions. The glider is uncontrolled and falls 60 feet each round until the pilot successfully Takes Control. If the glider hits the ground before the pilot successfully Takes Control, the pilot and the glider each take falling damage.
