**Wind-Up** (10-minute wind, 10-minute operation, DC 26, standby) Like all clockwork vehicles, a clockwork bumblebee must be wound up in order to operate, and a creature can decrease the operation time by 10 minutes with a successful [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disable Device]] check at the listed DC. A clockwork vehicle can be placed into standby mode by its pilot as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby. You can find more info in the wind-up entry here.
