This clockwork cycle provides most of its mobility via cogs and gears, which allow the cycle to move at a reasonable pace without the need for significant pedaling effort on the part of the pilot. The pilot uses a system of pedals and steering to control the speed and direction of the vehicle. The vehicle comes equipped with two sidecars, one on each side of the pilot.
