A planar skiff is a flat-bottomed ship designed to travel the Great Beyond. A wide variety of skiffs course the planes, with designs incorporating their home planes' fashions and materials. Their magical sails allow them to catch planar currents, and their wards protect travelers as they move across planar boundaries. To allow travel to multiple planes, a _planar skiff_ can have multiple planar keys installed (including items like a _[[Cipher of the Elemental Planes]]_). Installing or removing one takes 10 minutes. A planar skiff is typically built with one planar key from its plane of manufacture and a second for a destination plane.

**Speed** fly 50 feet (magical)
**Collision** 9d10 (DC 32)
**Adaptation Aura** ([[Aura]]) 10 feet. The vehicle has a warding aura that protects its passengers. Creatures and objects in the aura gain resistance 10 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, sonic, vitality, and void damage. They are also protected from severe cold, severe heat, extreme cold, and extreme heat. The aura also provides breathable air for all passengers, though this air can still become filled with smoke and similar substances.
 **Journey the Planes** (10 minutes) The pilot locks onto a plane, using one of the vehicle's planar keys as a focus. A canal of planar energy from the destination plane appears ahead of the ship. The pilot spends 10 minutes navigating the passage, then attempts a piloting check (typically DC 34). On a success, the vehicle casts [[Plane Shift]], transporting itself and all passengers and cargo to the destination plane as it reaches the terminus of the canal. The pilot is considered the target of the spell for the purposes of determining the location at which the vehicle arrives on the plane. The skiff can't _interplanar teleport_ again for 8 hours.
 **Planar Evacuation** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (move, reckless) The pilot overcharges one of the vehicle's planar keys, forcing an emergency transport of the ship. The pilot attempts a DC 44 piloting check. On a success, the vehicle casts _interplanar teleport_ as noted in Journey the Planes. (The pilot can't succeed on the check if the vessel is unable to _interplanar teleport_.) This process severely taxes the vehicle, and it can't _interplanar teleport_ again for 1d4 days.
