A sand diver is a vaguely scorpion-shaped vehicle that uses alchemical reactions to propel itself. The tail-like structure acts as a heat sink and releases alchemical fumes behind the diver as it burrows. Instead of pincers, it has two burrowing mechanisms in front that allow it to dig through sand.

**Shard Trail** A sand diver can only burrow through sand, using the heat and flame from its alchemical core to slowly dig its way through. The alchemical fumes left behind become trapped belowground as it Burrows, temporarily catalyzing fragments of sand into a glass-like byproduct. Creatures that Burrow through a space this vehicle has Burrowed through within the last 24 hours take 1d12 piercing damage from the shards (DC 17 basic Fortitude save). A creature that continues Burrowing through a stretch of the same space the sand diver recently Burrowed through must continue to attempt this save the first time each round that it Burrows through the shards.
 **Sluggish** This vehicle must move twice its length for each 90-degree turn it makes.
