A clockwork borer is essentially a huge [[Adamantine]] drill attached to a large wheeled carriage. The clockwork gears within move the borer itself and spin the drill, allowing it to burrow through loose material quickly and even through solid stone at a slower rate.

**Adamantine Drill** While most burrow Speeds only allow a creature or vehicle to move through loose dirt or earth, this vehicle is equipped with an adamantine drill and can burrow through bedrock and stone at a rate of 5 feet per minute.
 **Pivoting Seats** This vehicle's seats are mounted on a weighted platform that pivots as the vehicle moves, automatically adjusting position with gravity. Seated creatures remain upright no matter the position or angle of the vehicle.
 **Sluggish** Because it is sluggish, this vehicle must move twice its length for each 90-degree turn it makes.
 **Wind-Up** 10 minutes of wind-up, 1 hour of operational time, DC 26, standby
