**Maneuverable** With a full complement of skilled rowers, a rowed galley can turn swiftly, turn in place, and even row backwards. Each 90-degree turn made in less than a vehicle length costs 5 extra feet of movement. It can row backwards no faster than half its speed, and it can’t turn while rowing backwards.
