The helepolis uses both pushed propulsion and turned propulsion to turn a capstan. Turned propulsion uses the same rules as rowed propulsion. Pushed propulsion uses the same rules as pulled.

**Sluggish** This vehicle must move twice its length for each 90-degree turn it makes.
 **Tiered** A helepolis has six levels. The crew operate at the bottom tier, turning a giant capstan. There's room remaining on that tier for up to six passengers (enough for a full heavy ballista siege crew; see Weaponry). Each of the remaining five levels carries up to 60 passengers. The tiers are specifically meant to be protective and give those within the helepolis greater cover (or standard cover if the helepolis is broken). A massive ladder runs diagonally through the center of the helepolis, from the front of the top tier to the rear of the bottom tier. The ladder is wide enough for two crew or passengers to climb simultaneously.
 **Weaponry** The siege tower is loaded to the brim with siege weapons—typically bristling with heavy ballistas on its first and second tiers and ballistas on its third, fourth, and fifth. The Price of these weapons is included in that of the helepolis. When building a helepolis, you can choose to replace any of these with other siege weapons with a lower Price. If you want a more expensive siege weapon, you must Craft it separately. Because of the helepolis's structure, any siege weapon in it must launch its payload straight ahead. For instance, a ballista or springald could function in a helepolis, but not a catapult or trebuchet. Passengers of the helepolis can crew these siege weapons.
