 **Tiered** A siege tower has five levels. The bottom level houses the crew, and each higher level carries up to 10 passengers. The tiers are specifically meant to be protective and give those within the siege tower greater cover (or standard cover if the siege tower is broken). Each tier is connected to the one above it by a 7-foot ladder.
 The siege tower has a corvus at its highest tier: a vertical bridge that can be lowered to allow creatures to cross gaps. Lowering the corvus takes a total of 3 Interact actions. Moving the siege tower while the corvus is lowered is highly dangerous, especially for anyone on the corvus. When it's open, creatures in the top tier don't have cover from the side with the corvus, and creatures on the lowered corvus don't have cover except from below.
