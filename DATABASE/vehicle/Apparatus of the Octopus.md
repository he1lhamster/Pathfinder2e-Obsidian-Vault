This apparatus, which is shaped like an octopus (or more rarely, a squid or other aquatic creature), uses almost entirely magical propulsion. Clockwork parts make up the controls and mechanisms to improve some of the functionality, but magic moves the vehicles' cogs and gears. While it needs only a pilot, it can optionally hold a second crew member, which can be useful if the second crew member controls the apparatus's hands or eyes.

**Manipulate Hands** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (Interact) A crew member operates a lever set up like a joystick, allowing that crew member to extend and manipulate the apparatus's hands. While the hands can't attack and can't perform fine actions such as [[DATABASE/action/Disable a Device|Disabling a Device]], [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Stealing]] something, or opening the stopper on a potion bottle, but they can grasp and hold up to 50 Bulk.
 **Open Eyes** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (Interact) A crew member pulls a lever to open the apparatus's eyes, which shine bright light within 20 feet and dim light for the next 20 feet. A crew member can take this action again to close the eyes.
 **Open Portholes** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (Interact) A crew member pulls a lever to open two portholes, allowing the crew to see outside the apparatus and other creatures to see into it. A crew member can take this action again to close the portholes.
 **Submersible** The apparatus of the octopus can protect its crew and passengers from water pressure to a maximum depth of 5,000 feet and contains enough air for 12 hours for a pilot alone or 6 hours for a pilot and passenger or crew member.
