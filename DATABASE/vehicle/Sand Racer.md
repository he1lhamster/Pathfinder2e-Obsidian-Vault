**Crew** 1 pilot; **Passengers** 1
**Piloting Check** [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Driving Lore]] (DC 30), [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] (DC 35), or [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] (DC 36)

**Speed** 90 feet (thasteron)
**Collision** 10d6 bludgeoning and 6d6 fire (DC 30)
**Burning Exhaust** <span class="action-icon">2</span> Attempt a two-action Piloting check to [[DATABASE/action/Drive|Drive]] the sand racer.
**Critical Success** The sand racer moves up to its Speed and can turn normally. Choose up to two creatures that the sand racer was adjacent to when it began this movement. Both of those creatures take 6d6 fire damage from the sand racer's burning exhaust (DC 30 basic Reflex save).
**Success** As critical success, but choose only one creature.
**Failure** As success, but the creature gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its Reflex save, and the sand racer moves its Speed in a straight line.
**Critical Failure** You fail to blast any creatures with the burning exhaust. The sand racer moves its Speed in a straight line and becomes uncontrolled.
 **Exploratory Kit** Sand racers were built to aid in long-distance exploration of Akiton's sandy wastelands, and have storage capacity for 14 days of [[DATABASE/equipment/Rations|rations]] for a Medium creature and 14 days of fuel. They also have a small storage compartment in the front designed to store a [[DATABASE/equipment/Repair Kit|repair kit]] and replacement parts for the more delicate pieces of machinery.
 **Speed Boost** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per 10 minutes; **Effect** The pilot triggers an injection of thasteron directly into the sand racer's engine to briefly increase its speed. For 1 round the sand racer's Speed becomes 180 feet, all piloting checks with the sand racer gain the reckless trait, and the pilot gains a +2 circumstance to any [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or piloting checks made to navigate specific challenges. A speed boost is terribly inefficient, and consumes a day's worth of fuel.
