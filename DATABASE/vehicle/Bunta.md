This hand-woven coracle appears large enough to hold only a single person. When you pilot the boat, however, you can take on up to a dozen passengers, which ride in your soul. While there, their bodies and equipment are absorbed into you—they are aware of everything you sense and can communicate telepathically with you or any other passengers, but otherwise can't act except to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] and use actions that require only the use of their mind (as determined by the GM). They can exit your soul, or you can remove any number of them using a single action—which has the concentrate trait—causing them to appear in a space adjacent to _Bunta_. If you leave _Bunta_ or are killed, any creatures in your soul immediately exit your body into the nearest available space. If you leave _Bunta_ after piloting it, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to store the boat in your soul. You can remove it from your soul into an adjacent square with another such action. If _Bunta_ takes enough damage to destroy it, it bursts into golden mist, then reforms over 24 hours in its last pilot's soul.

**Spirit Ship** _Bunta_ can be damaged by spells like [[DATABASE/spell/Spirit Blast|spirit blast]] that damage a creature's spirit directly, and such effects ignore _Bunta's_ hardness.

**Collision** secret of souls
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> command, envision, Interact **Requirements** You are piloting _Bunta_; **Effect** A silver river flows from your heart, traveling forward in a line that flows around obstacles as if it were water. If _Bunta_ travels at least its speed along the river each round for 10 minutes, you arrive at another plane as if you cast [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|plane shift]]. You arrive in a destination you specify, or a random location if you don't have a choice. If _Bunta_ ever does not travel at least its Speed in a round, you can disrupt this activation. If you continue, you have a 1% cumulative chance of ending up in a random extraplanar location for each round that _Bunta_ did not travel at least its Speed, to a maximum of a 60% chance if _Bunta_ didn't travel at least its Speed for the full 10 minutes. As long as you remain on _Bunta_, you are protected from any harmful effects of the plane's environment.
 **Secret of Souls** You pilot _Bunta_ into a creature's soul, finding and restoring its true nature. _Bunta_ attempts to counteract all magical effects on the creature. Its counteract level is 20, with a counteract modifier of +40.
 **Destruction** _Bunta_ can only be permanently destroyed if Old-Mage Jatembe unweaves it, then submerges each reed in the River Styx at the base of Pharasma's Spire.
