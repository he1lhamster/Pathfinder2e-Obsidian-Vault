The gold, gems, and other embellishments that adorn this flying sphere emit a sparkling resplendence capable of enthralling creatures.

A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune for 1 hour. Each time Prismatic Defense is activated, the area of Captivating Wealth is reduced by 10 feet for 1 hour, to a minimum of 0 feet.
 **Protective Barrier** While the swirling rings of the vehicle don't fully cover the pilot, they offer incredible protection, magically maintaining the temperature within and ablating physical attacks.
