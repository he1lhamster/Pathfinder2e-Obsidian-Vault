**Collision** 2d10 (DC 19)
**Jump Jet** The firework pogo moves exclusively via [[Leap]]. For each action spent to Drive, the pogo Leaps 20 feet horizontally or 10 feet vertically.
 **Unstable Launch** When the pilot uses a 3-action activity to recklessly Drive the firework pogo, it emits a burst of flames on launch that deals 3d6 fire damage to the pilot, the pogo itself, and each creature in a 10-foot radius (DC 19 basic Reflex save).
