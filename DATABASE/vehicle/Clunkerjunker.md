A favorite of [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblins]], a clunkerjunker is essentially an armored cart built out of junk that uses volatile flammable chemicals, explosions, and alchemical reactions to propel itself bumpily along. While the initial idea is impressive and the cost of creating one is surprisingly low, these junkers, unfortunately, have a strong tendency to malfunction, and they're always one bad bump away from disaster.

**Fall Apart** When this vehicle takes physical damage the pilot must attempt a DC 11 flat check (or a DC 20 flat check when it takes a critical hit). On a failure, the armored hull fractures and the vehicle loses its Hardness and takes a –4 circumstance penalty to AC.
 **Smog** ([[DATABASE/monsterability/Aura|aura]], [[DATABASE/domain/Fire Domain|fire]]) 10 feet. Whenever this vehicle is being piloted, it continually emits a thin haze of smoke and chemicals. Creatures in the aura (including the pilot and passengers) take a –1 circumstance penalty to visual Perception checks.
 **Volatile Flamethrower** <span class="action-icon">3</span> ([[DATABASE/domain/Fire Domain|fire]]) The pilot performs a three-action activity on their turn to vent alchemical fire out the sides of this vehicle. This requires three flasks of [[DATABASE/equipment/Alchemist's Fire|minor alchemist's fire]], which the pilot loads into the vent as part of the activity. The pilot must then attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a success, creatures adjacent to this vehicle take 1d8 fire damage (DC 15 basic Reflex save). On a failure, it backfires, dealing 1d8 fire damage to the pilot and any passengers, with no save.
