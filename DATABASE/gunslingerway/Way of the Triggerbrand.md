# Way of the Triggerbrand

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]
You prefer firearms that work well as weapons in both melee and ranged combat, particularly those that allow you to exercise a bit of style and flair. You might be a survivor who cobbled your weapon together from the City of Smog's street scrap or a noble wielder of a master smith's bespoke commission for duels among Alkenstar's elite. In addition to the combination weapons presented in _Pathfinder Guns & Gears_, you gain access to the [[DATABASE/weapon/Triggerbrand|triggerbrand]] combination weapon.

You can Interact to draw a combination weapon and set it to melee or ranged mode. On your first turn, your movement and ranged attacks don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement or a ranged attack (such as [[DATABASE/monsterability/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]]).

Should foes parry your blade or dodge your bullets? Neither— they should be watching their purse. Make a melee Strike with your combination weapon, and then attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] check with a –5 penalty to [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]] from your target; you can't Steal closely guarded objects or objects that would take a long time to pilfer. You don't need a free hand to attempt to Steal something in this manner. If your Thievery check succeeds, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against your ranged attacks until the start of your next turn, and you don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement or a ranged attack. These effects occur even if your target has no objects to Steal.

Your foes are but dross from which you carve and shoot your legend. Make a melee Strike and then a ranged Strike with a combination weapon, both against the same enemy; you don't need to change modes to do so. If the melee Strike hits, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the attack roll with the ranged Strike. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you've made both attacks. If both Strikes hit, you deal an additional 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] to the enemy, and they're [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until this persistent bleed damage ends.
