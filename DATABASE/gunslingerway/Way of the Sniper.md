# Way of the Sniper

**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
You practice a style of shooting that relies on unerring accuracy and perfect placement of your first shot. You keep hidden or at a distance, staying out of the fray and bringing unseen death to your foes.
**Slinger's Reload** [[Covered Reload]]
**Deeds** _Initial_ [[One Shot, One Kill]]; _Advanced_ [[Vital Shot]]; _Greater_ [[Ghost Shot]]
**Way Skill** [[Stealth]]

## Slinger's Reload

### [[Covered Reload]] <span class="action-icon">1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Gunslinger</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]

---
You duck into a safe position or minimize your profile while reloading to make your next attack. Either [[Take Cover]] or attempt to [[Hide]], then Interact to reload. As normal, you must meet the requirements to Take Cover or Hide; you must be [[Prone]], benefiting from cover, or near a feature that allows you to Take Cover, and you need to be benefiting from cover or [[Concealed]] to a creature to Hide from that creature.

## Initial Deed

### [[One Shot, One Kill]] <span class="action-icon">4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Gunslinger</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Trigger** You roll [[Stealth]] for initiative.

Your first shot is the deadliest. Interact to draw a firearm or crossbow. On your first turn, your first Strike with that weapon deals an additional 1d6 precision damage. This precision damage increases to 2d6 at 9th level and 3d6 at 15th level.

## Advanced Deed<span class="item-type">9th</span>

### [[Vital Shot]] <span class="action-icon">2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Gunslinger</span>

---
Your careful shot against an unsuspecting opponent pierces a vital artery or organ. Make a ranged Strike. If the target is [[Flat-Footed]], the Strike deals an extra die of weapon damage, and the foe takes [[Persistent Damage]] equal to the amount of precision damage from your [[One Shot, One Kill]].

## Greater Deed<span class="item-type">15th</span>

### [[Ghost Shot]] <span class="action-icon">1</span>

Make a firearm or crossbow Strike. If you're [[Hidden]] from or [[Undetected]] by the target, the Strike adds the additional precision damage from [[One Shot, One Kill]]; if you would already receive that additional damage on the Strike, the effects aren't cumulative. If you were undetected or [[Unnoticed]] by any creatures, you're now hidden from them instead, as the origin of the attack is clear.
