# Way of the Spellshot

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
Prerequisites: Must be a [[DATABASE/class_/Gunslinger|gunslinger]].
You've learned the intricacies of magic and technology, blending the two together with deadly results. You combine a knowledge of arcane theories with a strong connection to your chosen weapon that allows you to manifest unique effects, though your knowledge doesn't extend as far as actual spellcasting. You can imbue energy into your weapon and conjure bullets from thin air. As you progress, you eventually learn to phase bullets through walls or even to teleport yourself along the path of your bullets.
You must select [[DATABASE/feat/Spellshot Dedication|Spellshot Dedication]] from the [[DATABASE/archetype/Spellshot|Spellshot]] archetype as your 2nd-level class feat.

You unleash a small surge of magical energy into your weapon, shrouding the bullet with potential energy and granting it the ability to deal energy damage to your foes to exploit their weaknesses. You can Interact to draw a ranged weapon. On your first three Strikes of this encounter with a firearm or crossbow, you deal an additional 1 acid, cold, fire or electricity damage. You choose which damage type to deal as part of making each Strike.

You imprint a bullet with a field of abjuration built upon your magical signature, disrupting the magic of whatever it hits. Make a firearm or crossbow Strike against a foe you can see. If you hit, you attempt to counteract a spell effect active on the target (your choice, or the highest-level effect if you don't choose). Your counteract level is equal to half your level (rounded up), and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC – 10.
