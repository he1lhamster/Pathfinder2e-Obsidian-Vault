# Way of the Drifter

**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
You're a wanderer traveling from land to land with your gun and a melee weapon as company. Maybe you learned to fight with blade and pistol as a Shackles pirate, mastered the hand cannon and katana in Minkai, or practiced with a hatchet and clan pistol in Dongun Hold. You win battles by relying on mobility and flexible use of your weapons.
**Slinger's Reload** [[Reloading Strike]]
**Deeds** _Initial_ [[Into the Fray]]; _Advanced_ [[Finish the Job]]; _Greater_ [[Drifter's Wake]]
**Way Skill** [[Acrobatics]]

## Slinger's Reload

### [[Reloading Strike]] <span class="action-icon">1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Gunslinger</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Requirements** You're wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand, and your other hand either wields a one-handed melee weapon or is empty.

---
You make a melee attack and then reload your gun in one fluid movement. Strike an opponent within reach with your one-handed melee weapon (or, if your other hand is empty, with an unarmed attack), and then Interact to reload. You don't need a free hand to reload in this way.

## Initial Deed

### [[Into the Fray]] <span class="action-icon">4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Gunslinger</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Trigger** You roll initiative.

---
You know trouble can lurk around every corner, and your hands never stray far from your holsters. You can Interact to draw a one-handed ranged weapon and can then Interact to draw a one-handed melee weapon. As your first action on your first turn, you can Stride as a free action toward an enemy you can perceive. If you can't perceive any enemies or can't end your movement closer to one, you can't use this Stride.

## Advanced Deed<span class="item-type">9th</span>

### [[Finish the Job]] <span class="action-icon">1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Gunslinger</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Requirements** On your last action, you failed (but didn't critically fail) a Strike with a firearm or crossbow you're holding in one hand, and your other hand is either wielding a melee weapon or empty.

---
Your last attack failed, but it set you up for another. Make a Strike with your other hand, using a one-handed melee weapon or unarmed attack. This Strike uses the same multiple attack penalty as the Strike that failed on the last action. Afterward, increase your multiple attack penalty normally.

## Greater Deed<span class="item-type">15th</span>

### [[Drifter's Wake]] <span class="action-icon">3</span>

<span class="item-trait">Gunslinger</span>

---
You drift across the battlefield, striking down foes as you go. You Stride, and you can Strike up to three times at any points during your movement. Each attack must target a different enemy and must be made with a one-handed firearm, crossbow, melee weapon, or unarmed attack. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you've made all your attacks. Your movement doesn't trigger reactions.
