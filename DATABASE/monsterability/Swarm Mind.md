# Swarm Mind

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
This monster doesn’t have a single mind (typically because it’s a swarm of smaller creatures), and is immune to mental effects that target only a specific number of creatures. It is still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area.
