# Constant Spells

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
A constant spell affects the monster without the monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited. If a constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can reactivate it by spending the normal spellcasting actions the spell requires.
