# Lifesense

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
Lifesense allows a monster to sense the vital essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. The sense can distinguish between the positive energy animating living creatures and the negative energy animating undead creatures, much as sight distinguishes colors.
