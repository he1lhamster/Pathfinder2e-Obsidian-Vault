# Darkvision

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level _[[DATABASE/spell/Darkness|darkness]]_ spell, block normal darkvision. A monster with greater darkvision, however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.
