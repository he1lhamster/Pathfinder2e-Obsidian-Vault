# Light Blindness

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
When first exposed to bright light, the monster is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] until the end of its next turn. After this exposure, light doesn’t blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in darkness. However, as long as the monster is in an area of bright light, it’s [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]].
