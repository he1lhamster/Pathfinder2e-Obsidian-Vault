# Grab <span class="action-icon">1</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
**Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]]; **Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.
 The monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn.
