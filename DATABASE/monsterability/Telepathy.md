# Telepathy

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
(aura, divination, magical) A monster with telepathy can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn’t give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.
