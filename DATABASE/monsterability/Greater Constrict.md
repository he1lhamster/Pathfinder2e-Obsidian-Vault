**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
The monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save falls [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], and a creature that succeeds is then temporarily immune to falling [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] from Greater Constrict for 1 minute.
