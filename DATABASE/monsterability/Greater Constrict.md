**Source** [[Bestiary]]
The monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save falls [[Unconscious]], and a creature that succeeds is then temporarily immune to falling [[Unconscious]] from Greater Constrict for 1 minute.
