**Source** [[Bestiary]]
Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to buck off unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless the mounts are spooked or mistreated. **Trigger** A creature [[Mount]] or uses the [[Command an Animal]] action while riding the monster. **Effect** The triggering creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw against the listed DC or fall off the creature and land [[Prone]]. If the save is a critical failure, the triggering creature also takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage in addition to the normal damage for the fall.
