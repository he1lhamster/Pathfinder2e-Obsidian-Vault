# Regeneration

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]] condition never increases beyond [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying 3]] as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying 4]].
