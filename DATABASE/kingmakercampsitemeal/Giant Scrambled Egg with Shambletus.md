This meal is traditionally prepared with [[Roc]] eggs, with only a small portion prepared with special herbs and the uncommon mushrooms known as shambletus. The eggs that aren't prepared in this way are then served to the servants, while the aristocracy enjoys the main dish. It's only these portions that provide the following benefits— the “leftovers” merely provide nourishment.
**Critical Success** The meal grants the eater a +2 status bonus to saving throws for 24 hours
**Success** The meal grants the eater a +1 status bonus to saving throws for 24 hours.
**Critical Failure** The meal is disappointing. The eater suffers a –2 status penalty to saving throws against emotion effects for 24 hours or until they critically succeed at such a saving throw, whichever comes first.
