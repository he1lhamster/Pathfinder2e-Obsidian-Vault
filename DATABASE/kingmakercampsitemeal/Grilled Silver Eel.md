When a silver eel is grilled with certain spices, its meat can help to bolster your deceptive ability, as well as your ability to slip past enemies in combat.
**Critical Success** The meal grants the eater a +1 status bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]] and to [[DATABASE/action/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] for 24 hours.
**Success** The meal grants the eater a +1 status bonus to Tumble Through for 24 hours.
