[[Purple Worm]] meat is not particularly flavorful. Yet when one takes a dose of the worm's poison and distills it in a way that reduces its toxicity, the hearty purple soup that results can be a significant panacea against poisons and diseases.
**Critical Success** The meal grants immunity to diseases and poisons of level 15 or lower. In addition, the meal grants a +3 status bonus to saving throws against poison and disease effects. Any saving throws attempted against [[Cave Worm]] poison or any poison of level 15 or lower are rolled twice, using the higher result as the actual result; this is a fortune effect.
**Success** As critical success, except that the fortune effect only applies to cave worm poison, not to other poisons of level 15 or lower.
**Critical Failure** Instead of protecting from poison, the soup is poison itself. The eater becomes [[Enfeebled]]; every 24 hours, this enfeebled condition diminishes by 1. This is a poison effect.
