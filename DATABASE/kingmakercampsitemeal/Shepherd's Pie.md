# Shepherd's Pie<span class="item-type">Meal 2</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Recipe Price** 2 gp
**Ingredients** 4 basic
**Preparation** DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Cooking Lore]] or DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]]
**Favorite Meal** For the next 24 hours, the eater's healing ability is enhanced. Whenever they recover Hit Points with a healing effect, they restore 1 additional Hit Point. If an effect would heal them more than once, such as [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing]], the additional Hit Point applies only the first time they're healed

This simple but filling meal provides ample amounts of physical nutrition and mental comfort.
**Critical Success** The meal augments physical recovery. When the eater recovers Hit Points from resting during this camping session, they recover an additional 4d6 Hit Points. If the eater was [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], they reduce their drained condition by 2 points rather than by 1.
**Success** The meal augments the body's ability to recover. When the eater recovers Hit Points from resting during this camping session, they recover an additional 2d6 Hit Points.
**Critical Failure** The meal doesn't sit well. When the eater rests during this camping session, they regain only half the amount of Hit Points from resting that they normally would have.
