Normally a treat limited to areas where ice is abundant, this version of the recipe utilizes the ability to cast spells that cause cold damage to create a deliciously close approximation of ice cream while camping. When you use the Cook Special Meal activity to create ice cream, you must cast 1 cold spell—typically, [[DATABASE/spell/Ray of Frost|ray of frost]] is utilized.
**Critical Success** The ice cream is perfect. The eater receives a +1 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] checks for 24 hours.
**Success** As critical success, but the bonus ends when the eater begins daily preparations.
**Critical Failure** The ice cream is too cold, too sweet, or both. In addition to not gaining any special benefit from the meal, disappointment causes the eater to take a –1 status penalty to saving throws against emotion effects for 24 hours or until the character achieves a critical success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, whichever comes first.
