This thick stew looks unappetizing, with its tar-like black broth and strangely colored chunks of meat.
**Critical Success** The meal grants a +3 status bonus to saves against curse and poison effects. In addition, the next time the eater is damaged, they gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing 10]]; this fast healing lasts until the eater dies, is healed to its maximum hit points, or for 1 minute, whichever comes first, after which the fast healing effect ends.
**Success** The meal grants a +3 status bonus to saves against curse and poison effects.
**Critical Failure** The meal imparts a fragment of the linnorm death curse on the eater, who becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]] for 24 hours. This is a curse effect.
