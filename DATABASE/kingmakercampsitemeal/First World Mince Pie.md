This meal is infused with the magical, life-giving energies of the First World itself. The exact ingredients for this meal are never the same, and the cook can never be sure exactly what they might be inspired to put into the pie until they begin cooking, as the choice of ingredients must be somewhat influenced by chance and whimsy. Note that this meal is an apex item, and you can't gain an ability score increase from more than one apex item at a time.
**Critical Success** Increase a random ability score by 2 or to 18, whichever results in the higher score. This effect persists as long as the eater remains in the First World or an associated demiplane, or until they gain an effect from another special meal, whichever comes first.
**Success** As critical success, but the effect lasts no longer than 24 hours.
**Critical Failure** Something in the meal clashes with the eater's body, mind, and soul. When they roll an initiative check at the start of any combat, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, they become [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 minute. This effect lasts as long as they remain in the First World (or an associated demiplane) or for 24 hours, whichever comes second. This is a curse effect.
