A classic meal of meat, mushrooms, and root vegetables, this roast meal is served amid helpings of thick gravy.
**Critical Success** The eater gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to their level, lasting up to 24 hours.
**Success** As critical success, but the temporary Hit Points last only until the eater begins their daily preparations.
**Critical Failure** The hunter's roast is more than unpalatable— it's poisonous! The eater takes 2d6 poison damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] until they get a full night's rest. This is a poison effect.
