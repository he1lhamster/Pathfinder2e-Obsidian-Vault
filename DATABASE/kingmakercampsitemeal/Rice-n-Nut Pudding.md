A properly cooked serving of rice-n-nut pudding requires a bit of understanding of the nature of arcane magic, since drawing upon this knowledge while the meal simmers not only improves the taste but adds a bit of extra focus for spellcasters of any tradition.
**Critical Success** The meal grants a +1 status bonus to Arcana checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Identify Magic|Identify Magic]] and to [[DATABASE/action/Learn a Spell|Learn a Spell]] for the next 24 hours.
**Success** The meal grants a +1 status bonus to Arcana checks made to Identify Magic and to Learn a spell for the remainder of the camping session.
**Critical Failure** The meal is filling, but its magical influence accidentally makes the eater more susceptible to certain magical effects which are drawn to the eater like iron filings to a magnet. The eater suffers a –1 status penalty to Reflex saves against spells for the next 24 hours. This is a curse effect.
