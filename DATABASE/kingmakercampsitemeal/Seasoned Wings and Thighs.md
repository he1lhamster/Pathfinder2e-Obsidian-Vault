While the exact level of spice in this meal depends on the cook, many pride in making the wings and thighs almost unpalatably spicy. Part of the tradition of cooking this meal involves roasting the meat with magical fire (produce flame is typically used), and the process infuses the resulting meal with some of that burning magic.
**Critical Success** The meal grants the eater resistance to fire 10 for the remainder of the camping session and resistance to fire 5 for the next 24 hours.
**Success** The meal grants the eater resistance to fire 10 for the remainder of the camping session.
**Critical Failure** The wings and thighs are too hot! The eater is forced to spit them out and gains no nourishment from the meal. Additionally, they are [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 2]] until they get a full night's rest, and they cannot reduce this condition's value naturally, but it's a poison effect.
