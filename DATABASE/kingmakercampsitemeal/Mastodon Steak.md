Prepared correctly, mastodon steaks are said to impart the eater with an echo of the megafauna's strength.
**Critical Success** The meal restores 7d8 Hit Points and reduces the eater's [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy]], [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]], and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] conditions by 2.
**Success** The meal restores 4d8 Hit Points and reduces one of the eater's clumsy, drained, enfeebled, or stupefied conditions by 2 (if the eater suffers from more than one, determine which one is reduced randomly).
**Critical Failure** The meal seems to take forever to digest. The eater becomes clumsy 2. This condition is reduced to clumsy 1 after the eater gets a night's rest and does their daily preparations, and is removed entirely after 24 hours. This is a poison effect.
