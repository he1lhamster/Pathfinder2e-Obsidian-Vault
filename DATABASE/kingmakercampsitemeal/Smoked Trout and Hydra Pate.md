Many prefer to spread smoked trout and hydra pate on bread or crackers or use it as a dip for vegetables.
**Critical Success** For the next 24 hours, the eater treats light armor they're at least trained in as if the armor had the comfort trait and gain a +1 status bonus to Fortitude saves.
**Success** As success, but the benefits persist only until the end of this camping session.
**Critical Failure** The meal was prepared poorly, and as such the eater gains no nutritional value from it. Worse, the aches and pains they endure cause them to become [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] until they've had a full night of rest. This is a poison effect.
