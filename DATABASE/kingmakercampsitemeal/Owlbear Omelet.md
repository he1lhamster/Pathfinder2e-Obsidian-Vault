An owlbear omelet can technically be made from any sort of egg, but many consider such meals made with anything other than genuine owlbear eggs to be a farce.
**Critical Success** The meal grants a +1 status bonus to one- handed melee Strike damage rolls for 24 hours.
**Success** The meal grants a +1 status bonus to one-handed melee Strike damage rolls for the remainder of the camping session.
**Critical Failure** The owlbear omelet continues to fight like a monster, even in the eater's belly. They suffer a –1 status penalty to melee Strikes for the next 24 hours. This is a poison effect.
