The freshwater oysters that grow in and around the Tuskwater have long been said to help one see into other realities or to understand secrets beyond normal reach.
**Critical Success** The meal grants a +1 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Identify Magic|Identify Magic]], [[DATABASE/action/Learn a Spell|Learn a Spell]], and [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] for 24 hours.
**Success** The meal grants a +1 status bonus to Occultism checks made to Identify Magic, Learn a Spell, and Recall Knowledge until the eater begins daily preparations.
**Critical Failure** The poorly prepared oysters cause mild but distracting hallucinations, resulting in a –1 status penalty to Perception checks for 24 hours. This is a poison effect.
