You have learned limited divine magic from your Red Mantis training. You gain the [[DATABASE/action/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] activity. You’re a prepared spellcaster, able to prepare two cantrips and one 1st-level spell each day. You prepare these spells from a Red Mantis assassin spellbook, similar to a wizard’s, containing three cantrips and two 1st-level spells. All the spells in your Red Mantis assassin spellbook, from this and later feats, must be either transmutation or illusion spells from the arcane spell list or a spell from the following list: [[DATABASE/spell/Clairaudience|clairaudience]], [[DATABASE/spell/Clairvoyance|clairvoyance]], [[DATABASE/spell/Darkness|darkness]], [[DATABASE/spell/Dimension Door|dimension door]], [[DATABASE/spell/Modify Memory|modify memory]], [[DATABASE/spell/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]], [[DATABASE/spell/Paralyze|paralyze]], [[DATABASE/spell/See Invisibility|see invisibility]], [[DATABASE/spell/True Strike|true strike]]. Regardless of their usual magical tradition, your Red Mantis assassin spells are divine spells, as are any Red Mantis focus spells you gain.
 You can prepare two cantrips and one 1st-level spell each day from those found in your Red Mantis assassin spellbook. You’re trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for casting divine spells. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.
