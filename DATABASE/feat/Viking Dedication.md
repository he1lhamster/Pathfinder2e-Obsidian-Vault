Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm. You're trained in [[Lore]]. When moving through water using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success for your [[Athletics]] check to [[Swim]], you get a critical success instead.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the viking archetype.
