The landscape fills with monumental filaments of metal. The needles lance into a cube 30 feet on a side within 500 feet. Each creature in the area takes 13d6 piercing damage, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. Each creature that fails its save is impaled, becoming [[Immobilized]] until it [[Escape]] (the DC is your class DC); a creature that critically failed is also [[Off-Guard]] as long as it's impaled.
 The hell remains until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. Using this impulse again ends any previous one. The first time you Sustain it each round, lightning crisscrosses the needles. Each creature in the area takes 3d12 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. Squares in the area are hazardous terrain. A creature takes 6 piercing damage for every square of the area it moves through.

**Level (20th)** The initial damage is 17d6, and the hazardous terrain damage is 7.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Metal:**

Effects with the metal trait conjure or manipulate metal. Those that manipulate metal have no effect in an area without metal. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of metal or have a connection to magical metal.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
