You’ve learned how to cast many of your spells without speaking the words of power you would normally need to provide. If the next action you use is Casting a Spell that has a verbal component and at least one other component, you can remove the verbal component. This makes the spell quieter and allows you to cast it in areas where sound can’t carry. However, the spell still has visual manifestations, so this doesn’t make the spell any less obvious to someone who sees you casting it. When you use Silent Spell, you can choose to gain the benefits of Conceal Spell, and you don’t need to attempt a Deception check because the spell has no verbal components.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
