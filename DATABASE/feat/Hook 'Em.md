The Salt Breakers learned to use whatever they could during the Vidric Revolution, and they quickly mastered the art of making a rope into a useful tool in combat. You take hold of a nearby rope, throw a rope from your hand, or fire a grappling weapon at a solid surface—and then swing up to twice your Speed. If you end your movement next to an enemy, attempt an [[Athletics]] check to [[Grapple]] that enemy, tying them up in your rope.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
