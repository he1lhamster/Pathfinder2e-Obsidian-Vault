Your spell shrouds you in a billowing cloud. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that targets you, you surround yourself in a 15-foot emanation of dense magical mist that lasts until the start of your next turn. All creatures within the cloud become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud are concealed to creatures within it.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
