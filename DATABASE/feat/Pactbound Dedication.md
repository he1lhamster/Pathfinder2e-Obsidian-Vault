# Pactbound Dedication <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Monsters of Myth|Monsters of Myth]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Pactbound Initiate|Pactbound Initiate]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/language/Erutaki|Erutaki]] or [[DATABASE/language/Jotun|Giant]] language, must have earned the trust of a saumen kar who initiates you into the archetype; trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]]

---
You befriended one of the last saumen kar and were infused with a fraction of their power, granting you the potential to become a guardian of their ancient pact. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level. You can [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] and [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]] while it's snowing even lightly, even if it wouldn't be thick enough to normally grant [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealment]]. Finally, all saumen kar can sense the mark of their pact upon you, and their attitude toward you is typically one step better than it would be otherwise ([[DATABASE/condition/Hostile|hostile]] to [[DATABASE/condition/Unfriendly|unfriendly]], unfriendly to [[DATABASE/condition/Indifferent|indifferent]], etc.) Most saumen kar are unfriendly to outsiders; this would make them indifferent to you.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the pactbound initiate archetype.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Dedication:**

You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
