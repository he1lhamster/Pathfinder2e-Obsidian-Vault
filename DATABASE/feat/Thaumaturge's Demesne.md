You have claimed an area or location as your demesne, granting you the ability to ward and protect it. When you select this feat, choose a demesne, an area of no more than 2,000 square feet. You must legitimately own the area or, if its a public area, you must lay claim to the area without anyone contesting it.
 Once you've chosen your demesne, it's automatically protected by an arcane [[Private Sanctum]] spell with an unlimited duration, heightened to half your level rounded up and using your thaumaturge class DC in place of a spell DC, if necessary. Additionally, the demesne is attended by three unseen custodians, as a successful [[Unseen Custodians]] ritual, and one object in the area gains an elemental sentinel, as a successful [[Elemental Sentinel]] ritual.
