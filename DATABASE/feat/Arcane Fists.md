Your physical training encompasses unarmed combat forms. The damage die for your [[DATABASE/weapon/Fist|fist]] changes to 1d6 instead of 1d4. You don't take the normal –2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks. Your unarmed attacks gain the arcane trait, making them magical. At 5th level, you also gain the critical specialization effects of unarmed attacks in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] group and weapons in the brawling group.
