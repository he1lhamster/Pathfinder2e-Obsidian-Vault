You are adept at disguising coded messages as folksy idioms. Using slang, jokes, halfling loanwords, and the like, you convey a simple message consisting of three basic words (such as “Danger assassin flee” or “Meet me moonrise”). Your intended listener can attempt a Perception check to discern the message (DC 20 if an ally, DC 15 if a halfling ally, DC 10 if a halfling ally with Folksy Patter). Eavesdroppers can also attempt a Perception check against your [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] DC to discern your meaning. Any bonuses or penalties to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] apply.
