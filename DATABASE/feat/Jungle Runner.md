You run through the jungle as easily as you would through an open field. You ignore difficult terrain from underbrush within forests and jungles. You can always use the [[DATABASE/action/Take Cover|Take Cover]] action when you're within forest or jungle terrain to gain cover, even if you aren't adjacent to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind.

## Traits
