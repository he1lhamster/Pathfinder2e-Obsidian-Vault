**Trigger** You would take acid, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.

---
You absorb energy and hold it in your kinetic gate. You gain resistance equal to your level to the triggering damage—choose one eligible type of resistance. If this reaction prevents any damage, you gain a status bonus equal to half your level to the damage roll of the next metal impulse you use before the end of your next turn.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Metal:**

Effects with the metal trait conjure or manipulate metal. Those that manipulate metal have no effect in an area without metal. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of metal or have a connection to magical metal.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
