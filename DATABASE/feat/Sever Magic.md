## Traits

**Abjuration:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the abjuration school of magic, typically involving protection or wards.

**Arcane:**

This magic comes from the arcane tradition, which is built on logic and rationality. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Esoterica:**

The esoterica trait is present in many thaumaturge feats and class features that incorporate the various talismans, supernatural trinkets, and other objects you carry with you. Abilities that have the esoterica trait require you to be in possession of your esoterica to use them. Normally, you're assumed to always have your esoterica with you, but in some rare circumstances, you might either not have them on hand or have your gear stripped from you.
