You draw the life force out of your enemies to heal your own wounds. When you cast a [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] spell and damage at least one living creature, you regain Hit Points equal to the spell level of your _harm_ spell. If you aren’t a living creature, you gain no benefit from this feat.

## Traits

**Healing:**

A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.
