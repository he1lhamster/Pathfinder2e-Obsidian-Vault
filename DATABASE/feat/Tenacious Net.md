Escaping your nets is no simple task. The [[Athletics]] DC to [[Force Open]] or [[Escape]] your nets increases from 16 to 18. After a creature you grabbed with a net Escapes or Forces Open the net, stray strands of the net cling to the creature, causing them to remain [[Flat-Footed]] until the beginning of their next turn.
