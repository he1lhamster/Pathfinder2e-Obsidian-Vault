**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes
**Trigger** An enemy's Strike against you is a critical hit.

---
You collapse into a pile of bones, mitigating the worst of the damage you would have taken, and the triggering attack deals only the amount it would deal on a hit (typically full damage instead of double damage). Any other effects caused by a critical hit still occur. While collapsed, you're [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] and can't act except to Stand, which re-forms you into a skeleton in a standing position.

## Traits
