---
You've learned how to synchronize traditional martial arts and guns. You gain the Bullet Dancer Stance action. Whenever your proficiency in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you gain that new proficiency with bayonets, reinforced stocks, simple firearms and unarmed attacks.
 **Bullet Dancer Stance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (stance) **Requirements** You're unarmored and wielding a simple [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Firearm|firearm]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Bayonet|bayonet]], or [[DATABASE/weapon/Reinforced Stock|reinforced stock]]; **Effect** You enter a specialized stance for a unique martial art centered around the use of simple firearms. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are those using bayonets, reinforced stocks, and simple firearms. You can use [[DATABASE/action/Flurry of Blows|Flurry of Blows]] with these weapons. You can use your other monk feats or [[DATABASE/class_/Monk|monk abilities]] that normally require unarmed attacks with bayonets and reinforced stocks, so long as the feat or ability doesn't require a single, specific Strike. You can also use them with simple firearms when attacking within half the first range increment.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the bullet dancer dedication archetype.
