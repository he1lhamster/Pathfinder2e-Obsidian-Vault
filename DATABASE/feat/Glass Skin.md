**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 180. The Smoking Gun|Pathfinder #180: The Smoking Gun]]

Even if vitrumancy is a mystery to you, your blood and flesh know the secrets of the art of arcane glass. Patches of your skin to flicker into glass without warning. By focusing the effect, you can concentrate the glass into a powerful protective layer of magical obsidian. Once per day, you can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Stoneskin|stoneskin]] on yourself as an innate primal spell, though the spell covers you in a layer of glass instead of stone. During this innate stoneskin, you gain the Shatter Glass reaction. At 18th level, the stoneskin is heightened to 6th level instead of 4th.
**Shatter Glass** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** An adjacent creature Strikes you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack and deals damage; **Requirements** Your innate _stoneskin_ from Glass Skin is active; **Effect** You shatter some of the glass on your skin to damage your attacker. The attacker takes 3d10 damage and the duration of the _stoneskin_ decreases by 1 minute. At 14th level, the damage increases to 4d10, and at 18th level, the damage increases to 5d10.

## Traits

**Abjuration:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the abjuration school of magic, typically involving protection or wards.

**Aftermath:**

This trait describes feats that represent special abilities gained after exposure to the weird and deadly.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
