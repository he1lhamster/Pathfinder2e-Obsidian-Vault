You attained the cultural training of a ba-sadhak, a seeker of treasures and rare delights. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You're also trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Vanara Lore]] skill.
