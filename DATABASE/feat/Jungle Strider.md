You are adept at dodging roots, foliage, and other jungle obstacles. You ignore difficult terrain in forests and jungles. In addition, when you use the [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] skill to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of plant material, you aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], and when you roll a success at one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.
