<span class="item-trait">Automaton</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/heritage/Warrior Automaton|Warrior Automaton]]
**Requirements** You have a creature [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]].

---
You channel magical power from your core into your arm, empowering your attack as you attempt to slam your foe into the ground. Attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the foe's Fortitude DC. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to your check if the target is one size larger than you and a –4 circumstance penalty if it's larger than that. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size smaller than you and a +4 circumstance bonus if it's smaller than that.
**Critical Success** You slam the foe down and the magical energy overwhelms it. The creature is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]], becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round, and takes damage equal to 2d6 plus your Strength modifier. The foe is no longer grabbed or restrained by you.
**Success** You slam the foe down. The creature is knocked prone and takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The foe is no longer grabbed or restrained by you.
**Failure** You are unable to slam the creature, but your hold on the creature remains.
**Critical Failure** The creature breaks free and is no longer grabbed or restrained by you.
**Enhancement** Your arms better channel your core's power. You no longer take penalties for attempting to slam larger foes. Your foe takes damage equal to 2d6 plus your Strength modifier on a success (or double that on a critical success).
