You wear skulls to demoralize foes. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] and gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Intimidating Glare|Intimidating Glare]] skill feat. If you're already trained in Intimidation, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. If you pay 50 gp for a splendid skull mask, the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to Intimidation; its usage is worn (mask).
