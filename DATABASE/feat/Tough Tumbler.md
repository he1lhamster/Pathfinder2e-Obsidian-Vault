You’ve taken your share of licks while scurrying around the battlefield and know how to defend yourself against opportunistic attackers. Your movement ends only when you critically fail an [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Tumble Through]] an enemy’s space (or when you don’t have enough Speed to move all the way through its space). You still trigger reactions on a failure to Tumble Through, but you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks that you trigger in this way.
