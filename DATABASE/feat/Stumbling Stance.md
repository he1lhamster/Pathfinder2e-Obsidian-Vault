---
You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriated—bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements. While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Feint|Feint]]. The only Strikes you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. If an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance, it becomes flat-footed against the next stumbling swing Strike you make against it before the end of your next turn.

## Traits

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
