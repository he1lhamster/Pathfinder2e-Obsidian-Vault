# Just One More Thing <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Fortune</span><span class="item-trait">Investigator</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Requirements** Your most recent action was to [[Feint]], [[Request]], or [[Demoralize]], and you failed but didn't critically fail.

---
After your attempt to influence someone goes poorly, you add another bit of information or ask a pointed question, possibly salvaging your previous attempt. Reroll the failed check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check is the subject of a lead you're pursuing, double your bonus from [[Pursue a Lead]] on the rerolled check. That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.
 You can also use this action if you failed, but didn't critically fail, at a check to [[Lie]], [[Gather Information]], [[Make an Impression]], or [[Coerce]]. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.

## Traits

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
