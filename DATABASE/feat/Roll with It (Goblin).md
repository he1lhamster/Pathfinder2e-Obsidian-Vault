**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/heritage/Unbreakable Goblin|Unbreakable Goblin]]; [[DATABASE/feat/Bouncy Goblin|Bouncy Goblin]]
**Trigger** A foe hits you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.

---
When you take a big hit, your foe bounces you around like a rubber ball, but you escape the worst of the blow. Your foe can move you any distance of its choice up to 30 feet in a direction of its choice (this is not forced movement, and it triggers reactions as normal). You fall prone and are stunned 1. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. On a success, you take minimum damage from the attack, and on a critical success, if the attack was a critical hit, you don’t take double damage from the critical hit.
