You have just the thing for the situation. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Prescient Planner|Prescient Planner]] and [[DATABASE/feat/Prescient Consumable|Prescient Consumable]] feats. When using Prescient Planner, you can pull out the item as a 2-action activity to remove your [[DATABASE/equipment/Backpack|backpack]] (or a similar container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute.
