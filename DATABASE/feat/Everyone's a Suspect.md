You are so suspicious of everyone you meet that you keep mental notes on how to defeat them all—even your own allies. After interacting with a creature for at least 1 minute, you automatically [[DATABASE/action/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]] with that creature as the subject. You can have any number of such leads at any given time, and when you Pursue a Lead again, you don't give up any of these automatic subjects.
