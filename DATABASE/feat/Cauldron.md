You can use the [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]] activity to create oils and potions. You immediately gain the formulas for four common 1st-level oils or potions. At 4th level and every 2 levels beyond that, you gain the formula for a common oil or potion of that level or lower (a 4th-level potion if you're 4th level, a 6th-level potion if you're 6th level, and so on). If you have a familiar, you can have your familiar learn these formulas rather than storing them in a formula book. Your familiar can learn new formulas in the same way it learns new spells, and these formulas are transferred from a slain familiar to a new familiar in the same way spells are.
 You can brew a great deal of magic within your cauldron. When you Craft a batch of oils or potions, you can make up to six in a batch instead of the usual four per batch.
