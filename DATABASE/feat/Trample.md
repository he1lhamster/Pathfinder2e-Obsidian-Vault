Your eidolon Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of creatures at least one size smaller, Trampling each creature whose space it enters. It can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single Trample. It deals bludgeoning damage equal to the damage of its secondary attack against these creatures, which can attempt a basic Reflex save against your spell DC.

## Traits

**Eidolon:**

A creature with this trait is a [[DATABASE/class_/Summoner|summoner's]] eidolon. An action or spell with this trait can be performed by an eidolon only. An item with this trait can be used or worn by an eidolon only, and an eidolon can't use items that don't have this trait. (An eidolon can have up to two items invested.)

**Evolution:**

Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.
