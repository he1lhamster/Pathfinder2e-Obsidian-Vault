You were created from magic involving mirrors and still retain some ability to seek refuge in reflected illusions. You gain the Mirror's Trickery reaction. 
**Mirror's Trickery** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (concentrate, illusion, occult, visual) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You would be hit by a Strike; **Effect** You create an illusory duplicate at the last instant and attempt to trick your foe into striking it instead of you. The attacker attempts a DC 11 flat check; on a failure, the attack hits the duplicate, changing the result from a critical success to a success or a success to a failure.
