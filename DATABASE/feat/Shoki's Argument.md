You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]]. If you were already trained in Diplomacy (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can also cast [[DATABASE/spell/Disrupt Undead|disrupt undead]] as a divine innate cantrip at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
