You feel a connection to [[Shoki]], the rambling collectors of wayward souls, and might have found old texts written by one. You are trained in [[Diplomacy]]. If you were already trained in Diplomacy (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can also cast [[Disrupt Undead]] as a divine innate cantrip at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
