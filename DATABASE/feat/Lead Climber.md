**Prerequisites** expert in [[Athletics]]

---
When climbing, you can prepare routes for others to follow, and you can pull your allies up to avoid disaster. When your allies attempt to [[Climb]] a route you set using the [[Follow the Expert]] exploration activity, if any of them critically fail their checks to Climb, you can attempt an [[Athletics]] check against the same DC. If you succeed, your ally fails instead of critically failing. If you also critically fail, you both experience the consequences of the critical failure.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
