You and your eidolon move together. You each use a single action to Stride. Either of you that has the corresponding movement type can [[DATABASE/action/Burrow|Burrow]], [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]], or [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]] instead.

## Traits

**Tandem:**

Actions with this trait involve you and your eidolon acting in concert. You can't use a tandem action if either you or your eidolon can't act, if you haven't [[DATABASE/action/Manifest Eidolon|Manifested your Eidolon]], or if you've Manifested your Eidolon in a way where it isn't a separate entity (such as with the [[DATABASE/feat/Meld into Eidolon|Meld into Eidolon]] feat). Tandem actions often let both you and your eidolon take separate actions, but these must be actions taken separately by you and your eidolon; you can't use a tandem action to take another tandem action.
