---
You were formed from a [[DATABASE/ritual/Clone|clone]] ritual or alchemical experiment. Created as a vessel for another creature, you can suppress your sentience momentarily, making your mind harder to alter. You gain the Empty Vessel reaction.
 **Empty Vessel** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You would take mental damage or be affected by a mental effect; **Effect** You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Will saves and resistance to mental damage equal to your level against the triggering effect. This applies only to the initial effect, not successive saves, [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent mental damage]], or other repeated effects.

## Traits

**Lineage:**

A feat with this trait indicates a character's descendance from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat. You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of these feats.

**Reflection:**

A creature with this trait has the [[DATABASE/ancestry/Reflection|reflection]] versatile heritage. Reflections are beings who are copies of living people, whether through cloning, planar duplication, or another mechanism. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by reflections.
