You rearrange your bones into a bestial shape. Once per day, you can cast [[Animal Form]] as a divine innate spell. When you cast it, you choose the spell's level: 3rd, 4th, or 5th. Your battle form looks like a skeletal version of the animal. In this form, you retain the benefits of any skeleton feats that do not require the use of hands or the ability to communicate.
