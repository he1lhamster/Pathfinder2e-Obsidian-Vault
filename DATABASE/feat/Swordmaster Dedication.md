Your Swords training taught you to never lose hold of your weapon. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when foes attempt to [[Disarm]] you. If you have the [[Deft Cooperation]] feat and critically succeed on a check to [[Aid]] an ally’s attack roll or skill check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus from Deft Cooperation (instead of a +1 bonus) the first time you attempt an attack roll or attempt a skill check where the bonus would apply.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Swordmaster archetype.
