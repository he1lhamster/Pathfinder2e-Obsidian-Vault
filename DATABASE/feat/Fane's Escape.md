A good getaway requires a good distraction. You Interact to draw a deck of cards and flip it in a fluttering explosion, causing you to become briefly [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to all other creatures using vision as their precise sense, and then you [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]]. You have enough cover to Sneak until the end of your turn. This leaves all of the cards from the deck scattered about the room; collecting them into a deck again takes several minutes.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

### Perilous Larceny

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/PFS Guide|PFS Guide]]
Pirate captain Stella Fane (CN female human privateer; _Lost Omens Character Guide_ 119) joined the Pathfinder Society as a venture-captain as part of a deal to help the Society make it through the heavily armed naval blockades of Port Peril's Free Captains. Cunning and competitive, Stella's greatest weakness as a leader of the Society is her uncompromising hatred of the Chelaxian government. Those who can avoid ending up sunk or executed by Chelaxian naval commanders while assisting Stella may leave with a few more tricks than they had before seeing the skilled pirate in action. Fane's Fourberie and Stella's Stab and Snag, below, are class feats that rogues or swashbucklers can select. When you select either feat, it loses the trait from the other class.
