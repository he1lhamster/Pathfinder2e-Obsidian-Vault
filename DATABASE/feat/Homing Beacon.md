As your spell strikes a target, you plant a beacon in the target's mind that announces its presence to those nearby. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The amped cantrip must be one that has one or more targets and must either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw.

---
**Amp** Choose one creature hit by the spell (if the spell has a spell attack roll) or that fails its save against the spell (if the spell requires a save). A psychic beacon emits from the creature's location, making it easier to notice the creature as the mind and attention of onlookers is subtly drawn to it. For 1 minute, if the target would be [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], it's instead merely [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and if it would be concealed, it's no longer concealed.

## Traits

**Amp:**

An amp is a special thoughtform that modifies the properties of your psi cantrips. Psi cantrips each have their own amp, and feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps.
