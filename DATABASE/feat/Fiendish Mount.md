Your steed ally manifests a suite of powerful and sinister gifts granted to it by your deity. It gains darkvision, its maximum Hit Points increase by 40, and it gains weakness 10 to good damage.
 Additionally, it grows wings appropriate for a servitor of your deity (such as bat wings for a devil), granting it a fly Speed equal to its Speed. It gains the fiend trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor it has become (such as daemon, demon, or devil).

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
