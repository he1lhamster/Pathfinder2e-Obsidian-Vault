**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Mauler|Mauler]]*
* This archetype offers Unbalancing Sweep at a different level than displayed here.

---
You make a great sweep about yourself, knocking creatures off their feet and away from you. Choose up to three adjacent foes and choose whether to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] all three of them. Whichever of the two options you choose, roll a separate [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against each foe, performing the same action against each foe. Each attempt counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all the attempts.

## Archetype Use

This feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.

## Traits

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Open:**

These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an open only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.
