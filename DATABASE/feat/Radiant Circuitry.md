Your biological circuitry emits light like a torch, casting bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet). The light shuts off when you take this action again or are knocked [[Unconscious]].

## Traits

**Android:**

A synthetic humanoid ancestry created by artificial means. Most common in Numeria.

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Light:**

Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.
