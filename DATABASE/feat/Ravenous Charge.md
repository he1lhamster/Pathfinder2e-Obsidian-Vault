Hungry for the flesh of the living, you hurl yourself into the fray, teeth gnashing. You Stride. If you end your movement within melee reach of a living creature, you can make an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] that creature. If you succeed, you then make a jaws Strike against that creature.
