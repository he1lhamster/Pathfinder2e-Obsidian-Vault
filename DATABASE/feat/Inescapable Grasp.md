---
Your grasp has a supernatural quality to it, preventing your foes from easily escaping—with or without magical assistance. If a creature you have grabbed attempts to use a teleportation spell or effect, it must succeed at a DC 15 flat check or the spell fails. If a creature you have grabbed attempts to [[Escape]] while under the effect of [[Freedom of Movement]], it must succeed at a DC 15 flat check or be forced to roll the Escape attempt normally, rather than automatically succeeding.
