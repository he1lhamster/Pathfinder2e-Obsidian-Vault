The venom you produce is exceptionally potent and difficult to overcome. Your vishkanyan venom gains the virulent trait, requiring two consecutive saves to reduce the venom's stage by 1. A critical success reduces your venom's stage by only 1 instead of by 2.

## Traits

These faintly ophidian humanoids have venomous blood and saliva.
