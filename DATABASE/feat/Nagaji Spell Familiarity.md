Either through study, exposure, or familial devotion, you have the magic of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Naga|nagas]] bubbling in your blood. During your daily preparations, choose [[DATABASE/spell/Daze|daze]], [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]], or [[DATABASE/spell/Mage Hand|mage hand]]. Until your next daily preparations, you can cast the chosen spell as an occult innate cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
