From your collection of religious trinkets, you pull out opposing divine objects—such as the religious symbols of two deities that are hated enemies—and combine them in a display that causes discordant clashes of divine energy that are especially distracting to the faithful. Roll your choice of a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check against the Will DC of a creature you can see within 60 feet, with the following results. If the creature is particularly devoted to a deity, such as a [[DATABASE/class_/Cleric|cleric]], celestial, monitor, fiend, or other creature with divine spells, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your skill check. The GM might determine that a creature that despises all deities, such as an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Alghollthu|alghollthu]], is unaffected.
**Critical Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to your attacks until the end of your next turn.
**Success** The creature is flat-footed against your attacks until the end of your current turn.

## Traits

**Divine:**

This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Enchantment:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the enchantment school of magic, typically involving mind control, emotion alteration, and other mental effects.

**Esoterica:**

The esoterica trait is present in many thaumaturge feats and class features that incorporate the various talismans, supernatural trinkets, and other objects you carry with you. Abilities that have the esoterica trait require you to be in possession of your esoterica to use them. Normally, you're assumed to always have your esoterica with you, but in some rare circumstances, you might either not have them on hand or have your gear stripped from you.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.
