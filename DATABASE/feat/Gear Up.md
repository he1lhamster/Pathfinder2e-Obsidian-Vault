Whether it's wooden stakes, holy water, or more unusual tools, you always have just the right thing to handle an undead's unusual weaknesses and vulnerabilities. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Prescient Planner|Prescient Planner]] and [[DATABASE/feat/Prescient Consumable|Prescient Consumable]] feats. When using Prescient Planner specifically to pull out an item you need to deal with an undead's weakness or vulnerability, you can pull out the item as a 2-action activity to remove your backpack (or similar container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute. If you have the Hunter's Sanctum feat, you keep your sanctum well stocked with the basics and can spend 1 hour in your sanctum refreshing your supplies in order to meet the requirements for Prescient Planner, even if you haven't been able to purchase goods.
