The extent of the corruption within you does more than simply sap your foes' strength, it devastates their minds and reflexes. When you use [[DATABASE/feat/Cruelty|Cruelty]], choose whether you want to make the creature [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]] as normal, to make it [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] on a failed save (clumsy 2 on a critical failure), or to make it [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] on a failed save (stupefied 2 on a critical failure).

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
