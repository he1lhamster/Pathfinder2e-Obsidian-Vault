## Traits

**Elf:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the elf ancestry. Elves are mysterious people with rich traditions of magic and scholarship who typically have [[DATABASE/monsterability/Low-Light Vision|low-light vision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by elves. A weapon with this trait is created and used by elves.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
