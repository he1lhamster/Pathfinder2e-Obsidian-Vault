**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
**Access** Taldan nationality
**Trigger** You are affected by an emotion effect.

---
Taldan pride means you never show weakness. Roll a [[Deception]] check and compare the result to any observing creatures’ Perception DCs. On a success, that creature believes you were unaffected by the emotion effect. A creature tricked in this manner can’t benefit from the emotion effect and can’t use abilities that require you to be under this emotion effect; for example, if you successfully use this ability to trick a [[Will-o’-Wisp]] into believing you aren’t under a fear effect, it can’t use its Feed on Fear ability on you.
