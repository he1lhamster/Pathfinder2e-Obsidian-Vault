Pathfinders are trained to help each other be safe and successful, and you know how to jolt your allies back to their senses. Attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check on an adjacent ally who is [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]], [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]], [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] and choose one of those conditions. The DC is the DC for the effect that caused the condition.
**Critical Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 2. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.
**Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.
**Failure** The target is unaffected.
**Critical Failure** You increase the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, increase the duration by 1 round instead.
