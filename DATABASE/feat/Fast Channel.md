Divine power is always at your fingertips, swiftly responding to your call. When you cast [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] by spending 2 actions, you can get the effects of the 3-action version instead of the 2-action version.
 You can do this with _harm_ if you have harmful font or _heal_ if you have healing font (or both if you have Versatile Font).
