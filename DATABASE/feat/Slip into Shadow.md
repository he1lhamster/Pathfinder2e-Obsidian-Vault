**Prerequisites** ability to cast at least one spell with the darkness trait

---
Your shadow magic bleeds into the space around you. Whenever you cast a spell with the darkness trait, a lingering aura of shadows reduces bright light within a 5-foot emanation around you to dim light until the end of your turn. Like in natural dim light, you can use these shadows to [[Hide]], but the aura still makes your overall position obvious, so you can't become [[Undetected]] through the use of these shadows alone.

## Traits
