**Prerequisites** trained in [[Society]]

---
You are adept at quickly scanning loose papers and carefully discerning the contents of sealed letters without damaging the seal. You can attempt [[Society]] checks to [[Decipher Writing]] on a message that is only partially glimpsed, upside down or reversed from your perspective, or even sealed. However, on a critical failure, the recipient is made aware of your efforts (for instance, you damage the seal or disturb the papers in some way). When using this feat to decipher sealed letters, your attempt to Decipher Writing gains the manipulate trait. This feat doesn't prevent witnesses from noticing your efforts, particularly with sealed letters which you must manipulate directly in order to read; you might need to attempt [[Deception]] or [[Stealth]] checks to avoid being noticed.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
