The fey magic inside of you is a vital part of your body, and you can steal other sources of magic to replenish yours. You can draw power from your magical equipment to replenish your health. You drain one of your invested items, in the process regaining Hit Points equal to double the item's level.
 In addition, you can attempt a counteract check with a total bonus equal to 10 + the drained item's level against one effect that gave you the [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] condition. If you succeed, you reduce the chosen condition's value by 1.
 An item drained by this action becomes non-magical until the next time you make your daily preparations.
**Special** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|human]], goblin for [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblin]], etc.).

## Traits

**All Ancestries:**

A feat with this trait is available to all ancestries.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
