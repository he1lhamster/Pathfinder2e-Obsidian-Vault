You've made the Crimson Oath a part of yourself; you mumble it in your sleep and recite it under your breath as you march. You become an expert in divine spell attacks and spell DCs. If you have spent at least 2 Focus Points since the last time you [[Refocus]], you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.
