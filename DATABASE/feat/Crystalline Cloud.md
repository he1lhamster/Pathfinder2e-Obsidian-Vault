---
When you use Crystalline Dust, you can spend one additional action to disperse the motes as a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on you instead of as haze; the activity gains the concentrate trait. All creatures within the cloud become [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it.

## Traits

**Aphorite:**

A type of planar scion descended from a being from Axis, the Plane of Law.
