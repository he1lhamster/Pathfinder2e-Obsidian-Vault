Your body readily accepts and retains minor changes. When you drink one of your alchemical items that has the elixir and infused traits and a duration of 1 minute or more, you can make the elixir’s duration indefinite. You can do so only if the elixir’s level is half your level or lower. If you later consume a different elixir and make it indefinite, the effect of the previous indefinite elixir ends.
