Your lineage traces back to a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Daemon|daemon]], one of the manifestations of horrific forms of death that devour souls within their foul home of [[DATABASE/plane/Abaddon|Abaddon]]. As a result, you cling tenaciously to the last shreds of your own life force. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Diehard|Diehard]] feat.
