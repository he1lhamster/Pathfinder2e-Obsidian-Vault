The earth parts before you, letting you swim through it. You gain a burrow Speed equal to your land Speed and can immediately [[DATABASE/action/Burrow|Burrow]] once. You don't gain the ability to breathe while in the earth, so you must hold your breath. The impulse ends at the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. If you're inside the earth when the impulse ends, you immediately return to the surface directly above you, fall [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] when you reach the surface, and are [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] until the end of your next turn.

**Level (14th)** You can burrow through rock and similar dense earthen matter, leaving no tunnels or signs of your passing.

## Traits

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
