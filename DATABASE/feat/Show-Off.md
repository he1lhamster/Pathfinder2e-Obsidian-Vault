**Source** [[Firebrands]]
**Archetype** [[Acrobat]]
**Frequency** once per minute
**Prerequisites** [[Acrobat Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You succeed at an [[Acrobatics]] or [[Athletics]] check deemed suitably challenging and meaningful by the GM.

---
As is the tradition with many Firebrands, you call your shot and look to impress with an extra bit of panache or a greater stunt. Attempt the triggering check again, using the second result. On a success, you gain the normal results of the check, plus you feel invigorated by your stunt and gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level (double your level on a critical success). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute. Typically, a challenging task is one with at least a standard DC for your level, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action's success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
