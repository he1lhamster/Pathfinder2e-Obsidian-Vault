---
You are skilled at saying one thing while meaning something different. You disguise your true meaning behind other words and phrases, relying on subtle emphasis and shared experience to convey meaning that only your allies understand. Any allies who have traveled alongside you for at least 1 full week automatically discern your meaning. Other observers must succeed at a Perception check against your [[Deception]] DC to realize you are passing a secret message, and they must critically succeed to understand the message itself.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
