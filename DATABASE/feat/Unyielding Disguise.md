**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
**Prerequisites** ability to cast [[Humanoid Form]] or [[Illusory Disguise]]

---
When you cast _humanoid form_ or _illusory disguise_ to alter your appearance, the spell's duration is 2 hours. At the end of the duration, you can extend the spell's duration for another hour, but doing so is taxing, making you [[Drained]]. You can keep extending it in this way, increasing your drained condition by 1 each time, to a maximum duration of 6 hours.
