Your frigid gaze can turn a foe's blood to ice. The triggering creature must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. It then becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Failure** The triggering spell takes a –2 status penalty to its spell attack rolls and DCs.
**Critical Failure** The triggering spell is disrupted.
