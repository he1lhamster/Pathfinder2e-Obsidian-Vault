You can transform into a specific, curious-looking human form. This human form is the same age and body type as your tengu form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as height, though your nose remains as long as your beak and your complexion has red undertones, no matter the skin color of your human form. Using Long-Nosed Form counts as creating a disguise for the [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]]. Due to your imperfect transformation, your transformation doesn't automatically defeat Perception DCs to determine whether you are human, though you may be able to explain away or hide your tengu traits. You lose your beak unarmed Strike in your human form, as well as any other unarmed Strikes you gained from a tengu heritage or ancestry feat. You can remain in your human form indefinitely, and you can shift back to your tengu form by using this action again.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Polymorph:**

These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can't be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.
 If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Tengu:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the tengu ancestry. Tengus are humanoids who resemble birds. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tengus. An item with this trait is created and used by tengus.

**Transmutation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.
