**Trigger** You fail or critically fail an attack roll or Will save.

---
You burn out all of your rage to ensure that your attack lands and your mind remains free. Reroll the triggering attack roll or Will save with a +2 circumstance bonus, use the better result, and resolve the effect. You then immediately stop raging.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
