You can open your mouth to an immense size and spew forth an impossibly large field of tentacles. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Black Tentacles|black tentacles]] once per day as an innate occult spell, though when you do so, you spew them from your mouth out to the appropriate range, where they take root and begin [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grappling]] creatures as usual. The tentacles recognize you as a part of them and don't attempt to Grapple you, even if you are in the area.
