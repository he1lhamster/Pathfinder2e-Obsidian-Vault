You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Azarketi Lore]].
