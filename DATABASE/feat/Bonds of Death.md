You sway with the motions of your spells that animate the dead, channeling your power to sustain two at the same time. You Sustain your previous casting of _animate dead_, binding the necromantic energy of the two spells together with metaphysical twine. On subsequent rounds, you can Sustain both _animate dead_ spells with a single action to Sustain the Spell. This benefit lasts until either of the spells ends.
