You tell a quick story or begin telling a longer tale. This is most useful when you want to prove your scholarly credibility or impress someone quickly. Roll a check with a skill that can be used to [[Recall Knowledge]] in which you have expert proficiency, using the result entry for the [[Perform]] action. Like Performing, Storytelling rarely has an effect on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy checks against the observers—or even change their attitudes—if the GM sees fit. This action is not a Performance and cannot be used in place of anything that requires you to Perform.
