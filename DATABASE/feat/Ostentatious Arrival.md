If the next action you take is to [[DATABASE/action/Manifest Eidolon|Manifest your Eidolon]] as a three-action activity, or to Cast a three-action summoning Spell, the creature appears in an explosion. All creatures in a 10-foot emanation around the creature you summoned or manifested take 1d4 fire damage per spell level for a summoning spell, or 1d4 damage per 2 levels for Manifesting your Eidolon. If the creature you summoned or manifested has the acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, or water trait, the damage is that type instead (or cold damage for the water trait). If the creature has more than one of these traits, you choose which damage type to deal.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
