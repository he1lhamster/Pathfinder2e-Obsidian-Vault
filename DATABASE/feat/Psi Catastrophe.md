You stop holding your power back, unleashing it all in a catastrophic blast. All creatures in a 20-foot emanation take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per level with a basic Reflex save. Your psyche subsides as your power is expended.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Evocation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.

**Mindshift:**

An action with this trait can always be altered to use the raw power of your mind. When you take this action, you can choose to replace any damage it deals with mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Psyche:**

Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.
