Your understanding of life expands, allowing you to mimic a wider range of creatures. Add the forms in [[DATABASE/spell/Insect Form|insect form]] to your [[DATABASE/spell/Wild Shape|wild shape]] list. Whenever you use _wild shape_ to polymorph into the non-flying insect form listed in [[DATABASE/spell/Pest Form|pest form]], the duration is 24 hours instead of 10 minutes.
