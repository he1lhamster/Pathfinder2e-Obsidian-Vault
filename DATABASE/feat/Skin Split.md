You claw open the top layer of your scales and peel off the premature shed in order to remove harmful substances from your skin. You immediately end all [[Persistent Damage]] from effects that coat your skin (such as fire and most persistent acid damage). If you're suffering from an effect other than persistent damage that depends on continuous contact with your skin, and if that effect allows a saving throw, immediately attempt a new saving throw against that effect.

## Traits

Nagaji are brawny humanoids with scaled skin and serpentine heads, many of whom serve or respect nagas.
