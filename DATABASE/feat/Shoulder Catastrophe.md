<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Swordmaster]]
**Prerequisites** [[Swordmaster Dedication]]
**Trigger** An enemy critically succeeds at a Strike against an adjacent ally.

---
You’ve trained to protect your allies by diverting the worst attacks to yourself. The enemy doesn’t double the damage from the triggering Strike but instead applies the normal damage to both you and your ally. Both of you take any effects that would happen on a hit that dealt damage, such as poison, but neither of you are subject to any effects that would happen only on a critical success.
