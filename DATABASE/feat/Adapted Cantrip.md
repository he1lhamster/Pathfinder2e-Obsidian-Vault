# Adapted Cantrip <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Human</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Prerequisites** spellcasting class feature

---
Through study of multiple magical traditions, you've altered a spell to suit your spellcasting style. Choose one cantrip from a magical tradition other than your own. If you have a spell repertoire or a spellbook, replace one of the cantrips you know or have in your spellbook with the chosen spell. If you prepare spells without a spellbook (if you're a [[DATABASE/class_/Cleric|cleric]] or [[DATABASE/class_/Druid|druid]], for example), one of your cantrips must always be the chosen spell, and you prepare the rest normally. You can cast this cantrip as a spell of your class's tradition.
 If you swap or retrain this cantrip later, you can choose its replacement from the same alternate tradition or a different one.
