A magnetic field surrounds you. Choose a polarity when you take this action. You can switch the polarity as a free action at the start of each of your turns while you remain in this stance.
 **Attract** A creature that is wearing metal armor, has the metal trait, or is made of metal treats squares in your kinetic aura as difficult terrain when moving away from you. You pull unattended metal objects of light Bulk or less in your kinetic aura to you. They gather in your space and move with you.
 **Repel** A creature that is wearing metal armor, has the metal trait, or is made of metal treats squares in your kinetic aura as difficult terrain when moving closer to you. You push unattended metal objects of light Bulk or less in your kinetic aura away. They stop moving once they're outside your aura.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Metal:**

Effects with the metal trait conjure or manipulate metal. Those that manipulate metal have no effect in an area without metal. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of metal or have a connection to magical metal.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
