You transcend the limitations of form. While under the effects of [[Wild Shape]], you can change into any other form on your _wild shape_ list; if the durations of the forms would vary, use the shorter of the two durations.
 Once per day, you can transform into a kaiju, with the effects of [[Nature Incarnate]]; if you have [[Plant Shape]], you can instead transform into a green man.
