You've devoted extra time in the lab to improve your knowledge of alchemy. You learn the formulas for two alchemical items each time you level up instead of one; these must still be elixirs or tools. The number of versatile vials you can create each day increases by 1 if you're an expert in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]], 2 if you're a master, or 3 if you're legendary.
