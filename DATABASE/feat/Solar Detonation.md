Blinding flames explode in a swirling sphere! The detonation fills a 20-foot burst within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area takes 6d6 fire damage, plus 2d6 vitality damage if it has void healing, and can become [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] depending on the result of its Reflex save. The light from Solar Detonation is sunlight for creatures with a particular vulnerability to sunlight. Each creature that attempts a save becomes temporarily immune to being dazzled or blinded by Solar Detonation for 10 minutes, but not the impulse's other effects.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage and is dazzled until the start of your next turn.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is blinded for 1 minute.

**Level (+2)** Increase the fire damage by 1d6 and the vitality damage by 1d6.

## Traits

**Fire:**

Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Incapacitation:**

An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Vitality:**

Effects with this trait heal living creatures with energy from the Forge of Creation, deal vitality energy damage to undead, or manipulate vitality energy.
