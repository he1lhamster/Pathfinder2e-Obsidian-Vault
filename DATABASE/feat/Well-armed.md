Your detachable limbs offer flexibility. You Interact to remove your arm and wield it in the other one, increasing your reach by 5 feet for any one-handed weapon held in that arm. If your next action is a Strike with that weapon, creatures that were outside your reach that you can now hit are [[Flat-Footed]] against your first attack. You don't have a free hand while holding the arm. You can Interact to reattach the arm while holding it.
