As a member of dragonkind, you project unflappable confidence (that collapses catastrophically against the deadliest foes). When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a failure against a fear effect, you get a critical failure instead. 
In addition, when you attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a foe of your level or lower, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check.
