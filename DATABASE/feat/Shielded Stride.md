# Shielded Stride <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Fighter</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Bastion]]*, [[Viking]]*
* This archetype offers Shielded Stride at a different level than displayed here.

---
When your shield is up, your enemies' blows can't touch you. When you have your shield raised, you can Stride to move half your Speed without triggering reactions that are triggered by your movement (such as [[Attack of Opportunity]]). You can use Shielded Stride while [[Fly]] or [[Swim]] instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.

## Archetype Use

This feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.
