Your devotion to discovering and hoarding abstruse truths borders on the fanatical, and you can bring this devotion to bear. You gain the cleric's [[DATABASE/feat/Domain Initiate|Domain Initiate]] feat but must select [[DATABASE/domain/Knowledge Domain|knowledge]], [[DATABASE/domain/Secrecy Domain|secrecy]], or [[DATABASE/domain/Truth Domain|truth]] as your domain. You cast that domain's domain spell as a focus spell of the same tradition as your cantrip from Eldritch Researcher Dedication, and you [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] by contemplating abstruse mysteries rather than praying to a god. When an ability would manifest a divine symbol—such as the [[DATABASE/spell/Word of Truth|word of truth]] focus spell—it instead manifests as a strange shape unique to you that seems to defy geometry.
**Special** You can take this feat up to three times, selecting a different domain each time.
