# Seeker of Truths <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 164. Hands of the Devil]]
**Archetype** [[Eldritch Researcher]]
**Prerequisites** [[Eldritch Researcher Dedication]]

---
Your devotion to discovering and hoarding abstruse truths borders on the fanatical, and you can bring this devotion to bear. You gain the cleric's [[Domain Initiate]] feat but must select [[Knowledge Domain]], [[Secrecy Domain]], or [[Truth Domain]] as your domain. You cast that domain's domain spell as a focus spell of the same tradition as your cantrip from Eldritch Researcher Dedication, and you [[Refocus]] by contemplating abstruse mysteries rather than praying to a god. When an ability would manifest a divine symbol—such as the [[Word of Truth]] focus spell—it instead manifests as a strange shape unique to you that seems to defy geometry.
**Special** You can take this feat up to three times, selecting a different domain each time.
