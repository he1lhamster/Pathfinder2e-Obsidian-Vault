Your leaders are skilled at working with one another. When a leader uses the [[Focused Attention]] kingdom activity to aid another leader's kingdom check, the circumstance bonus granted by a success is increased to +3.
 At 11th level, your leaders' collaborative style leads them to ever greater successes when they work together. When a leader uses the Focused Attention kingdom activity to aid another leader's check, treat a critical failure on the aided check as a failure. If your kingdom has at least the expert rank in the skill used in the aided check, treat a failure on the check as a success. (This does not allow you to ever improve a critical failure to a success.)

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
