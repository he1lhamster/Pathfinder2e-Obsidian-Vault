---
Every Firebrand can recognize the skill of others, but you've turned it into an art you can wield in combat. You compliment a foe's form or technique, and your unexpected praise distracts them from their surroundings. Attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check against that enemy's Will DC. Regardless of your result, they are temporarily immune to your Grudging Compliments for 10 minutes.
**Critical Success** The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] for 1 round.
**Success** The target becomes flat-footed against your attacks for 1 round.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Linguistic:**

An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
