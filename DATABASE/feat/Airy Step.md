You create a blanket of fog in a 5–foot burst centered on one corner of your space. All creatures within that area are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and all others are concealed to them. This concealment applies to the triggering effect, and the fog lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. After resolving the triggering effect, you Step.
