Your connection to the earth makes natural uneven surfaces less of a hindrance for you. You can ignore difficult terrain caused by rubble and uneven ground made of stone and earth. In addition, when you use the [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] skill to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone and earth, you aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], and when you roll a success at one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.

## Traits
