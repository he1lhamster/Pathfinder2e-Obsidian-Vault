Long ago, [[Qlippoth]] marked someone in your lineage, most likely through their ancient runestones that dot Golarion's surface. Yours is an old lineage, primordial and twisted, and you have a sense for similarly twisted things. You're trained in [[Occultism]]. If you're already trained in Occultism (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [[Oddity Identification]] skill feat.

## Traits

**Lineage:**

A feat with this trait indicates a character's descendance from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat. You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of these feats.

**Tiefling:**

A creature with this trait has the tiefling versatile heritage. Tieflings are [[Planar Scion]] descended from fiends. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tieflings.
