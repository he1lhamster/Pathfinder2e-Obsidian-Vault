You fill an area with your force of will, towering beyond where your true form should be. Increase your size to Large until the beginning of your next turn. Your equipment grows with you but returns to natural size if removed. You're [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]]. Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a +2 status bonus to melee damage. Towering Presence has no effect if you were already Large or larger.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Divine:**

This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Illusion:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the illusion school of magic, typically involving false sensory stimuli.

**Polymorph:**

These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can't be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.
 If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.

**Tiefling:**

A creature with this trait has the tiefling versatile heritage. Tieflings are [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Planar Scion|planar scions]] descended from fiends. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tieflings.

**Transmutation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.
