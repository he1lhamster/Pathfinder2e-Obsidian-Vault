**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Prerequisites** Economy 14

---
Your kingdom's economy can liquidate resources in an emergency when funding runs out. The first time during a Kingdom turn in which you are forced to spend RP as the result of a failed skill check or a dangerous event, and that expense reduces you to 0 RP, you may instead reduce your RP to 1 and treat the expense as if it were paid in full. At the start of your next Kingdom turn, roll 4 fewer Resource Dice than normal.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
