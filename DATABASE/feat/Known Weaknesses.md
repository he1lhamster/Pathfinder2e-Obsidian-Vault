Whenever you [[DATABASE/action/Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Stratagem]], you can also attempt a check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] as part of that action. If you critically succeed at the Recall Knowledge check, you notice a weakness and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll from Devise a Stratagem. If you immediately convey this information to your allies as part of the check, each ally gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their next attack roll against the subject, as long as their attack is made before the beginning of your next turn.
