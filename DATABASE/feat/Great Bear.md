When you transform, you can take on a bear's bulk and size. You can spend an additional action when using Ursine Avenger Form to gain the effects of a 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Enlarge|enlarge]] spell, which lasts for the spell's normal duration or until you leave your Ursine Avenger Form, whichever comes first.
