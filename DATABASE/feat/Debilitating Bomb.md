Your bombs impose additional effects on your enemies. You mix a substance into the bomb that causes one of the following: dazzled, deafened, flat-footed, or a –5-foot status penalty to Speeds. If the attack with that bomb hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer that effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for this saving throw (even if someone else throws the bomb).

## Traits

**Additive 2:**

Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the [[DATABASE/feat/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level.
