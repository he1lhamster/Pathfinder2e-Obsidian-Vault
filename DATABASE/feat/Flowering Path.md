Vitality and elemental wood flows out from your body and into the earth, infusing it with a stream of new life. When you walk, you leave blooming flowers and sprouting vines in your wake. For the next minute, each time you Step or Stride, you create difficult terrain in each square you leave during your movement.

## Traits

**Ardande:**

Ardandes are [[Planar Scion]] descended from [[Kizidhar]] and other beings of elemental wood.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
