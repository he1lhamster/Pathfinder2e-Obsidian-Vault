**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Marshal Dedication|Marshal Dedication]]
**Trigger** An ally succeeds at a ranged Strike against an opponent within your weapon's first range increment.
**Requirements** You have a ranged or thrown weapon in hand.

---
You capitalize on your ally's attack to create a coordinated barrage. Make a ranged Strike with a –2 penalty against the opponent targeted by the triggering attack. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike. If this Strike is successful, combine the damage from the attack with the damage from your ally's attack for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.
