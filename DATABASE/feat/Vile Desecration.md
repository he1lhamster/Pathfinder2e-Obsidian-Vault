You combine unholy might with negative energy to damage [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Angel|angels]], [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Archon|archons]], and other self-righteous denizens of the Outer Planes. When you cast a [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] spell, you can change the damage you deal to celestial creatures to evil damage instead of negative damage.
