Your faith and hope can’t be shaken, and you won’t flee when lives are at stake. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against fear effects and emotion effects that inflict despair. When you would gain the [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] condition, you can choose to stand your ground and be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned]] for the effect’s duration as well, preventing you from running and allowing you to re-enter the fight more quickly when the effect ends.
