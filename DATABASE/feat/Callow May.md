You are among the most common of changelings—those born to [[Green Hag]]—and a vibrant green eye signifies that parentage. Your mother's manipulative nature and versatile voice gives you an edge when deceiving others. You gain the [[Charming Liar]] skill feat. If you roll [[Deception]] for initiative, foes in that combat encounter that haven't acted yet are [[Flat-Footed]] against you.

## Traits

**Changeling:**

A creature with this trait has the changeling versatile heritage. Changelings are the children of [[Hag]] and members of other humanoid ancestries. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by changelings.

**Lineage:**

A feat with this trait indicates a character's descendance from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat. You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of these feats.
