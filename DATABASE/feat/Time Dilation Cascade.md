You borrow a bit of time from the future to act now. Make six Strikes. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally to these Strikes. If you successfully hit a creature with multiple Strikes, combine those Strikes' damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. On your next turn, you regain 1 action instead of 3. This is before any alteration in your actions due to the [[Quickened]], [[Slowed]], and [[Stunned]] conditions.

## Traits

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
