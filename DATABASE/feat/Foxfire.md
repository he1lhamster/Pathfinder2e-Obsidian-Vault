# Foxfire <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Kitsune</span>

A crack of your tail sparks wisps of blue energy. Choose either electricity or fire when you gain this feat. You gain a foxfire ranged unarmed attack with a maximum range of 20 feet. The attack deals 1d4 damage of the chosen type (no ability modifier is added to the damage roll). Your foxfire attack is in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Sling|sling]] weapon group and has the magical trait. Like other unarmed attacks, you can improve this attack with [[DATABASE/equipment/Handwraps of Mighty Blows|handwraps of mighty blows]].
**Special** If you are a [[DATABASE/heritage/Frozen Wind Kitsune|frozen wind kitsune]], your foxfire deals cold damage instead of electricity or fire.
