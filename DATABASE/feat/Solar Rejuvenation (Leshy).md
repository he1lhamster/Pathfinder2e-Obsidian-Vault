If you rest outdoors for 10 minutes during the day, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × half your level. You gain this benefit in addition to any healing from [[DATABASE/action/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]. Leshies whose plant nourishment does not rely on photosynthesis require a similarly suitable environment. For example, fungus leshies need dark, damp environments and a pile of decaying plant matter.

## Traits
