Ropes are your tool of choice, and you deploy them in versatile ways. When [[Climb]] a rope, you move 5 more feet on a success and 10 more feet on a critical success, to a maximum of your Speed. This additional movement stacks with the effects of [[Quick Climb]].
 In addition, you can use a rope to hamper your foes. When holding a rope, you can attempt an Athletics check to [[Disarm]], [[Grapple]], or [[Trip]] a creature up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. If you critically fail such a check while holding a rope, you can drop the rope to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
