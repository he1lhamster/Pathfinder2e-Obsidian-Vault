Choose a swashbuckler style. You gain the [[DATABASE/class_/Swashbuckler|panache]] class feature, and you can gain panache in all the ways a swashbuckler of your style can. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or the skill associated with your style. If you were already trained in both skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in swashbuckler class DC. You don't gain any other effects of your chosen style.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the swashbuckler archetype.
