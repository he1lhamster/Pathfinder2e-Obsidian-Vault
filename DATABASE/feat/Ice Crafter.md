The ancient ice-crafting techniques of the saumen kar awaken within you. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]], or become an expert if you were already trained. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Magical Crafting|Magical Crafting]] skill feat. You can craft permanent items out of ice instead of metal or wood; these items are a translucent crystal-blue in color, resemble icicles and glacier ice, and have the same statistics and properties as [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron|cold iron]], including the price and the ability to deal additional damage to certain kinds of creatures.
 Any creature who wields or wears a piece of ice-crafted equipment takes 1 cold damage each round from contact with the primal cold of the crafted ice.
