Your eidolon flies into a frenzy. It gains the benefits of [[DATABASE/spell/Boost Eidolon|boost eidolon]] and gains temporary HP equal to your level, but takes a –2 penalty to AC. It can't voluntarily end the frenzy or start another frenzy while in the frenzy. The frenzy lasts for 1 minute, after which your eidolon is [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute and can't start another frenzy for 1 minute.

## Traits

**Eidolon:**

A creature with this trait is a [[DATABASE/class_/Summoner|summoner's]] eidolon. An action or spell with this trait can be performed by an eidolon only. An item with this trait can be used or worn by an eidolon only, and an eidolon can't use items that don't have this trait. (An eidolon can have up to two items invested.)

**Evolution:**

Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.
