---
You wave your banner, inspiring allies to throw off the shackles of fear. Each ally presently benefiting from your Cavalier's Banner feat reduces their current [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] condition by 1 and can choose to immediately attempt a new saving throw against any one mental effect currently affecting them. Regardless of the result, any ally that attempts a save is temporarily immune to Wave the Flag for 10 minutes.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Emotion:**

This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

**Visual:**

A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.
