Your lineage descends from [[Devil]], the conniving schemers of [[Hell]] malevolent hierarchy. You're as skilled at noticing lies and twisted wordings as you are at constructing them. You are trained in [[Deception]] and [[Lore]]. If you were already trained in Deception (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [[Lie to Me]] skill feat.

A creature with this trait has the tiefling versatile heritage. Tieflings are [[Planar Scion]] descended from fiends. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tieflings.
