**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Highhelm|Highhelm]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]]
**Trigger** You are about to attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Coerce|Coerce]] a merchant or crafter.

---
You have an eye for detail and a mouth for pointing out flaws, which makes it all the easier to convince the merchants and crafters of King's Heart to help you. You quickly analyze the triggering creature's wares in hopes of finding something useful in your coercion and attempt a Crafting check.
**Critical Success** You have plenty to work with and can leave your target shocked with your analysis. If you a roll a success on your Intimidation check, you get a critical success instead. If you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
**Success** As critical success, but you only gain the benefits when rolling a success on your Intimidation check.
**Failure** You misjudge the wares, which makes you come across as unknowledgeable and less intimidating. You take a –1 circumstance penalty to your Intimidation check to Coerce.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty is –2.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
