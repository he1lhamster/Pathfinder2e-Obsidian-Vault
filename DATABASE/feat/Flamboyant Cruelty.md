You love to kick your enemies when they're down, and you look fabulous when you do. When you make a melee weapon Strike against a foe that has at least two of the following conditions, you gain a circumstance bonus to your damage roll equal to the number of these conditions the foe has. The qualifying conditions are [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy]], [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]], [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]], and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]]. If you hit such a foe, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks to [[DATABASE/action/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] and to perform your style's panache-granting actions until the end of your turn.

## Traits

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

Azaersi believes in rewarding loyalty and service, and she is always in search of reliable and trustworthy agents. Sensible officers, clever spies, and trade negotiators who show skill at dealing with non-hobgoblins are all likely to win General Azaersi's favor, and rewards that only she can offer.
