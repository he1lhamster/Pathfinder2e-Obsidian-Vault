Your tattoos are a work of eldritch genius, a masterpiece of art, magic, and skin. Choose a 3rd-level arcane spell from the same school as your Arcane Tattoos, either a common spell or another to which you have access, including a lower-level spell heightened to 3rd level if you wish. You can cast that spell once per day as an innate arcane spell.
