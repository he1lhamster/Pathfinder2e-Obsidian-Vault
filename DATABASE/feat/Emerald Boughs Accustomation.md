You are comfortable and socially capable in almost any cultural context. When you use the Society skill to [[DATABASE/action/Subsist|Subsist]], if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead; if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead; and if you roll a critical success, you can provide for another additional creature. Furthermore, when you attempt a Society check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about cultural practices and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
