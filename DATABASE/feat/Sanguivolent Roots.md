Blood-drinking vines grow from the ground in a 15-foot burst within 120 feet. Each living enemy in the area has its blood drained, taking 3d6 piercing damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC. Each time the vines drink blood, living creatures in the area who aren't your enemies regain HP equal to half the damage a single creature took; calculate this using the highest damage a single creature took. This is a healing vitality effect. Your enemies with [[Negative Healing]] in the area take vitality damage in the same amount as the healing. The vines last until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse. The first time you Sustain the impulse on subsequent turns, you can repeat the effect.

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Plant:**

Vegetable creatures have the plant trait. They are distinct from normal plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Wood:**

Effects with the wood trait conjure or manipulate wood. Those that manipulate wood have no effect in an area without wood. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of wood or have a connection to magical wood.
