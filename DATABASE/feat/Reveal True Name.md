---
You attempt to get a creature to do as you wish by threatening them with your knowledge of their true name. You must know and speak the creature's true name and say what you want the creature to do. Attempt an Intimidation check against the target's Will DC.
**Critical Success** The target does as you say out of a sense of self-preservation, and will not harm itself in any way. It becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Unfriendly|unfriendly]] (if it wasn't already unfriendly or hostile) but continues to comply for up to 1 day. The target is too scared of you to retaliate or flee, certain you would find them wherever they might go.
**Success** As critical success, but once the target becomes unfriendly, they avoid you and might act against you in an indirect manner, such as alerting your enemies to your location.
**Failure** The target refuses to comply and typically flees your presence to avoid your further use of their true name. If they were not already unfriendly or [[DATABASE/condition/Hostile|hostile]], they become unfriendly. They avoid you in the future and are likely to take indirect action against you.
**Critical Failure** The target refuses to comply and becomes hostile, if it wasn't already. If they perceive you as weak, they might attack you; otherwise, they likely flee to avoid your further use of their true name.

## Traits

**Auditory:**

Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deaf]] targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Emotion:**

This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**True Name:**

Certain spells, feats, and items have the true name trait. This trait means they require you to know a creature's true name to use them.
