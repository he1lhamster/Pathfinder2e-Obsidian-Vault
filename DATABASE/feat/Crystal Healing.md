You know how to stimulate a body's natural healing abilities through the application of resonant crystals. Doing so requires you to use at least two semiprecious stones with a total value of 5 gp or more in place of [[DATABASE/equipment/Healer's Tools|healer's tools]], which allows you to attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Treat Disease|Treat Disease]] or [[DATABASE/action/Treat Poison|Treat Poison]] using Occultism rather than [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]]. Examples and prices of semiprecious stones can be found under Gems.
 If you're an expert in Occultism and you use gems whose total value equals or exceeds 50 gp, you gain a +1 item bonus to your Occultism check. If you're a master and the gems' value equals or exceeds 700 gp, the item bonus increases to +2; if you're legendary in Occultism and the gems' value equals or exceeds 15,000 gp, the item bonus increases to +3.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Healing:**

A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
