Snares you create have complicated inner workings that are quite difficult to disable. Creatures attempting to [[Disable a Device]] your snares that use gears must succeed at an additional [[Thievery]] check in order to disable the snare. On a failed check, while the snare doesn't fully trigger, the grinding mechanisms deal bludgeoning damage to the creature equal to half your level. The snare still triggers on a critical failure, as normal.
