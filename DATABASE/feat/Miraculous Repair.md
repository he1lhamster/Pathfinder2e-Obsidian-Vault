---
Geniekin can't grant magical wishes, but some echo of power lingers within you. Faced with a mechanism that is damaged but not destroyed, you can wish it back into a functional state for a period of 10 minutes. The object must be mundane and no larger than 5 Bulk, such as a disabled locking mechanism in a door. For 10 minutes, the object functions as it should, ignoring any damage to its mechanism. This doesn't grant you any knowledge of what a device might do or how it ought to function. Once the 10 minutes are up, the object falls back into disrepair and is temporarily immune to Miraculous Repair for 1 day.
