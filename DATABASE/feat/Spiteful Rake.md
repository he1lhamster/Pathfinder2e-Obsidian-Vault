Your instincts sing of spite and malice, and you've learned a devastating trick: go for the eyes. You make a claw Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target is instead [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round and dazzled until restored to maximum hit points.
