---
Your nanites fly out of your body, swarming around you in a cloud. You become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] for a number of rounds equal to half your level. You can't use this concealment to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] or [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]], as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious. While Nanite Shroud is active, you can't use other abilities that require the use of your nanites.
