Your people used powerful magic to travel between distant worlds, and the remnants of that magic make such transportation easier for you. When you are the target of a teleportation spell that transports more than one person, it can affect an additional person beyond the normal limit, chosen by the caster. Additionally, when you're the target of a [[Teleport]] spell, you and the other targets arrive no farther than 1 mile off target, regardless of distance traveled.
