You can take the form of a plant creature. Add the forms listed in [[Plant Form]] to your [[Wild Shape]] list; if you don't have _wild shape_, you can instead cast _plant form_ once per day, heightened to the same level as your highest-level druid spell slot. Whenever you're polymorphed into another form using _wild shape_, you gain resistance 5 to poison.
