You smash a metal rod into your foe and call lightning to it. Attempt a 1-action melee [[DATABASE/action/Elemental Blast|Elemental Blast]] using the metal element. On a hit, the target is skewered with a metal rod, which gives it a –1 circumstance penalty to AC and saves against electricity; the penalty is –2 if the creature also has the metal trait, is made of metal, or is wearing metal armor. A hit creature immediately takes 1d12 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The creature can Interact to attempt a DC 10 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to pull the lightning rod free.

**Level (+6)** The electricity damage increases by 1d12.

## Traits

**Air:**

Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air with various degrees of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies.

**Composite:**

A composite impulse combines multiple elements. You can gain an impulse with the composite trait only if your kinetic elements include all the elements listed in the impulse's traits.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Metal:**

Effects with the metal trait conjure or manipulate metal. Those that manipulate metal have no effect in an area without metal. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of metal or have a connection to magical metal.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
