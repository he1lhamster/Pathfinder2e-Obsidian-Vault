---
Your rule brooks no dissent and stamps out traitors, making harsh examples of them. Once per Kingdom turn when you gain Unrest, you can attempt to crush the dissent by attempting a basic [[DATABASE/skill/Warfare|Warfare]] check. On a success, the Unrest increase is canceled, but on a critical failure, the Unrest increase is doubled. In addition, you gain a +1 status bonus to checks to resolve dangerous kingdom events that involve internal bickering, such as Feud.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
