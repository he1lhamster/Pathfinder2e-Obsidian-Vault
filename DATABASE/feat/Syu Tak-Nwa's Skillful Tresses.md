### Feats

**Source** [[Pathfinder 166. Despair on Danger Island]]
The player characters might learn some of these techniques from friends and rivals during their stay on Bonmu, allowing them to select the feats the next time they would gain a feat. Surviving combat against Syu Tak-nwa allows the characters to take the three witch feats, while defeating or impressing the Ahmoza twins allows them to take Entwined Energy Ki. Lighting the candles and praying in the temple of Irori's prayer room (area A8) gives them access to Wronged Monk's Wrath.
