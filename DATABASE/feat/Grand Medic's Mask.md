Your mask is infused with restorative magic associated with Ibex, the Flourishing Field, so it constantly repairs itself. You gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing 5]]. If you lose a limb or other body part, it regrows within 1 day. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to have the spell also give that creature temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's level until the start of your next turn.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

### Masks of the Magic Warriors

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 174. Shadows of the Ancients|Pathfinder #174: Shadows of the Ancients]]
In becoming Jatembe's new Magic Warriors, the heroes have unlocked secrets of magical potential that none have reached since the earliest Ten Magic Warriors walked the plazas of the Magaambya.
 On reaching 20th level, the heroes should have the option of taking one of these archetype feats, based on the type of animal they chose for their mask when they first created it in _Pathfinder Adventure Path #169: Kindled Magic_. These options are each themed to one of Jatembe's magic warriors, but if a hero's mask doesn't fit with a specific animal from this list or the player feels their animal embodies a different effect from the list, feel free to reflavor the feat names to fit the hero's spirit face. For instance, the Cunning Trickster mask could easily be a rodent or a fox, not just a spider.
