**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]

---
Your mind, like a [[Dark Naga]], foils attempts to read your thoughts. Any effect that specifically attempts to read your mind to glean information must succeed at a counteract check against the higher of your class DC or your spell DC to do so successfully; otherwise, it gains no information. The counteract level is equal to half your level rounded up.

## Traits

**Nagaji:**

Nagaji are brawny humanoids with scaled skin and serpentine heads, many of whom serve or respect nagas.
