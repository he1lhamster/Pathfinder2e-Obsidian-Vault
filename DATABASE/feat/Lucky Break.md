You catch yourself as you make a mistake. You can trigger Cat's Luck when you fail or critically fail on an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] skill check, in addition to its normal trigger. When you do, you reroll the triggering skill check and use the better result. This still counts against Cat's Luck's frequency, as normal.
