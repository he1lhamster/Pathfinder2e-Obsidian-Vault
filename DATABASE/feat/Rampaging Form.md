# Rampaging Form <span class="item-type">Feat 17</span>

<span class="item-trait">Kitsune</span>
**Source** [[Ancestry Guide]] 
**Prerequisites** [[Change Shape]] with a fox alternate form

---
Once per day, when you Change Shape into a fox, you can instead gain the effects of both the canine form of 5th-level [[Animal Form]] and 7th-level [[Fiery Body]] for 1 minute or until you shift back, whichever comes first. You can cast [[Produce Flame]] from the fiery body effect even though you're in a battle form.
**Special** If you are a [[Frozen Wind Kitsune]], your form is ice instead of fire. This changes the immunity and damage from the _fiery body_ effect to cold, changes the weakness to fire, and changes _produce flame_ to [[Ray of Frost]]

## Traits

**Kitsune:**

Shapeshifting humanoids whose true forms resemble foxes.
