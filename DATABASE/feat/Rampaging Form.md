# Rampaging Form <span class="item-type">Feat 17</span>

<span class="item-trait">Kitsune</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Ancestry Guide|Ancestry Guide]] 
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/action/Change Shape|Change Shape]] with a fox alternate form

---
Once per day, when you Change Shape into a fox, you can instead gain the effects of both the canine form of 5th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Animal Form|animal form]] and 7th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Fiery Body|fiery body]] for 1 minute or until you shift back, whichever comes first. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Produce Flame|produce flame]] from the fiery body effect even though you're in a battle form.
**Special** If you are a [[DATABASE/heritage/Frozen Wind Kitsune|frozen wind kitsune]], your form is ice instead of fire. This changes the immunity and damage from the _fiery body_ effect to cold, changes the weakness to fire, and changes _produce flame_ to [[DATABASE/spell/Ray of Frost|ray of frost]]
