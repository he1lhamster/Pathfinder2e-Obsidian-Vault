<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
**Archetype** [[Geomancer]]
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Requirements** You gained a terrain attunement benefit since the start of your most recent turn and that attunement matches the terrain you're in.

---
You're so attuned to the land that it rises up to protect you from a potentially fatal blow in a seeming coincidence. For instance, a branch suddenly falls from a nearby tree to take the brunt of a sword swing or a surprising change of current disrupts an enemy's attack. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to double your level against the triggering Strike.
