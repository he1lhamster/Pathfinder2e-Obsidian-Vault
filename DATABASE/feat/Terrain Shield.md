You're so attuned to the land that it rises up to protect you from a potentially fatal blow in a seeming coincidence. For instance, a branch suddenly falls from a nearby tree to take the brunt of a sword swing or a surprising change of current disrupts an enemy's attack. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to double your level against the triggering Strike.
