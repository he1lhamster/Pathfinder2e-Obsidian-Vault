You're the vassal or apprentice of a learned [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Naga|naga]], and you've studied the secrets of naga magic and concocting intricate poisons. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in your choice of Nagaji [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] or Naga Lore.
