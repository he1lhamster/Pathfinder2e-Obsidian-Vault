**Frequency** once per day
**Prerequisites** [[Chronoskimmer Dedication]]

---

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
