# Celestial Resistance <span class="item-type">Feat 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Aasimar</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]]

---
Your growing connection to your celestial forebears has granted you one of their resistances as well. Choose one of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type. 
Though you can choose any of these energy damage types, the damage type typically matches a celestial associated with your bloodline. For instance, an angelkin might choose resistance to cold or fire with a [[Cassisian (Archive Angel)]] forebear, resistance to fire with a [[Balisse (Confessor Angel)]] forebear, or resistance to sonic with a [[Choral (Choir Angel)]] forebear.
