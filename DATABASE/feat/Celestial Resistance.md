Your growing connection to your celestial forebears has granted you one of their resistances as well. Choose one of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type. 
Though you can choose any of these energy damage types, the damage type typically matches a celestial associated with your bloodline. For instance, an angelkin might choose resistance to cold or fire with a [[DATABASE/monster/Cassisian (Archive Angel)|cassisian]] forebear, resistance to fire with a [[DATABASE/monster/Balisse (Confessor Angel)|balisse]] forebear, or resistance to sonic with a [[DATABASE/monster/Choral (Choir Angel)|choral]] forebear.
