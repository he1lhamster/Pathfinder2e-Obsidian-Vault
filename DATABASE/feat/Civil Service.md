Everyone has a place and a role, and as long as those roles are filled, the government functions. When you select this feat, choose one leadership role; that role is now supported by your efficient civil servants, so its vacancy penalty is no longer applicable. If you wish to change the leadership role to which Civil Service applies, you can do so using the [[DATABASE/action/New Leadership|New Leadership]] activity at the start of a Kingdom turn.
 You gain a +2 status bonus to New Leadership checks.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
