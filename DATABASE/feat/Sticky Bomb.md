<span class="item-trait">Additive 2</span><span class="item-trait">Alchemist</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Frequency** once per round
**Trigger** You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical bomb, and that bomb’s level is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.

---
You mix in an additive to make your bomb’s contents adhere to the target and continue to deal damage. A creature that takes a direct hit from one of your sticky bombs also takes persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the bomb’s splash damage. If the bomb already deals persistent damage, combine the two amounts.

## Traits

**Additive 2:**

Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the [[DATABASE/feat/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level.
