You are skilled at making quick fixes to damaged equipment, but your fixes aren't meant to last forever. You make a quick repair to a [[Broken]] non-magical item in your possession. Until the item takes damage again, you can still use it as a shoddy item of its type. This repair restores no Hit Points, so the item is easy to destroy. Once the item is [[Repair]] normally such that it is no longer broken, it is also no longer shoddy.

## Traits
