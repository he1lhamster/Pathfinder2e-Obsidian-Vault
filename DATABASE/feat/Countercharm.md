**Source** [[Grand Bazaar]]

**Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell from the enchantment or illusion school.
**Requirements** You have an innate non-cantrip captivator spell of the same school.

Your enchantments and illusions are so dominant that you can use them to counteract similar magic cast by others. When a foe casts an enchantment or illusion spell and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own innate magic to disrupt it. You lose an innate, non-cantrip spell of the same school as the triggering spell as if you had Cast the Spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell with your spell.
