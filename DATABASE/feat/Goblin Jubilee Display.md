Flames and explosions sear the air in a riot of color and devastation that rivals that wrought by even the wildest goblin party. The display is both so beautiful and chaotic that, while mesmerizing, it poses a significant risk to the physical health, sight, and hearing of anyone who gets too close. You gain the Goblin Jubilee fireworks display.
 **Goblin Jubilee** <span class="action-icon">3</span> (fire, sonic, visual) **Cost** 3 batches of infused reagents; **Effect** Chaos fills a 20-foot burst within 120 feet. All creatures in the area takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 sonic damage and must attempt a Fortitude save. A goblin jubilee display costs 3 batches of infused reagents, rather than 1.
