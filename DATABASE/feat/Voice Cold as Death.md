---
Channeling the energy of the Crimson Oath into your voice, you pronounce a threat in a tone so icy it freezes the blood. Attempt an Intimidation check to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]]; you don't suffer a penalty if the target doesn't understand the language you're speaking, but this otherwise functions as normal. You can't use [[DATABASE/feat/Intimidating Glare|Intimidating Glare]] or any other effect that would cause your Demoralize attempt to lose the auditory trait as part of using this feat. If you critically succeed at your Intimidation check, the target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]], or stunned 2 if the target is undead. After using this feat, you are fatigued until the end of your next turn, and you can't use this feat again until the end of your next turn.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Auditory:**

Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deaf]] targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Emotion:**

This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.

**Fear:**

Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
