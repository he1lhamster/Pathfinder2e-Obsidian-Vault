The shock of seeing your ally near death breaks whatever limits exist in your mind, sending your power spilling forth. If your psyche is currently unleashed, you can immediately use a psyche action that takes 1 action or less to use. If your psyche is not currently unleashed, you [[DATABASE/action/Unleash Psyche|Unleash your Psyche]], which remains unleashed until the end of your next turn. You can ignore Unleash Psyche's requirement of needing to have Cast a Spell on your previous turn, but you still can't Unleash your Psyche if you're [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] or for 2 rounds after your psyche subsides.
