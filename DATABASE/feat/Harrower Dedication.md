<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Stolen Fate Player's Guide|Stolen Fate Player's Guide]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Harrower|Harrower]]
**Access** This feat is available to all players in a Stolen Fate campaign

---
You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]]; if you are already trained in this skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice instead. You also become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Fortune-Telling Lore]], and you learn the [[DATABASE/ritual/Harrowing|harrowing]] ritual.
 In addition, once a day when you perform your daily preparations, you can perform a harrow reading for yourself if you have access to a [[DATABASE/equipment/Harrow Deck|harrow deck]]. Draw a card from your harrow deck—that card's suit becomes your active harrow omen for the next 24 hours and modifies several other harrower feats as detailed on the following pages. You gain the Avoid Dire Fate reaction.
 **Avoid Dire Fate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (fortune) **Requirements** you have an active harrow omen; **Trigger** you fail or critically fail a check associated with your harrow omen's suit; **Effect** Treat the failure as a success or a critical failure as a failure. You no longer have an active harrow omen.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the harrower archetype. If you retrain out of this feat, you lose the _harrowing_ ritual you learned from it.
