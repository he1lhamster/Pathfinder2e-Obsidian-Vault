You are practiced at blending into the background of the streets and halls of larger folk to ensure that you are overlooked. When you are in a crowd or well trafficked urban area, you can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] and [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]], even when observed. On a success, you aren’t hidden or undetected, but other creatures simply don’t take particular notice of you, even though they can see you. You can’t use this ability on observers who have already seen you perform obtrusive or notable actions. If you perform any action other than to Hide or Sneak or otherwise take particularly salient actions (GM’s discretion), observers notice you right away.

## Traits

**Halfling:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the [[DATABASE/ancestry/Halfling|halfling]] ancestry. These small people are friendly wanderers considered to be lucky. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by halflings. A weapon with this trait is created and used by halflings.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
