Sharp shards of bone tear forth from your elbows, wrists, or other parts of your body. For 1 minute, you can make bone spike unarmed Strikes, which deal 1d6 piercing damage and have the versatile S and sweep trails. When you take the Bone Spikes action, you can choose one weapon on your person and duplicate its weapon runes onto your bone spikes (with the exception of any runes that couldn't apply to the bone spears).
**Awakening** Your bones grow longer, lashing flexibly at range. While you have bone spikes, you can Interact to give your bone spikes reach 10 feet until the end of the current turn.
**Awakening** Grooves in your bone spikes form a channel for venom. Your bone spikes deal 1d4 [[Persistent Damage]], which increases to 2d4 at 10th level and 3d4 at 18th level.

## Traits

**Deviant:**

This trait describes strange supernatural or paranormal abilities.

**Evocation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
 Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
