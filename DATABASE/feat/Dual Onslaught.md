When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack. When you use [[DATABASE/feat/Double Slice|Double Slice]], if you miss with both Strikes, choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.
