Disobeying your [[DATABASE/action/Iron Command|Iron Command]] has lasting consequences. If an enemy refuses to kneel to you, you can deal [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent mental damage]] instead of normal mental damage. You must decide whether the mental damage will be persistent before your enemy chooses whether to kneel or not. The amount of damage is unchanged.
