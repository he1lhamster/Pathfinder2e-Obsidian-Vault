Disobeying your [[Iron Command]] has lasting consequences. If an enemy refuses to kneel to you, you can deal [[Persistent Damage]] instead of normal mental damage. You must decide whether the mental damage will be persistent before your enemy chooses whether to kneel or not. The amount of damage is unchanged.

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
