You know that to take out an enemy formation, you must punch a hole through its center. Make a ranged Strike with the required weapon against a target within the weapon's first range increment. The target is pushed directly back 10 feet (20 feet on a critical hit), and if this pushes the target into an obstacle, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.
