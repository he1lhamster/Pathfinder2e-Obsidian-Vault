You've continued to expand your compendium of tools to compile knowledge. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Comprehend Language|comprehend language]], [[DATABASE/spell/Mindlink|mindlink]], and [[DATABASE/spell/Secret Page|secret page]] as innate occult spells, each once per day. When you cast _secret page_, it is automatically heightened to the same spell level as your cantrips from Magical Edification.
