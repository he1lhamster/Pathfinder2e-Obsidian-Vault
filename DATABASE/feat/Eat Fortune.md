**Frequency** once per day
**Trigger** A creature within 60 feet uses a fortune or misfortune effect.

---
As someone tries to twist fate, you consume the interference. The triggering effect is disrupted. If it's a misfortune effect, Eat Fortune gains the fortune trait; if it's a fortune effect, Eat Fortune gains the misfortune trait. This fortune or misfortune applies to the same roll the triggering effect would have, so you couldn't negate a fortune effect with Eat Fortune and then apply a misfortune effect to the same roll.
