With a wresting of will, you siphon off a creature's mental energy to replenish your own. One non-mindless creature within 30 feet must attempt a Will save against your spell DC.
**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is [[Stupefied]] for 1 minute, and you regain 1 Focus Point, up to your normal maximum. You can't use Brain Drain again until after the next time you make your daily preparations.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is stupefied 2.

## Traits

**Divination:**

The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Psyche:**

Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.
