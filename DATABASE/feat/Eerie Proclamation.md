**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Frequency** once per hour
**Prerequisites** expert in [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]]
**Requirements** You must be in either natural terrain or in abandoned or relatively unused artificial terrain (such as a darkened alley or haunted house).

---
You know there are places in the world that are just wrong— places where the birds don't sing and where you always feel like you're being watched. You can spot these places, and you can awaken them. To do so, you must gesture toward a 10-foot by 10- foot square you can see and make an ominous proclamation of some manner (i.e. “This is cursed ground,” “That is an ill-omened place.”). The next creature that enters the marked territory must attempt a Will save against your spell DC (if you're a druid) or class DC (if you're a ranger).
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** Something goes horribly awry for the victim in the cursed ground. The details are up to the GM—it can be a purely “natural” accident (they step into an old bear trap, perhaps) or something stranger and more spectral. The target gains a condition for 2 rounds. Roll 1d4 on the table and use the failure column to determine which condition.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the effect is astonishingly gruesome. Use the critical failure column, and the condition lasts for 1 minute.

## Traits

**Auditory:**

Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deaf]] targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Curse:**

A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses. 
Afflictions with this trait are manifestations of potent ill will. A curse either lasts a specified amount of time or can be removed only by certain actions a character must perform or conditions they must meet. A curse with stages follows the rules for afflictions. (_Gamemastery Guide_ pg. 251)

**Linguistic:**

An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Necromancy:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
