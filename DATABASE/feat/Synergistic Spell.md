You combine your synergy and spells into a fantastic web of magic, allowing you to cast two spells at once. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell from one of your halcyon spell slots, after that spell resolves, you can Cast another Spell as a free action. This spell must be cast from one of your halcyon spell slots and be a spell that would normally take two actions to cast.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
