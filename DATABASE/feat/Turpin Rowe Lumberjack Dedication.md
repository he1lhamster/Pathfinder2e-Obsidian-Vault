**Source** [[Pathfinder 153. Life's Long Shadows]]
**Archetype** [[Turpin Rowe Lumberjack]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Survival]]
**Access** You must befriend at least one Turpin Rowe logger.

---
Your logging training has made you intimately familiar with all aspects of forestry, and you have trained extensively to reach around trees and utilize their bulk to your advantage. You become trained in [[Lore]] and Forest Lore, or an expert if you were already trained. You can always [[Take Cover]] when you are within forest terrain to gain cover, even if you’re not next to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind. In addition, any enemy who gains standard cover from a tree gains only lesser cover against your attacks (or only standard cover, if the enemy otherwise gains greater cover).
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Turpin Rowe lumberjack archetype.
