Even when things go poorly in other areas, you can count on consistency in carrying out kingdom activities with a chosen skill. Choose one Kingdom skill in which your kingdom is trained. Once per Kingdom turn, when you would attempt a skill check for that skill, you can forgo rolling and instead take a result equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus; do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers to this result.
**Special** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different skill and gain the benefits of this feat for that skill.

## Traits

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
