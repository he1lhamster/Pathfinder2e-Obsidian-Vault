---
A condensed burst of flame shoots behind you, propelling you forward with its sheer force. Stride up to 40 feet in a straight line. Movement from this impulse ignores difficult terrain and doesn't trigger reactions.

---
**Level (6th)** The maximum distance of the Stride is 60 feet. You can choose to [[DATABASE/action/Leap|Leap]] up to 40 feet in any direction instead of Striding. If you're in the air at the end of this Leap, you fall normally.
**Level (10th)** As 6th level, but you hover briefly after leaping into the air. If you Leap, you don't fall until the end of your next turn. If you use Burning Jet again on a subsequent turn, you remain airborne.

## Traits

**Fire:**

Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
