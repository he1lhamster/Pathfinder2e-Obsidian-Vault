As stubborn in death as you are in life, you vow you'll never aid your hated enemies. You can't be transformed into an undead, except by effects that originate from an artifact or deity. Undead creatures that touch your corpse take 1 positive damage each time they do, or 1d6 positive damage each time they expose themselves to your corpse in a more thorough manner, such as by biting or carrying your corpse.

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill.
