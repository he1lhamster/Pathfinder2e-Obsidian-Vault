---
You bear a grudge, inherited from a blasphemous [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Asura|asura]] forebear in your bloodline, against a particular deity and their works. You also have some vestigial signs of your previous incarnation, such as a second set of shoulder blades without usable arms, a set of mostly closed eyes where no eyes belong, or strange scarring reminiscent of a mouth.
 You gain the Find Fault reaction.
 **Find Fault** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (concentrate) **Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a spell or magic effect but haven't rolled yet; **Effect** You find some kind of fault with the magic, using that flaw to protect yourself from the effect. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect, which increases to a +2 circumstance bonus if the effect is divine and originates from a worshipper of the deity you chose for your grudge.
