**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm.

---
You command the room, firing a gun into the air and ordering everyone to surrender and put their hands in the air. You fire your firearm and then attempt a single [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet. Creatures who become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] instinctively put their hands in the air. If they had Raised a Shield, they lose the benefits, as they raise the shield above their head where it's of little use to block attacks. With their hands in the air, each of these frightened creatures can't use reactions or free actions that require their hands, or items held in their hands, until the beginning of their next turn. Regardless of the result, each creature is then temporarily immune to Reach for the Sky for 1 minute.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Auditory:**

Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deaf]] targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.

**Visual:**

A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.
