You're a treasure trove of information, but not all of it comes from reputable sources. When you fail (but don't critically fail) a [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check using any skill, you learn a bit of true knowledge and a bit of erroneous knowledge, but you don't have any way to differentiate which is which.
