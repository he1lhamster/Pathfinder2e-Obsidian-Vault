You are keen to the wiles of the fey and can usually shake off their magic. Whenever you fail, but don't critically fail, a save against a spell with a duration of at least 1 round cast by a fey creature, you can attempt a second save against the original DC at the start of your next turn to end any lingering effects the spell might have. This can end [[Persistent Damage]] caused by a spell but can't reverse any effects that have been resolved already (such as damage dealt when the spell was cast).

## Traits

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
