When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes 1d8 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|major striking]] weapon). The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.
