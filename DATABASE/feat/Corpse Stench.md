**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]

* This archetype offers Corpse Stench at a different level than displayed here.

---
Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a 10-foot emanation, so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be [[Sickened]] (plus slowed 1 on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Aura:**

An aura is an emanation that continually ebbs out from you, affecting creatures within a certain radius. Aura can also refer to the magical signature of an item or a creature with a strong alignment.

An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it. This applies only to olfactory parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.
