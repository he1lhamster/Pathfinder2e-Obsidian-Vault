---
You trust your instincts and your sense of smell, using all of your senses to pinpoint your opponent's location. Make a melee Strike against an opponent that isn't hiding its scent with an effect like [[DATABASE/spell/Negate Aroma|negate aroma]]. This attack ignores any flat check required due to the target being [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]].
