**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Prerequisites** [[Acute Scent]], or precise or imprecise scent

---
You trust your instincts and your sense of smell, using all of your senses to pinpoint your opponent's location. Make a melee Strike against an opponent that isn't hiding its scent with an effect like [[Negate Aroma]]. This attack ignores any flat check required due to the target being [[Concealed]] or [[Hidden]].

## Traits

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
