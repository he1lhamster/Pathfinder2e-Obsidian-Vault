You unleash the energy roiling within you, exploding elemental matter in a 15-foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes 1d8 damage per level you possess, with the same type you chose for elemental rage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic Reflex save against your class DC. Elemental Explosion gains the trait of your element.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
