Years of experience among ratfolk communities have made you nimble, and you've learned to run and hide when enemies threaten. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Ratfolk Lore]].
