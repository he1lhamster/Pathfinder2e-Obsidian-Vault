**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]]

---
Years of experience among ratfolk communities have made you nimble, and you've learned to run and hide when enemies threaten. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Acrobatics]] and [[Stealth]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[Lore]].
