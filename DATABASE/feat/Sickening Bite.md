Your saliva causes severe nausea and mild fever in the living, weakening them so that you can more easily finish them off. When you critically hit a creature with your jaws, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. This is a disease effect.
 If you are satiated, you can end your satiation to make the target sickened 1 on a regular hit instead.
