You can hide a small object of up to light Bulk inside a hollow cavity on one of your forearms. It takes three Interact actions to store an object in this way. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to the DCs of checks for others to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] or [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]] objects stored inside your arm. If you store a weapon in your arm, you can use a single action to Interact to draw the weapon into the hand corresponding to your internal cavity, then Strike with the weapon.
