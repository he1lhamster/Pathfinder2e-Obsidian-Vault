Despite a lifetime filled with questionable decisions, you've managed to survive, as though you have uncanny luck that lets you avoid the consequences of your own actions. For the remainder of your turn, if you roll a failure or critical failure on a saving throw against a harmful effect, you get a success instead. Further, enemies and hazards that would damage you this turn roll the minimum possible damage.
 These benefits apply only to harmful effects incurred entirely during your turn in which you activate Reckless Abandon, such as running through a [[DATABASE/spell/Prismatic Wall|prismatic wall]]. Persistent damage and conditions that were applied prior to your turn proceed normally, and as soon as your turn ends you are subject to the full consequences of any dangers still threatening you.

## Traits

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Goblin:**

A creature with this trait can be one of several kinds of creature, including [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblins]], [[DATABASE/ancestry/Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]], and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Bugbear|bugbears]]. Goblins tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins. A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.
