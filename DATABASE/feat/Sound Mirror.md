You twist not just the visual, but the auditory as well, allowing you to pass without a sound and create minor noises as distractions—perfect for misdirection and infiltration. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Silence|silence]] on yourself as a 2nd-level innate occult spell and [[DATABASE/spell/Ventriloquism|ventriloquism]] as a 1st-level innate occult spell, both once per day. You also can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Ghost Sound|ghost sound]] as an innate occult cantrip. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.
