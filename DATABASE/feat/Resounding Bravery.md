Even your fears serve as fuel for your fighting spirit. When you critically succeed at a Will save against a foe's ability, you gain a +1 status bonus to saves and a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level for 1 minute. These benefits are doubled if you critically succeed against a fear effect.
