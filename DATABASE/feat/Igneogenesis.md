You can create a permanent stone object, either sculpting stone pulled directly from your kinetic gate or manipulating earth and stone around you. It must fit within one 5-foot cube that's adjacent to you and on solid ground, and you can make the object large enough to occupy the square. If you create the object underneath you or another willing creature, you cause the target to rise on top of the object; you can't create it under an unwilling creature. This impulse has an unlimited duration, but if you use Igneogenesis again, the object returns to its original location or form. You can spend 1 hour to use Igneogenesis as an [[Exploration]] activity; in this case, the object is permanent and non-magical.
 The object can't include any intricate parts or moving pieces. You can attempt a [[Crafting]] skill check as part of using this impulse to add details to your creation, such as a symbol, short message, or pattern (with the DC determined by the GM).

**Level (+3)** You can add an additional 5-foot cube to the object. Each cube must be contiguous.

## Traits

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
