You carry scraps of materials dangerous to undead and can apply them to your weapon. When you use Slayer's Strike, before making the Strike, you can choose either the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] property rune or a precious material: [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Darkwood Weapon|darkwood]], or [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|silver]]. Any Strike that gets extra positive damage from this use of Slayer's Strike also gets the benefits of the rune or counts as that material.
 At 14th level, add [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Weapon|adamantine]] and [[DATABASE/equipment/Mithral Weapon|mithral]] to the list of materials you can choose from.
