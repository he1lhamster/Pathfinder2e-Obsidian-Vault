# Slayer's Blessing <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Manipulate</span>
**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Archetype** [[Undead Slayer]]
**Prerequisites** [[Slayer's Strike]]

---
You carry scraps of materials dangerous to undead and can apply them to your weapon. When you use Slayer's Strike, before making the Strike, you can choose either the [[Ghost Touch]] property rune or a precious material: [[Cold Iron Weapon]], [[Darkwood Weapon]], or [[Silver Weapon]]. Any Strike that gets extra positive damage from this use of Slayer's Strike also gets the benefits of the rune or counts as that material.
 At 14th level, add [[Adamantine Weapon]] and [[Mithral Weapon]] to the list of materials you can choose from.
