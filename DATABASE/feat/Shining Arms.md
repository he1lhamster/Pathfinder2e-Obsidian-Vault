When you cast _light_, you can modify its target to be 1 melee weapon, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally, and modify its duration to be 1 minute. If you do, add the following to its effects: When a creature wielding the weapon critically hits a foe, you can Dismiss the Spell as a reaction, causing the foe to be [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round. After you use this reaction, you can't use this modification again for 10 minutes.
