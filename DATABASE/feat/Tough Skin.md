Your skin is medium armor in the [[Plate]] armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, and has a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a Speed penalty of –5 feet, a Strength value of 16, and the comfort trait. You can never wear other armor or remove your hide. You can etch armor runes onto your hide.
