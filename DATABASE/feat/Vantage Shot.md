You and your spotter take advantage of each other's attacks to momentarily hide and throw your foes off-balance against your follow-up attack. When you successfully make a ranged Strike against a foe, your spotter can use a reaction to attempt a [[Stealth]] check against the foe's Perception DC. On a success, the foe is [[Flat-Footed]] against the spotter's next attack before the end of your spotter's next turn. Similarly, when your spotter successfully makes a ranged Strike against a foe, you can use a reaction to attempt a Stealth check against the foe's Perception DC. On a success, the foe is flat-footed against your next attack against them before the end of your next turn.
