You sense chaos as an unsettling feeling of nervous energy. When in the presence of an aura of chaos that is powerful or overwhelming, you eventually detect the aura, though you might not do so instantly and you can’t pinpoint the location. This is a vague sense, similar to humans’ sense of smell. A chaotic creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a [[Deception]] check against your Perception DC to hide its aura from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is temporarily immune to your Sense Chaos for 1 day.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

### Alignment Aura

The strength of an alignment aura depends on the level of the creature, item, or spell. The auras of undead, clerics and other divine spellcasters with a patron deity, and creatures from the Outer Sphere are one step stronger than normal (faint instead of none, for example).

## Alignment Aura
