You gain a skill feat and the rogue’s surprise attack class feature. You become trained in light armor. In addition, you become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] plus one skill of your choice; if you are already trained in both Stealth and Thievery, you become trained in an additional skill of your choice. You become trained in rogue class DC.
