You are quick to capitalize on your distractions. If you critically succeed at your check to [[Create a Diversion]] against the majority of the creatures (at least half of the creatures) whose attention you're trying to divert, you can use your reaction to immediately [[Hide]], [[Sneak]], or Step. As normal, you are only [[Hidden]] to creatures against which you succeed on your check to Create a Diversion, even if you manage to Hide or Sneak away.

## Traits

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat.
