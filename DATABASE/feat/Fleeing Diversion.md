You are quick to capitalize on your distractions. If you critically succeed at your check to [[DATABASE/action/Create a Diversion|Create a Distraction]] against the majority of the creatures (at least half of the creatures) whose attention you're trying to divert, you can use your reaction to immediately [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]], [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]], or Step. As normal, you are only [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to creatures against which you succeed on your check to Create a Diversion, even if you manage to Hide or Sneak away.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
