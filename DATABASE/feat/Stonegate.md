Earthen barriers no longer impede your progress. You gain [[DATABASE/spell/Passwall|passwall]] as a 7th-level divine innate spell that you can cast once per day. Unlike the spell, however, this ability can be used only to open passages through barriers of earth or stone.

## Traits

**Dwarf:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the dwarf ancestry. Dwarves are stout folk who often live underground and typically have [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by dwarves. An item with this trait is created and used by dwarves.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
