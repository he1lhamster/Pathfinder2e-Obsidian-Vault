You grew up riding your clan's shaggy ponies and riding dogs. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]]. If you would automatically become trained in Nature (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also get a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] if the target is a traditional halfling mount, such as a [[DATABASE/monster/Riding Pony|pony]] or [[DATABASE/monster/Riding Dog|riding dog]].
