You grew up riding your clan's shaggy ponies and riding dogs. You become trained in [[Nature]]. If you would automatically become trained in Nature (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also get a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Command an Animal]] if the target is a traditional halfling mount, such as a [[Riding Pony]] or [[Riding Dog]].
