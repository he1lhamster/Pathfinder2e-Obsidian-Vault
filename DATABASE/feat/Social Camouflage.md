You have the uncanny ability to quickly blend into the lifestyle of whatever settlement in which you find yourself. After residing in a particular settlement for at least 1 day, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] to pass yourself off as a resident of that settlement. Additionally, you can use [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] in place of [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Gather Information|Gather Information]] while in that settlement. The GM might decide you need more time in particularly large settlements to gain these benefits, or might decide you gain the benefits only while in a specific district or part of the settlement.
