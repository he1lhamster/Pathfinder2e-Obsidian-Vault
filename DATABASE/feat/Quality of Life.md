Your kingdom's robust economy makes the creature comforts of civilization more readily available to all, and even finer luxuries are more easily had. The first time you gain Luxury Commodities in a Kingdom turn, increase the total gained by 1. All of your settlements are treated as 1 level higher than their actual level for the purposes of determining what sorts of magic items might be offered for sale at their markets and shops.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
