You are able to weave your words in such a way that you never use actual lies, but still mislead people to certain conclusions. You can attempt to make a [[DATABASE/action/Request|Request]] of a creature using Deception instead of Diplomacy. You can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]] to a creature using [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] instead of Deception.
