Taller folk rarely pay attention to the shadows at their feet, and you take full advantage of this. You can move 5 feet farther when you take the [[Sneak]] action, up to your Speed. In addition, as long as you continue to use Sneak actions and succeed at your [[Stealth]] check, you don't become [[Observed]] if you don't have cover or greater cover and aren't [[Concealed]] at the end of the Sneak action, as long as you have cover or greater cover or are concealed at the end of your turn.
