You've learned a few tricks to ensure you find every last magic item and interesting magical effect during your missions. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Read Aura|read aura]] as innate spells at will. You can also cast [[DATABASE/spell/Locate|locate]] as an innate spell once per day, but only to locate magic items, not specific mundane objects or types of objects. If you could already cast spells, these spells are of the same tradition. Otherwise, they're arcane spells, you use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for arcane spells.
 When you cast _detect magic_ or _read aura_ from this feat on an item or creature under the effect of a [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Aura|magic aura]] spell or interact with an item under the effect of an [[DATABASE/spell/Item Facade|item facade]] spell, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your check to disbelieve the illusion.
