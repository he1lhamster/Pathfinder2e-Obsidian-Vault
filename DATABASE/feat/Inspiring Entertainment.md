<span class="item-trait">General</span><span class="item-trait">Kingdom</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Prerequisites** Culture 14

---
Your kingdom's artists and entertainers are talented and prolific, and there's never a shortage of new plays, operas, novels, music, sculptures, paintings, or other forms of distraction to entertain the citizens, even during times of upheaval. When you check for Unrest during the Upkeep phase of a Kingdom turn, you may roll a Culture-based check rather than a Loyalty-based check to determine the outcome. Your kingdom also gains a +2 status bonus to all Culture-based skill checks whenever your kingdom has at least 1 Unrest.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
