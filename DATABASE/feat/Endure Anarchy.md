Your kingdom holds together even in the midst of extreme peril. If your kingdom's Unrest is 6 or higher and you use a kingdom activity that decreases Unrest, decrease the Unrest by an additional 1. You do not fall into anarchy unless your kingdom's Unrest reaches 24 (see last paragraph of Step 2: Adjust Unrest on page 538).

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
