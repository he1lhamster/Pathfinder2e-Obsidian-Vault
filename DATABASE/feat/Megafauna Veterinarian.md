By heeding the wise advice of elders in your following— and aided by your own experience—you've learned how to provide medical care to the megafauna of the Mammoth Lord followings. You can attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] check instead of a [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check for any of Medicine's trained and untrained uses, provided the subject of your medical care is a megafauna. If you're attempting an action that requires a particular proficiency rank in Medicine (such as [[DATABASE/action/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]), use your proficiency rank in Nature instead. If the subject of your care is your megafauna and you roll a success on your check, you get a critical success instead.
