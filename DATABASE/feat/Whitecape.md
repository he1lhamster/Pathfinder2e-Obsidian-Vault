**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]

---
You're shorter and wider than many vanaras of your heritage, and the hair on your shoulders and your head is particularly thick and luxurious, like a majestic cape. This hair grows back supernaturally quickly if shorn. You gain the [[Steady Balance]] skill feat, even if you aren't trained in [[Acrobatics]], and you can Step into difficult terrain caused by uneven ground.
**Special** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of or into this feat.

## Traits

**Vanara:**

Vanaras are monkeylike humanoids who share a devotion to monastic training.
