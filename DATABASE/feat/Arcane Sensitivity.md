You can sense the presence of the supernatural, even if you don't have any magical ability yourself. You can spend a single action (this action has the concentrate trait) to determine if any magical auras are present in the area. This has the effects of a 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] spell but isn't magical. By straining, you can also discover the source of the magic and its school (with the effect of a 4th-level _detect magic_ spell), but doing so prevents you from using this ability again until you've rested for 8 hours.
