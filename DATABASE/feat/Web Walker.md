You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves and AC against the [[DATABASE/spell/Web|web]] spell, natural webbing, and effects that entrap you in webbing, as well as a +1 circumstance bonus against other effects that snare and entangle you, like the [[DATABASE/spell/Entangle|entangle]] spell. Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an effect involving a web, you get a critical success instead.
