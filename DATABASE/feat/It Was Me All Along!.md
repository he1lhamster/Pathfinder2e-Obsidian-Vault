---
You discard a disguise and dramatically reveal your true identity, catching your foes off guard. If you created your disguise using magic such as with [[Humanoid Form]] or [[Illusory Disguise]], you immediately Dismiss the spell as a free action. Stride up to your speed and attempt a [[Deception]] check to [[Feint]] one target within 30 feet. If you succeed, you roll twice and take the better result on your first attack roll against that target this turn.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
