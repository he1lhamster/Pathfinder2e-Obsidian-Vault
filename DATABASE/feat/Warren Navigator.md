You're particularly good at solving mazes and navigating twists and turns. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]]. If you would automatically become trained in Survival (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice. When you [[DATABASE/action/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]] or attempt a roll against a [[DATABASE/spell/Maze|maze]] spell, you get a result one degree of success better than you rolled. You don't take a penalty to Sense Direction when you lack a [[DATABASE/equipment/Compass|compass]].
