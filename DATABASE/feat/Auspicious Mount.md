Guided by your ongoing care, your steed has developed incredible intelligence and skill. The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a specialized animal companion. You can select one of the usual specializations or the auspice specialization.
 Auspice mounts gain the following benefits: Your companion is marked by your deity's religious symbol as a sacred creature of your deity. Its proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] increases to expert, it can speak the language associated with your deity's servitors (Celestial for champions who follow the tenets of good), and its Intelligence modifier increases by 2 and its Wisdom modifier by 1.
