Sorrina Westyr (_Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide_ page 46) took up the mantle of dean of the school of Spells to replace her predecessor Aram Zey, who had originally been her replacement. When Aram Zey was lost to the magic of the extradimensional demiplane known as the Hao Jin Tapestry, Sorrina began teaching an advanced studies course in extradimensional and interplanar phenomena, hoping to both prevent future losses and better prepare her students for the unexpected challenges that may await them in their careers as Pathfinder agents.
