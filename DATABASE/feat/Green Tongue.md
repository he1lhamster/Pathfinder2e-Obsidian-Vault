You share a special kinship with all things green and living. You (and your leshy familiar, if you have one) are constantly under the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Speak with Plants|speak with plants]]. Most non-creature plants recognize you as a druid of the [[DATABASE/druidicorder/Leaf|leaf order]] and are friendly to you.
