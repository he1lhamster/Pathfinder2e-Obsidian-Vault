---
You were once a shapeshifter or spellcaster using polymorph magic, but something went wrong, and you became trapped in the form of the creature you were imitating. This accident might have drained your power, or you might have retained some of your skills, but either way, your form resists further forced transformation. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against transmutation effects, and if you roll a success on a saving throw against a hostile morph or polymorph effect, you get a critical success instead.

## Traits

**Lineage:**

A feat with this trait indicates a character's descendance from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat. You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of these feats.

**Reflection:**

A creature with this trait has the [[DATABASE/ancestry/Reflection|reflection]] versatile heritage. Reflections are beings who are copies of living people, whether through cloning, planar duplication, or another mechanism. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by reflections.
