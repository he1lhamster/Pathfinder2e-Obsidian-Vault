Deep understanding of divine revelations into the nature of vital essence allows you to freely manipulate the effects of your positive or negative energy. Use 1 metamagic action that you can perform that normally takes 1 action and can be applied to the [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] spell. If you use it in this way, its effects apply only to a _harm_ or _heal_ spell.
