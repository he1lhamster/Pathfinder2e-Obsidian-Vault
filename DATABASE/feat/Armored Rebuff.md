You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back your foe. Attempt an [[Athletics]] check to [[Shove]] the triggering foe, even if you don't have a hand free. If you succeed, you can't Stride to follow the foe, as you're knocking the foe back with the rebounded attack, not by physically moving towards them.
