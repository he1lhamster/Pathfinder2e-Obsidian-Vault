Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion and gaining additional capabilities. If you have the [[Hunt Prey]] action, your animal companion assaults the prey even without your orders. During an encounter, even if you don't use the [[Command an Animal]] action, your animal companion can still use 1 action that round on your turn to Stride toward or Strike your prey.
