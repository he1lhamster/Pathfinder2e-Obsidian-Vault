Denizens of the [[Plane of Wood]] take immense pride in the magnificent works of art they can craft from wood, and practicing your own woodcraft helps you feel a connection with your planar heritage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Crafting]]. If you would automatically become trained in Crafting (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[Specialty Crafting]] skill feat for woodworking.
