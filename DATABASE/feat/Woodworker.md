Denizens of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]] take immense pride in the magnificent works of art they can craft from wood, and practicing your own woodcraft helps you feel a connection with your planar heritage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]]. If you would automatically become trained in Crafting (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat for woodworking.
