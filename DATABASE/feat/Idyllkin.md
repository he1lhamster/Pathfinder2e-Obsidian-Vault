Your wild, unique features betray your [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Agathion|agathion]] birthright. Serene celestials from the plane of [[DATABASE/plane/Nirvana|Nirvana]], agathions seek the peaceful path, ensuring a better world for all to coexist. Your halcyon demeanor leads you to search for peaceful resolution to conflict. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]]. If you would automatically become trained in Nature (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You know the [[DATABASE/language/Sylvan|Sylvan]] language and gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Natural Medicine|Natural Medicine]] skill feat.
