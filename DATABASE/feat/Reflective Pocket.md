You've formed a connection with a small hand mirror, allowing you to use it as an extradimensional storage space. You can store one item of light Bulk in your mirror at a time. Storing or retrieving an item requires an Interact action and any creature can do so. While an item is stored within the mirror, the mirror reflects the item's image. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]] unless someone checks the mirror's reflection.

## Traits

**Extradimensional:**

This effect or item creates an extradimensional space. An extradimensional effect placed inside another extradimensional space ceases to function until it is removed.

**Reflection:**

A creature with this trait has the [[DATABASE/ancestry/Reflection|reflection]] versatile heritage. Reflections are beings who are copies of living people, whether through cloning, planar duplication, or another mechanism. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by reflections.
