Your experience chronicling adventures and discoveries grants you heightened discernment and memory. For 24 hours after learning a prominent fact—such as the name of an NPC you have met, the details of your mission briefing, and similar information—you can recall it without attempting a check, though this doesn’t allow you to automatically memorize long strings of numbers or text. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to remember a detail that has come up before in the current adventure, even if it was more than 24 hours ago.
 If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Thorough Reports|Thorough Reports]] feat and have expert proficiency in the skill you’re using to Recall Knowledge, your circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about creatures from that feat increases to +4.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Scrollmaster archetype.
