Your parries and finishers allow you to riposte with the slightest provocation. You can use [[DATABASE/action/Opportune Riposte|Opportune Riposte]] against an enemy who fails at a Strike against you (not just critically fails), provided you have both damaged that creature with a finisher on your last turn and currently have a circumstance bonus to AC from the parry weapon trait, [[DATABASE/feat/Dueling Parry (Swashbuckler)|Dueling Parry]], or [[DATABASE/feat/Twin Parry|Twin Parry]].
