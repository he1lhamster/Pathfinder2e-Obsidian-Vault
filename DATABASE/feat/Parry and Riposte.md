Your parries and finishers allow you to riposte with the slightest provocation. You can use [[Opportune Riposte]] against an enemy who fails at a Strike against you (not just critically fails), provided you have both damaged that creature with a finisher on your last turn and currently have a circumstance bonus to AC from the parry weapon trait, [[Dueling Parry (Swashbuckler)]], or [[Twin Parry]].
