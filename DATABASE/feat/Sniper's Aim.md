You take an extra moment to carefully sync your aim and breathing, then fire a shot with great accuracy. Make a ranged weapon Strike. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this Strike's attack roll and ignore the target's concealment. If you're using a kickback firearm, you don't take the normal circumstance penalty on this Strike for not having the required Strength score or firing without using a stabilizer.
