---
Your vassals take their duty to protect those under their stewardship seriously, and your engineers emphasize the value of a strong defense when it comes to building settlements and fortifications. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks attempted as part of the Fortify Hex activity and on activities to build or repair a Barracks, Castle, Garrison, Keep, Stone Wall, or Wooden Wall. In addition, you gain a +1 status bonus to all kingdom checks attempted during dangerous events that directly impact your settlements' defenses.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
