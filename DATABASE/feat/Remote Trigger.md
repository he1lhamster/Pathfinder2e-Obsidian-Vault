You've learned how to trigger snares from afar, creating ranged hazards to assail your opponents and allowing you to disarm enemies' snares harmlessly. You can Strike a snare to trigger it prematurely. If you crafted the snare, you automatically hit. If someone else crafted it, attempt a ranged Strike against the [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] DC, triggering the snare only if you hit.
