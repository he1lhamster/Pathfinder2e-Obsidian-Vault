Elves are often skeptical of their half-elven kin, and you are experienced at telling stories of your accomplishments to gain their respect. You are trained in [[Performance]]. If you would automatically become trained in Performance (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
 You gain the [[Impressive Performance]] feat. When you attempt a Performance check to [[Make an Impression]] on an elf, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.

## Traits

**Half-Elf:**

A creature with this trait is part [[Human]] and part [[Elf]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by half-elves.
