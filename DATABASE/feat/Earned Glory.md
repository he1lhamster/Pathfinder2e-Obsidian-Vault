Elves are often skeptical of their half-elven kin, and you are experienced at telling stories of your accomplishments to gain their respect. You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]]. If you would automatically become trained in Performance (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
 You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Impressive Performance|Impressive Performance]] feat. When you attempt a Performance check to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on an elf, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.

## Traits
