You're adept at making contact with other ysoki. When you arrive at a new settlement, you automatically find the nearest ratfolk enclave by spending 1 day of downtime searching, provided one exists and its members aren't actively hiding from you. Once you've made contact, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Gather Information|Gather Information]] and [[DATABASE/action/Earn Income|Earn Income]] in the settlement.
