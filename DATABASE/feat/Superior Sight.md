Your senses are peerless. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks, and you gain low-light vision. If you already have low-light vision, gain darkvision instead. Furthermore, when you target an enemy, you automatically succeed at the flat check if that enemy is concealed, hidden, or undetected.
