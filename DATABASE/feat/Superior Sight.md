Your senses are peerless. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks, and you gain low-light vision. If you already have low-light vision, gain darkvision instead. Furthermore, when you target an enemy, you automatically succeed at the flat check if that enemy is concealed, hidden, or undetected.

## Traits

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
