Your unpredictable gunfire often catches enemies off guard or hits unprotected areas. Make a ranged Strike with a firearm against a creature that you haven't already attacked on this turn. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage on this Strike equal to the number of weapon damage dice. The Strike gains the following failure effect.
**Failure** The firearm misfires, but it doesn't cause the other critical failure effects listed below.
**Critical Failure** The firearm misfires and also explodes. It becomes [[Broken]], and it deals its normal weapon damage to all creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the firearm, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. This damage includes any from the weapon's fundamental and property runes.
