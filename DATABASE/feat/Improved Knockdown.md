# Improved Knockdown <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Fighter</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Mauler|Mauler]]*
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Knockdown|Knockdown]]
* This archetype offers Improved Knockdown at a different level than displayed here.

---
You can dash your foe to the ground with a single blow. When you use Knockdown, instead of making a Strike followed by a [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]], you can attempt a single Strike. If you do and your Strike hits, instead of rolling a check for your Trip attempt, you automatically apply the critical success effect of a Trip. If you used a two-handed melee weapon for the Strike, you can use the weapon's damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical Trip.

## Archetype Use
