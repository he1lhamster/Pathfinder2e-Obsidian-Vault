You have learned Artokus Kirran's most hidden secrets, granting you the ability to create alchemy infused with the power of wishes. Once per day when you use advanced alchemy during your daily preparations, you can spend a batch of infused reagents to create a wish vial containing a single common arcane spell of your choice of 8th level or lower. The spell must have a casting time of no more than 3 actions, no Cost, and must be able to target you. Only you can Activate the wish vial, which takes the same number of Interact actions as the spell's casting time and grants you the effects of the spell.

## Traits

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

### Artokus's Discoveries

**Source** [[Legends]]
Artokus Kirran's legacy includes far more than just the sun orchid elixir. As one of the longest-lived alchemists in Golarion, he's developed a number of other significant alchemical discoveries known across the Inner Sea region. The following are some of his more notable discoveries. Artokus is cautious about sharing his alchemical techniques and typically only does so with his most trusted students.
