Your mastery of alchemical secrets enables you to replicate effects most believe can be achieved only via magic. Select a number of potions equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); these potions must be of 9th level or lower. You gain formulas to create these potions as alchemical items with the elixir trait. When making these alchemical elixirs, you can substitute alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical components, and you can use [[Alchemist's Tools]] (for [[Quick Alchemy]]) or an [[Alchemist's Lab]] (for the [[Craft]] activity) instead of any other required tool kits. Other than that, the formula does not change. Once you've chosen the potion formulas, they can't be changed.
