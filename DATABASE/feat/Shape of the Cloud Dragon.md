You've discovered how to transform yourself into a cloud dragon. Once per day, you can cast 7th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Dragon Form|dragon form]] as an innate arcane spell, transforming into a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Cloud|cloud dragon]]. The spell automatically heightens to 8th level if you're 16th level and 9th level if you're 18th level. On a critical hit with an unarmed Strike gained from _dragon form_, you recharge the spell's breath weapon immediately.
 While in this form, you gain the following cloud dragon–specific abilities:

* **Cloud** cloud walk (you can walk on clouds or fog); **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws, **Damage** 2d10 piercing plus 1d12 electricity; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw (agile), **Damage** 3d10 slashing; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> tail (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d10 bludgeoning; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> horn (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d8 piercing; breath weapon 30-foot cone, 6d12 electricity.

**Special** You can use this feat in place of [[DATABASE/feat/Shape of the Dragon|Shape of the Dragon]] to fulfill feat requirements.
