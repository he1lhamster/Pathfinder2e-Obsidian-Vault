Your family's traditions of defending against Geb's undead have granted you a sixth sense for detecting spirits, haunts, and other restless dead, no matter their form or the strength of their presence. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] when trying to determine if a creature is possessed or under the influence of an effect that would make them [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]], a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks made to see through disguises worn by undead, and a +2 circumstance bonus when using the Seek action to find [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] haunts or undead within 30 feet of you.
 If you aren't using the [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] action or searching, the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice haunts or undead within 30 feet anyway. This check doesn't gain the usual +2 circumstance bonus, and instead takes a –2 circumstance penalty.
