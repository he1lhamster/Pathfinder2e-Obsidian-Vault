# Frighten Undead <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Archetype** [[Undead Slayer]]
**Prerequisites** [[Undead Slayer Dedication]]; trained in [[Intimidation]]

---
Your very presence chills creatures of the night down to their core and you can use the spiritual power and faithful life force of religious verses to frighten even mindless undead. Attempt to [[Demoralize]] an undead target using your [[Religion]] modifier instead of your [[Intimidation]] modifier if it's higher. If you use your Religion modifier, the Demoralize action loses the emotion and mental traits, as your faith connects to the undead on an instinctual level.
