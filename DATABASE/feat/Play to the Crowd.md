On a success, choose one of the following benefits; on a critical success, choose two benefits:

* A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your character level; these last for 1 minute.
* A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
* A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your next turn.
