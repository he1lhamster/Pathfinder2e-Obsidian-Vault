You remember the revelry of the Night Parade and call them to your aid in a riotous display. You [[DATABASE/action/Perform|Perform]] and cast 8th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Mad Monkeys|mad monkeys]] three times, except that the spell calls various apparitions such as dancing [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Tsukumogami|tsukumogami]] or drinking [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Oni|oni]] rather than monkeys. Each casting can produce a different kind of mischief. You can Sustain all three Spells each round using a single Perform action.
