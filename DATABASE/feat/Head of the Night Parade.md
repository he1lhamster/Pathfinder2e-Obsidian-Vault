You remember the revelry of the Night Parade and call them to your aid in a riotous display. You [[Perform]] and cast 8th-level [[Mad Monkeys]] three times, except that the spell calls various apparitions such as dancing [[Tsukumogami]] or drinking [[Oni]] rather than monkeys. Each casting can produce a different kind of mischief. You can Sustain all three Spells each round using a single Perform action.
