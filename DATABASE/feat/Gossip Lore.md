Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed on every topic. You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Gossip Lore]], a special Lore skill that can be used only to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Gossip Lore, you get the effects of the [[DATABASE/feat/Dubious Knowledge|Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
 If you have legendary proficiency in [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]], you gain expert proficiency in Gossip Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Gossip Lore by any other means.
