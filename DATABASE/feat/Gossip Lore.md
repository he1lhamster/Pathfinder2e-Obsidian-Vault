Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed on every topic. You are trained in [[Lore]], a special Lore skill that can be used only to [[Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Gossip Lore, you get the effects of the [[Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
 If you have legendary proficiency in [[Society]], you gain expert proficiency in Gossip Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Gossip Lore by any other means.
