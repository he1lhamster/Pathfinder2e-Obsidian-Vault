---
You attack carefully to knock some sense into a creature whose actions aren't their own. Make a Strike against a [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] ally. The Strike is nonlethal and doesn't take a –2 penalty for using a weapon without the nonlethal trait; if you hit and deal damage, your ally automatically succeeds at the flat check to remove the confused condition when taking damage.

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
