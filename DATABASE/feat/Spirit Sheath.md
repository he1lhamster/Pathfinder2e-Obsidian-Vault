You've magically constructed an extradimensional sheath for your weapon that you access through your clothing, typically through a pocket, sleeve, or seam. This sheath is hard to notice, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to your [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Item]] within it. A spirit sheath can hold only one weapon at a time, and the weapon must be 1 Bulk or less.
During a [[DATABASE/action/Spellstrike|Spellstrike]], you can Interact to draw the weapon before you Cast the Spell. You can draw or return a weapon in a spirit sheath as an Interact action, as can anyone else holding or wearing the clothing that contains the sheath. A [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] spell or similar effect can be used against the spirit sheath to expel the weapon. The counteract check is made against your spell DC and uses the sheath's counteract level of 1. The weapon is also expelled if you become [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]].
