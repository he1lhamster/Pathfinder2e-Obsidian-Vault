Your ancestral feud with humans gives you experience dealing with vicious foes, and your vengeance knows no bounds. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]], Perception, and [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] checks against [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|humans]], as well as on damage rolls against humans with weapons and unarmed attacks. However, your hatred of humans is immediately obvious, giving you a –2 circumstance penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks against them and usually starting their attitude one step worse towards you.
