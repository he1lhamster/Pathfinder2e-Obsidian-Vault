Your ancestral feud with humans gives you experience dealing with vicious foes, and your vengeance knows no bounds. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Intimidation]], Perception, and [[Survival]] checks against [[Human]], as well as on damage rolls against humans with weapons and unarmed attacks. However, your hatred of humans is immediately obvious, giving you a –2 circumstance penalty to [[Diplomacy]] checks against them and usually starting their attitude one step worse towards you.

## Traits

**Strix:**

Winged humanoids, most of whom live in and around Cheliax.
