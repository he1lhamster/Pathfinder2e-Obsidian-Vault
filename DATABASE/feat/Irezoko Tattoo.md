Your face bears an intricate magical tattoo known as the _irezoko_, a badge of your understanding of your chosen field of magic and a recognition of your advancement within Absalom's College of Mysteries. Choose a class that you are a member of that grants you access to a focus pool. When you take this feat, it gains the trait that applies to your chosen class. Once per day, you may concentrate upon the pattern of your _irezoko_ to recover 1 Focus Point as a three-action activity.
