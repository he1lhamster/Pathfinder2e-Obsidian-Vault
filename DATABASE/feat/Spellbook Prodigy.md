You are particularly adept at learning spells to add to your spellbook. You can [[DATABASE/action/Learn a Spell|Learn a Spell]] in half the time it normally takes. Further, when you roll a critical failure on your check to Learn a Spell, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure, you can try again after 1 week.
