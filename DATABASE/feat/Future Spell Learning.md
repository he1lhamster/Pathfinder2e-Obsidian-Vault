More future memories of time magic percolate back to the present, teaching you spells you've yet to learn. Add [[Behold the Weave]], [[Cast into Time]], [[Haste]], [[Loose Time's Arrow]], [[Quicken Time]], [[Slow]], and [[Stagnate Time]] to your spell list. You can thus potentially learn these spells even if they aren't normally on your tradition's spell list.
