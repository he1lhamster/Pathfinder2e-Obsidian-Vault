While all elves are immune to the paralyzing touch of [[Ghoul]], you can shake off flesh-numbing magic of all kinds. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against effects that would impose the [[Immobilized]], [[Paralyzed]], or [[Slowed]] conditions. When you would be immobilized, paralyzed, or slowed for at least 2 rounds, reduce that duration by 1 round.
