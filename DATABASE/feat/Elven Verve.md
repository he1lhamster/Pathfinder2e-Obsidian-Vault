While all elves are immune to the paralyzing touch of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghoul|ghouls]], you can shake off flesh-numbing magic of all kinds. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against effects that would impose the [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed]] conditions. When you would be immobilized, paralyzed, or slowed for at least 2 rounds, reduce that duration by 1 round.
