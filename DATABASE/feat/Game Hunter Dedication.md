**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 175. Broken Tusk Moon|Pathfinder #175: Broken Tusk Moon]]

**Prerequisites** trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]]

---
You are skilled at tracking big game animals and similar creatures. You gain the [[DATABASE/action/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] action, but you can designate only animals, beasts, and dragons as prey. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks against your hunted prey.
 When you succeed at a Strike against your hunted prey while it's [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], it must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC. On a failure, the prey's Speeds are each reduced by 10 feet for 1 round; on a critical failure, the duration of this effect is 1 minute. The prey is then temporarily immune to this effect for 10 minutes.
 If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]]. You apply the Stealth bonus and the Speed reduction only when your prey is an animal, beast, or dragon.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the game hunter archetype.
