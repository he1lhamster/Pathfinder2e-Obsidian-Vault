You’ve learned that it pays for a Pathfinder to be able to cast spells without being noticed. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Conceal Spell|Conceal Spell]] wizard class feat, though it’s not a wizard feat for you. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to Conceal a Spell and to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to conceal verbal components.
