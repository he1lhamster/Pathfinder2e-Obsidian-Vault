# Bone Caller <span class="item-type">Feat 9</span>

<span class="item-trait">Lizardfolk</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Ancestry Guide|Ancestry Guide]]

---
Using a mixture of dinosaur bones and the bones of your ancestors to focus your magic, you animate lizards and dinosaurs to carry messages or serve as mounts. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Animal Messenger|animal messenger]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Phantom Steed|phantom steed]] as primal innate spells once per day each. The animal messenger is always a Tiny dinosaur or lizard, and your innate spell transforms it from bones to flesh, even if there are no dinosaurs or lizards nearby. The _phantom steed_ looks like a dinosaur rather than a horse but functions identically.

## Traits

**Lizardfolk:**

These reptilian humanoids, also known as iruxi, are extremely adaptable and patient.
