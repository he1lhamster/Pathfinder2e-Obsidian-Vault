Your ability to sense undead has improved. You sense undead as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet: an uncomfortable sensation brushes against your spirit and stinks of rot. When in proximity to an undead, you can sense its presence, but it has the [[Hidden]] condition instead of the [[Observed]] condition. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a [[Deception]] or [[Stealth]] check against your Perception DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds, it's [[Undetected]], and you have to use the [[Seek]] basic action to detect the creature. As with hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to Seek to locate an undetected creature.
