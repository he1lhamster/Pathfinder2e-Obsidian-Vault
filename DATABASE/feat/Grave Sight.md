Your ability to sense undead has improved. You sense undead as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet: an uncomfortable sensation brushes against your spirit and stinks of rot. When in proximity to an undead, you can sense its presence, but it has the [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] condition instead of the [[DATABASE/condition/Observed|observed]] condition. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check against your Perception DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds, it's [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]], and you have to use the [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] basic action to detect the creature. As with hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to Seek to locate an undetected creature.
