**Trigger** You would take sonic damage from a spell.

---
You can manipulate the acoustics around you to deflect sonic damage back at its source. Attempt a [[Performance]] check against the spell DC of the creature that cast the triggering spell.
**Critical Success** You reduce the triggering damage by an amount up to four times your level. The caster takes sonic damage equal to the amount of damage you reduced in this way.
**Success** As critical success, but you reduce the triggering damage by an amount up to twice your level.
**Critical Failure** You misdirect the sonic waves at yourself, taking twice the triggering damage.
