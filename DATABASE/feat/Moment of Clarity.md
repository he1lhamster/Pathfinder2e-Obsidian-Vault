You push back your rage for a moment in order to think clearly. Until the end of this turn, you can use actions with the concentrate trait even if those actions don’t have the rage trait.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
