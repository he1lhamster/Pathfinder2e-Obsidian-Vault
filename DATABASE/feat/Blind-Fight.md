Your battle instincts make you more aware of [[Concealed]] and [[Invisible]] opponents. You don't need to succeed at a flat check to target concealed creatures. You're not [[Flat-Footed]] to creatures that are [[Hidden]] from you (unless you're flat-footed to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature.
 While you're adjacent to an [[Undetected]] creature of your level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
