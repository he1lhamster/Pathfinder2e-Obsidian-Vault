---
Your battle instincts make you more aware of [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] opponents. You don't need to succeed at a flat check to target concealed creatures. You're not [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to creatures that are [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from you (unless you're flat-footed to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature.
 While you're adjacent to an [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] creature of your level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
