**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Frequency** once per minute
**Trigger** You're about to attempt a saving throw against a mental effect.

---
You feel a strong connection with your progenitor and can convince yourself an effect targeting your mind was meant for theirs instead, allowing you to shrug off harmful effects. Roll the saving throw twice, and take the higher result. However, subsuming your identity is disturbing, and you're [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]].

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Reflection:**

A creature with this trait has the [[DATABASE/ancestry/Reflection|reflection]] versatile heritage. Reflections are beings who are copies of living people, whether through cloning, planar duplication, or another mechanism. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by reflections.
