Your fingernails grow into razor-sharp claws, and scales speckle your fingers, hands, and wrists. Your claws are agile, finesse unarmed attacks that deal 1d6 slashing damage and are in the [[Brawling]] weapon group.
 If you're a draconic sorcerer, when you cast [[Dragon Claws]], increase the spell's slashing damage die from d4 to d6 and increase the resistance to 10 at 1st level, 15 at 5th level, and 20 at 9th level.
