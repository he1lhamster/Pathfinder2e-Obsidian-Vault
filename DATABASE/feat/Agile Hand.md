**Source** [[Grand Bazaar]]

---
When you cast _mage hand_, you can modify its target to be a set of [[Thieves' Tools]]. When you Cast the Spell in this way, the tools move up to 20 feet towards a device or lock. After you Sustain the Spell on future turns, you can use the tools to attempt [[Thievery]] checks to [[Disable a Device]] or [[Pick a Lock]] within the spell's range, but you take a –2 penalty to your Thievery check. If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.
