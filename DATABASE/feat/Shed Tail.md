---
You can shed your tail to escape. You cease being grabbed, then Stride without triggering any reactions from the creature that grabbed you. It takes 1 week for your tail to fully grow back. Until it does, you can’t use your tail unarmed attack, and you take a –2 circumstance penalty on checks to Balance.
