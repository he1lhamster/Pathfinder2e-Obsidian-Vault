You are a paragon of all that is good, your overwhelming aura causing evildoers to cower. All evil creatures within 15 feet of you take a –1 status penalty to checks and DCs that target you or your allies. This penalty is –2 against creatures you have taken an oath against (such as dragons if you have the [[Dragonslayer Oath]] feat). You can choose to suppress or resume this aura as an action, which has the concentrate trait.

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
