Your body is as supple as a sapling, capable of bending without breaking. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]], and if you roll a success to [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

## Traits
