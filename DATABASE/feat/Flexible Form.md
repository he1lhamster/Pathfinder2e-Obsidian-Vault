Your body is as supple as a sapling, capable of bending without breaking. You become trained in [[Acrobatics]], and if you roll a success to [[Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

## Traits

Ghorans are sapient plants grown in the shape of humanoids with floral faces.
