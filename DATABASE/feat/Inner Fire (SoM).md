While you're in Stoked Flame Stance, you have cold and fire resistance equal to half your level, and any creature that hits you with an unarmed attack, tries to [[Grab]] or [[Grapple]] you, or otherwise touches you takes fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.
