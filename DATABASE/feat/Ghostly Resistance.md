Your ghostly form becomes innately weaker but also gains resistance to many forms of damage. Your maximum HP is reduced by your level. You gain resistance 1 to all damage except for force, positive, and any damage done by a weapon with the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] rune (or any other source that acts like a _ghost touch_ rune). This resistance increases to 2 if the source is non-magical.
 At 10th level, the resistance increases to 2, or 4 if the source is non-magical. At 16th level, the resistance increases to 3, or 5 if the source is non-magical.
