You have refined your palate and have a discerning sense of taste that can detect abnormalities in the flavor and texture of food and beverages. When eating food or drinking a beverage, you automatically attempt to identify the ingredients, which might alert you to the presence of alterations or additives, such as poisons. The GM rolls a secret Perception check using the poison's level to determine the DC; on a success, you learn that the food or drink was poisoned, but not the specific poison used. 
If you lick or taste something while [[DATABASE/action/Investigate|Investigating]] or attempting to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] to identify something, if the taste would provide relevant additional information (at the GM's discretion), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.
