You can connect with oozes (and other amorphous aberrations, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on oozes and to make very simple [[DATABASE/action/Request|Requests]] of them. In most instances, oozes will give you time to make your case.
