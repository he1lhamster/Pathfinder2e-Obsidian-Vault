---
You lower yourself to the ground and take an imposing, knuckle-walking stance. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are gorilla slam unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] group; and have the backswing, forceful, grapple, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. While you are in Gorilla Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], and if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.

## Traits

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
