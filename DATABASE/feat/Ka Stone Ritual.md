# Ka Stone Ritual <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Living Monolith]]**Prerequisites** [[Living Monolith Dedication]]; a [[Sphinx]] or living monolith with this feat performs a ritual with you

---
You inscribe your true name on your _ka stone_, as well as oaths to gods and pharaohs, and embed it in your forehead in a special ritual with a sphinx or with a living monolith who already has this feat. The _ka stone_ is an invested magic item that you automatically invest each day. It can’t be removed without your permission, nor can it be dispelled, and you can never lose investiture in the ka stone. Its Bulk is negligible.
 The ka stone grants you a +1 item bonus to saves against death effects and negative effects, which increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (envision), or a different activation if otherwise specified **Frequency** a number of times each day equal to the number of class feats you have from the Living Monolith archetype; **Effect** You cast [[Enlarge]] on yourself or use one of the other activated abilities granted by a later Living Monolith feat.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
