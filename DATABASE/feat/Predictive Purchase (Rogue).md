You somehow manage to have just the thing for the situation. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Prescient Planner|Prescient Planner]] and [[DATABASE/feat/Prescient Consumable|Prescient Consumable]] feats. When using Prescient Planner, you can draw the item from your [[DATABASE/equipment/Backpack|backpack]] (or a similar container) as a 2-action activity, instead of taking 1 minute to do so.
