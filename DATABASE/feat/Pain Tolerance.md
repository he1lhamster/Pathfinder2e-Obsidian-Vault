## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

### Black Powder Feats

**Source** [[Pathfinder 178. Punks in a Powderkeg]]
If the characters agree to Nixbrix's challenge to defeat Bitey or otherwise impress the gang leader, he offers to teach them a few tricks. The characters gain access to the feats in the Black-Powder Berserkers section on page 79, even if they aren't from Alkenstar or the Mana Wastes, though they still must meet the feats' other prerequisites to take them.
**Related Feats**: [[Black Powder Flash]], [[Inured to Alchemy]], [[Powder Punch Stance]], [[Thunder Clap]]
