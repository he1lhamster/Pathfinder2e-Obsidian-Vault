# Counter Element <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Impulse</span><span class="item-trait">Kineticist</span>
**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Prerequisites** exactly one kinetic element
**Trigger** You're targeted by or in the area of an effect that has the trait matching your kinetic element and originates from an enemy or hazard.

---
Your absolute dedication to a single element lets you attempt to gain control over it, even when the element is in service to another entity. You attempt to counteract the effect, using your kineticist class DC – 10 as your counteract check modifier and half this impulse's level rounded up as the counteract rank. If you counteract the effect, you protect only yourself unless you got a critical success on your counteract check.

---
**Level (12th)** If you successfully counteract the effect, you can have it target or affect a different creature within 30 feet of you. If you got a critical success on the counteract check, you can choose the effect's targets or entire area.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.
