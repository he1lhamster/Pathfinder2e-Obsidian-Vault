You can summon the full magic of Bhopan's grand dance. Stride up to your Speed; during this Stride, you can walk on air as if it were solid ground. You can ascend and descend in this way at a maximum of a 45-degree angle. You must end your Stride on a surface that can support you or you fall.

## Traits

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
