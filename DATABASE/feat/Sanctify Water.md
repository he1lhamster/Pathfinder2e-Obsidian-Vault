You imbue water with your deity’s blessing. Choose a container of water on your person that is of light Bulk. For 1 round, if you or an ally throw this container at a foe, it has the damaging effects of [[DATABASE/equipment/Holy Water|holy water]] (if you follow a good deity) or [[DATABASE/equipment/Unholy Water|unholy water]] (if you follow an evil deity). The water’s transient power doesn’t make it gain any value, allow it to be used to supply the cost for a spell or ritual, and so on. If you have legendary proficiency in [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]], you can sanctify three containers held by you or allies within your reach instead of one.
