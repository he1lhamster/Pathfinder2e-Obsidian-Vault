PFS Note

---
You have been exposed to powerful fey magic. You become trained in primal DCs and spell attack rolls. You gain the fey trait and one of the following features that grants an innate primal spell that can be used once per day.

* **Anteater** You can launch your tongue forward as a deadly attack, gaining [[Grim Tendrils]].
* **[[Cat Sith]]** You have catlike features and can appear as a mundane cat with [[Pest Form]] (cat only).
* **Cursed Bluebird** You have blue feathers or wings. It's terrible luck to harm a bluebird, and you can manifest that power as [[Ill Omen]].
* **[[Dryad]]** Your body is covered in elegant vines, granting you [[Summon Plant or Fungus]].
* **Faun** Your legs and feet are swift and possibly hooved, granting you [[Fleet Step]].
* **[[Gremlin]]** You have long, bat-like ears and gain [[Bane]].
* **Monarch** You have vestigial, insectile features and gain [[Spider Sting]].
* **[[Unicorn]]** You have a magical horn or a prominent symbol of one on your forehead, which you can use to cast [[Heal]].

**Special** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for [[Human]], goblin for [[Goblin]], etc.).

## Fey Influence Leads To...

[[Cannibalize Magic]], [[Drain Emotion]], [[Eldritch Calm]], [[Fey Ascension]], [[Fey Transcendence]], [[Glamour]]

## Traits

**All Ancestries:**

A feat with this trait is available to all ancestries.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
