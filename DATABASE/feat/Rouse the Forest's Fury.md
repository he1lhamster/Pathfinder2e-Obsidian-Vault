Terrifying trees attack your enemies. Three Large trees appear in unoccupied spaces within 500 feet, at least 15 feet from one another. Each tree has AC 40, Fortitude +33, Reflex +24, Will +30, and 200 HP. The trees can flank, but are unable to move. When the trees appear, each makes a Strike; they share a multiple attack penalty. The tree's melee Strike is a branch that has reach 10 feet; on a hit, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] by the tree ([[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC 40). The ranged Strike is a hurled fruit, gourd, seed, or stone with a range increment of 60 feet. Either Strike has a +30 attack modifier and deals 4d10+9 bludgeoning damage.
 The trees last until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse. Each time you Sustain the impulse, you can have one tree make a Strike.

**Level (20th)** The attack modifier is +32 and the Strike damage is 5d10+9.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Plant:**

Vegetable creatures have the plant trait. They are distinct from normal plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Wood:**

Effects with the wood trait conjure or manipulate wood. Those that manipulate wood have no effect in an area without wood. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of wood or have a connection to magical wood.
