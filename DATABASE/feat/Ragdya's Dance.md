# Ragdya's Dance <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 9</span>

<span class="item-trait">Vanara</span>
**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Frequency** once per hour
**Trigger** An adjacent [[Observed]] creature succeeds at an attack roll against you.

---
Even when faced with deadly danger, you fight with the rapturous laughter of [[Ragdya]] in your heart and can play impossible tricks. After resolving the successful attack, the triggering creature must attempt a Will save against the higher of your class DC or your spell DC. On a failure, you and the triggering creature switch places. You and the triggering creature must each be able to fit in the new space, and your positions must be unoccupied.
