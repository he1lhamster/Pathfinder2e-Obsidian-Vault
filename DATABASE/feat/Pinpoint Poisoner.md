Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your poisons. When you successfully Strike a [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] creature with a poisoned weapon or expose a flat-footed creature to an inhaled poison, the flat-footed condition also gives that creature a –2 circumstance penalty to its initial save against that poison.
