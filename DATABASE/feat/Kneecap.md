---
You deliver a punishing blow to an enemy's knee, shin, or other vulnerable anatomy within your reach. Make a Strike with one of your melee weapons or melee unarmed attacks. This attack doesn't deal damage. On a hit, the target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed or a –15-foot status penalty on a critical hit. The penalty lasts for 1 round. This penalty applies only if the target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed, this can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet.
