Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] instead of [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] a typical worshipper of another faith or to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]] specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
