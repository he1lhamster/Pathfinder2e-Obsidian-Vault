You trample your foes as you charge past them. When you use Barreling Charge and successfully move through a creature's space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier. If you critically succeed, the creature takes twice this amount of damage and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the end of your next turn.
