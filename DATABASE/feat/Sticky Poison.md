# Sticky Poison <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Alchemist</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Poisoner|Poisoner]]*
* This archetype offers Sticky Poison at a different level than displayed here.

---
A combination of additional viscosity and careful application keeps your weapons poisoned even when suffering significant wear and tear. If your Strike with a poisoned weapon would expend its poison without your target attempting an initial save (due to resistance or your Strike being a critical failure, for example), attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned. If your Strike with a poisoned weapon succeeds, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn.
