---
You are plagued by sporadic anatomical rearrangements, which grant you insights into other creatures with unusual anatomies. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] and Ooze Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves to avoid being [[DATABASE/monsterability/Engulf|Engulfed]] by creatures, and to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] after being Engulfed.
 As you develop more abilities based on your amorphous affliction, you become increasingly off-putting to mundane creatures. You take a penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks against animals and humanoids. This penalty is equal to your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype, to a maximum of –4 for four or more feats.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the oozemorph archetype.
