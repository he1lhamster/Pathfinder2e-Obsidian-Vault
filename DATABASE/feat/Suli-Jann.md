Your elemental ancestor was a [[DATABASE/monster/Janni|janni]], genies that walk the mortal world and embody all four elements together. You inherited a janni's nature as a wanderer and ability to survive in many types of environment, from the hottest desert to the coldest tundra. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]]. If you would automatically become trained in Survival (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Forager|Forager]] skill feat as a bonus feat.
