You strategically craft your debilitations to lessen or negate an enemy's tactical advantages. Add the following debilitations to the list you can choose from when you use Debilitating Strike.

* **Debilitation** The target can't flank other creatures, and it can't provide flanking for its allies.
* **Debilitation** The target doesn't gain a circumstance bonus to AC from [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raising a Shield]], lesser cover, or standard cover; it gains only a +2 circumstance bonus to AC from greater cover or Taking Cover.
