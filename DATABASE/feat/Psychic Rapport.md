Your telepathic sensitivity intensifies when you're affected by mental magic, making it easier for you to link to other creatures. After you Cast a Spell with the mental trait, until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Deception]], [[Diplomacy]], and [[Intimidation]] checks, and to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive]].
