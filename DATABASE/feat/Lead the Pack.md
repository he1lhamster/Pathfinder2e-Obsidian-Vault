<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetypes** [[Beastmaster]], [[Undead Master]]
**Prerequisites** [[Mature Beastmaster Companion]]; you have multiple animal companions

---
You can have up to two animal companions active at once. However, when you do, it's slightly more difficult to [[Command an Animal]] them. If you don't Command either of your companions, one of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike, as per [[Mature Beastmaster Companion]], but not both. When you Command an Animal, either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to Stride or Strike. Either way, you can't Command an Animal to make either companion act again until your next turn.
