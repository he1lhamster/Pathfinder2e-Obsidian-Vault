You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence. Make a Strike against your target. That creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target remains flat-footed for the rest of your turn and is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]] (frightened 2 on a critical hit).
