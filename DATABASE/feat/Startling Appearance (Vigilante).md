[[Frightening Appearance]], [[Stunning Appearance]]

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Emotion:**

This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.

**Fear:**

Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Vigilante:**

Using actions and abilities with the vigilante trait while in your social identity risks exposing you as a [[Vigilante]].
