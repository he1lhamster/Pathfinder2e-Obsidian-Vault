The restorative power of your healing invigorates the recipient. If the next action you use is to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] targeting a single living creature and the target regains Hit Points from the spell, it also gains three bonuses until the end of its next turn: a +5-foot status bonus to its Speed, a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, and a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
