---
You've learned Devrin Arlos's guileful ways, and his sly teachings help you remind your allies to keep their wits about them. When you use this action, attempt a Deception check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.
**Critical Success** Your marshal's aura increases to a 20-foot emanation, and it grants you and your allies a +1 status bonus to skill checks. When you or an ally in the aura Strike a [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] enemy, that enemy can't use reactions until the beginning of its next turn.
**Success** As critical success, but your aura's size doesn't increase.
**Failure** You fail to enter the stance.
**Critical Failure** You fail to enter the stance and can't take this action again for 1 minute.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Open:**

These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an open only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
