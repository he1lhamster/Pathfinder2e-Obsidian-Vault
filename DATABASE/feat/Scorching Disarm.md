You make a weapon unbearable to hold. Attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] a target creature. You don't need to have a hand free to make this Disarm attempt. If the Disarm attempt succeeds, the target takes 4d6 fire damage unless it drops the weapon, and on a critical success, it takes 4d6 fire damage and drops the weapon. If you're legendary in Athletics, this increases to 8d6 fire damage.

## Traits

**Fire:**

Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

**Ifrit:**

Ifrits are planar scions descended from [[DATABASE/monster/Efreeti|efreet]].
