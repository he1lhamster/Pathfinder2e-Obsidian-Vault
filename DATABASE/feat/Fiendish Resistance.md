Your connection to your fiendish forebears has granted you one of their resistances as well. Choose one of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.
 Though you can choose any of these, the damage type typically matches a fiend associated with your bloodline. For instance, a hellspawn might choose resistance to fire, or a pitborn with a [[DATABASE/monster/Vrock (Wrath Demon)|vrock]] ancestor might choose resistance to electricity.
