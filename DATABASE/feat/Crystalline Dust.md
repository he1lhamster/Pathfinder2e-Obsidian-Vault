You've learned to disperse the crystalline motes coating your body as a haze. You become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], though you can't use this concealment to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] or [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]], as normal for concealment where your position is still obvious. The motes stay within an inch of your skin, move with you, and last for a number of rounds equal to half your level.
