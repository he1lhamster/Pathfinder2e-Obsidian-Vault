You've learned to disperse the crystalline motes coating your body as a haze. You become [[Concealed]], though you can't use this concealment to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]], as normal for concealment where your position is still obvious. The motes stay within an inch of your skin, move with you, and last for a number of rounds equal to half your level.
