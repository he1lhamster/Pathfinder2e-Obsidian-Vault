Your work as an investigator makes you familiar with the criminal element. You might be a criminal yourself, or you might have gained an understanding of how they operate from the outside. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Underworld Lore]], and you gain your [[DATABASE/action/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]] circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] checks to investigate the subject of your lead (such as checks to [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]] a clue from a suspect or [[DATABASE/action/Pick a Lock|Pick a Lock]] to open a safe with damning documents).
