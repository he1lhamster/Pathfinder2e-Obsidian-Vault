You carefully take aim before making your attack in order to avoid your foe's concealment and cover. On your next Strike with a thrown weapon before the end of your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll and ignore your target's [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] condition, as well as the target's lesser cover or standard cover; if the target had greater cover, they instead have only standard cover against the Strike.
