When you enter your Arcane Cascade, you disperse the magical reinforcement to nearby allies. You grant the extra damage of Arcane Cascade in an aura affecting all allies in a 5-foot emanation. This uses only the base damage of the stance, based on the ally's weapon specialization; it doesn't use any increase you get from bonuses, the [[DATABASE/magushybridstudy/Inexorable Iron|laughing shadow]] hybrid study, or the like. As normal for duplicate effects, multiple Arcane Cascades affecting the same creature aren't cumulative.
