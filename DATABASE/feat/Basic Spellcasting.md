You increase your ability to cast spells. You gain the basic spellcasting benefits granted by spellcasting archetypes, gaining a spell repertoire. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the basic, expert, and master spellcasting benefits from pervasive magic feats, add a spell of the appropriate spell level to your repertoire: a common spell of the magical tradition matching your trait, or another spell of that tradition that you have learned or discovered.

## Traits

**Pervasive Magic:**

_Note from Nethys: no description was provided for this trait. See here for details_

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
