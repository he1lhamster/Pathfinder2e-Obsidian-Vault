When you observe an ally try and fail to execute a strategic maneuver against your enemies, you coordinate with your other allies to finish the job, using the opening from the first attempt to keep your foe off-balance and ensure your eventual success.
 When an ally within your overwatch field attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]], [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]], or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] an opponent within your overwatch field and fails, you coordinate efforts to provide a +2 circumstance bonus to the next [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check rolled by a different ally to attempt the same action on the same target before that target's next turn.
