You’ve trained your animal companion to blend in to its surroundings. Your animal companion gains the benefit of the [[DATABASE/feat/Camouflage|Camouflage]] feat. If your companion is a specialized ambusher, its proficiency rank for Stealth increases to master (or legendary if it was already master).
