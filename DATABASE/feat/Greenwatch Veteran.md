**Trigger** Your turn starts, and you're in combat against a creature you spent at least 10 minutes [[DATABASE/action/Track|Tracking]].

---
Your time spent tracking your target allows you to quickly identify its weaknesses and relay them to your allies. Attempt a [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check against the creature you were Tracking. On a success, you always know the creature's greatest weakness and highest resistance or immunity, in addition to any other information the check would typically provide. You immediately use a quick series of hand gestures to signal this information to any allies who can see you.

## Traits

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
