You call upon the power of the elements, infusing your ki with elemental energy and allowing your attacks to deal energy damage. When you cast [[DATABASE/spell/Ki Strike|ki strike]], in addition to the damage types normally available, you can deliver the extra damage in the form of a gust of storm-tossed wind (dealing electricity damage and gaining the air trait), a chunk of stone (dealing bludgeoning damage and gaining the earth trait), a flickering flame (dealing fire damage), or a crashing wave of frigid water (dealing cold damage and gaining the water trait).
