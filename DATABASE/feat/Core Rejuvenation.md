<span class="item-trait">Automaton</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
**Frequency** once per day
**Trigger** You have the [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]] condition and are about to attempt a recovery check.

---
Your soul taps into your core's power to push against the grasp of death and allow you to recover consciousness. You're restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the dying and [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the [[DATABASE/condition/Wounded|wounded]] condition as normal when losing the dying condition in this way.
**Enhancement** Your soul can draw even more power from your core, granting you additional benefits. When you use Core Rejuvenation, you also gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to three times your level. These Hit Points remain for 1 minute.
