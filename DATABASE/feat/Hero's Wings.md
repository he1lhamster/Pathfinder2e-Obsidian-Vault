You have begun the final steps to reaching your full potential. Your wings are always in their majestic form without you needing to use Energize Wings, granting you a permanent fly Speed. Furthermore, sprites recognize you as a powerful hero (or villain) by your unique wings and are appropriately impressed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks against sprites and gain the benefits of the [[DATABASE/feat/Glad-Hand|Glad-Hand]] skill feat against other sprites, without taking a –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check.

## Traits

**Sprite:**

A family of diminutive winged fey with a strong connection to primal magic.
