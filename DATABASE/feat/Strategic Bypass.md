Your plans account for your foes' resistances, enabling you to strike a telling blow. When you hit with a Strike on which you substituted your attack roll due to [[DATABASE/action/Devise a Stratagem|Devising a Stratagem]], you ignore an amount of resistance equal to your Intelligence modifier for each resistance that applies against your attack.
