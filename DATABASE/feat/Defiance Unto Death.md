---
You loathe the [[Alghollthu]] and their mind magic, and you’ve been trained to be willing to die rather than give into mental manipulation. If you would start your turn [[Confused]], [[Controlled]], or [[Fleeing]] due to a failed Will save, you can attempt a Will save against the same DC; on a success, you become [[Paralyzed]] until your next turn, rather than act against your will.

## Traits

**Elf:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the elf ancestry. Elves are mysterious people with rich traditions of magic and scholarship who typically have [[Low-Light Vision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by elves. A weapon with this trait is created and used by elves.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
