You loathe the [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Alghollthu|alghollthus]] and their mind magic, and you’ve been trained to be willing to die rather than give into mental manipulation. If you would start your turn [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]], [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] due to a failed Will save, you can attempt a Will save against the same DC; on a success, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] until your next turn, rather than act against your will.
