You've learned to harness the supernatural curse that animates you, imbuing your most powerful attacks with a terrible curse. When you critically hit with a fist Strike, negative energy binds to it; this is a curse and a disease. The creature takes 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent negative damage]]. While the creature has this persistent damage, it's also [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]]. The persistent damage increases to 3d6 at 14th level and 4d6 at 20th level. This is a critical specialization effect.
