You bring discipline to your mind and magic, ensuring that you don't under-perform. Until the end of your turn, instead of rolling dice for damage, count each damage die as average damage rounded up (3 for d4, 4 for d6, 5 for d8, 6 for d10, and 7 for d12).

## Traits

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Psyche:**

Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.
