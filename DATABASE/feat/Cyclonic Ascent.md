Whorls of wind surround your lower body, forming a cyclone that lifts you into the air. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed or 30 feet, whichever is greater, for 10 minutes. Unlike with a normal fly Speed, you can move upward without treating it as difficult terrain. In addition, you can remain in the air at the end of your turn if you used an air impulse during that turn, even if you didn't use a Fly action that turn.

**Level (14th)** You can target up to five additional creatures, each of which gains a fly Speed equal to its land Speed or 30 feet, whichever is greater. They don't gain the other benefits.

## Traits

**Air:**

Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air with various degrees of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
