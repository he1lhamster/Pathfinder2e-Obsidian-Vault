Your powerful ego makes it harder for others to order you around. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a mental effect that attempts to directly control your actions, you critically succeed instead. If a creature rolls a failure on a check to [[Coerce]] you using [[Intimidation]], it gets a critical failure instead (so it can't try to Coerce you again for 1 week).
