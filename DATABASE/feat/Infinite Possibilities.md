You’ve found a way to prepare a spell slot that exists in your mind as many different possibilities at once. Once during your daily preparations, you can use a spell slot to hold that infinite potential, rather than using it to prepare a spell. You can use this spell slot to cast any spell from your spellbook that’s at least 2 levels lower than the slot you designate; the spell acts in all ways as a spell of 2 levels lower. You don’t have any particular spell prepared in that slot until you cast it.
