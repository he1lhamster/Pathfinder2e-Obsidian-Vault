Using your ancestors' bones, you manifest their spirits around you in a fossilized form, terrifying your foes. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Mask of Terror|mask of terror]] on yourself as a primal innate spell once per day. When you do, you appear as a skeletal lizardfolk ancestor, twisted in a way that inspires the deepest fears of those who observe you.
