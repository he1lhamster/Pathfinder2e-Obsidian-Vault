**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]]

---
Using your ancestors' bones, you manifest their spirits around you in a fossilized form, terrifying your foes. You can cast [[Mask of Terror]] on yourself as a primal innate spell once per day. When you do, you appear as a skeletal lizardfolk ancestor, twisted in a way that inspires the deepest fears of those who observe you.

## Traits

**Lizardfolk:**

These reptilian humanoids, also known as iruxi, are extremely adaptable and patient.
