Wings free you from the shackles of the ground below. Add the bat and bird forms in [[DATABASE/spell/Aerial Form|aerial form]] to your [[DATABASE/spell/Wild Shape|wild shape]] list. If you have [[DATABASE/feat/Insect Shape|Insect Shape]], you also add the wasp form to your _wild shape_ list. If you have [[DATABASE/feat/Ferocious Shape|Ferocious Shape]], you also add the pterosaur form to your _wild shape_ list. Whenever you use _wild shape_ to gain a form that grants you a specific [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] modifier, you gain a +1 status bonus to Acrobatics checks.
