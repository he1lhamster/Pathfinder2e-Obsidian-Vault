Wings free you from the shackles of the ground below. Add the bat and bird forms in [[Aerial Form]] to your [[Wild Shape]] list. If you have [[Insect Shape]], you also add the wasp form to your _wild shape_ list. If you have [[Ferocious Shape]], you also add the pterosaur form to your _wild shape_ list. Whenever you use _wild shape_ to gain a form that grants you a specific [[Acrobatics]] modifier, you gain a +1 status bonus to Acrobatics checks.
