You vent a jet of supercooled fluid from your innovation, damaging a foe and slowing it down. Target one creature within 60 feet. That creature takes cold damage equal to your level, with effects depending on its Reflex save.
 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage and takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
**Failure** The target takes full damage and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round, and takes a –15-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. 
**Unstable Function** Your innovation discharges an enormous cone of supercooled fluid, potentially causing cascading failures. Add the unstable trait to Deep Freeze. The ability affects all creatures within a 60-foot cone instead of a single target, and it deals cold damage equal to double your level instead of equal to your level.
 If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot or 90-foot cone when you use an unstable Deep Freeze.
**Special** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.

## Traits

**Cold:**

Effects with this trait deal cold damage. Creatures with this trait have a connection to magical cold.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.
