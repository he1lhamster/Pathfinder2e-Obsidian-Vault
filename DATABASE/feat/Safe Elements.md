Elements are wild and dangerous, but you've found ways to reduce their risk. When you [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]] or use a stance impulse that affects your kinetic aura, you can designate a number of creatures up to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 creature). Choose whether they are immune to the benefits of your kinetic aura or immune to its damage and drawbacks. You don't have to be able to see a creature to designate it, nor does it need to be in your kinetic aura, but you can't designate a creature that's [[DATABASE/condition/Unnoticed|unnoticed]] by you.
 In addition, you gain the Pacifying Infusion action.
 **Pacifying Infusion** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (infusion) If your next action is an impulse, it gains the nonlethal trait. If it has an area, you can exclude creatures you've designated with Safe Elements from its effects.
