Animals born and raised far from humanoid settlements rarely get along with two-legged beings, whom they assume to be dangerous predators. In spite of this, you know how to approach and entreat a wild animal so that it's more receptive to your presence and requests. 
To use this feat, choose a wild animal that isn't actively hostile to you and which isn't confined to an area smaller than its Speed in diameter (animals held in place or trapped are typically too scared to be tamed). Attempt a Nature check against a DC determined by the GM; this is usually the animal's Will DC, but circumstances might adjust the precise DC. This attempt usually takes an hour, but you can perform it in 10 minutes if you have expert proficiency in Nature, 1 minute if you have master proficiency, or as a three-action activity if you have legendary proficiency.
**Critical Success** You form a friendly bond with the animal. As long as it isn't starving, the animal won't attack you or creatures obviously allied with you, even if they're creatures the animal would normally prey upon. This effect is permanent.
**Success** As critical success, but the effect lasts for 1 month. If you or an ally teach the animal a basic action during that time with the [[DATABASE/feat/Train Animal|Train Animal]] skill feat, the effect is permanent.
**Failure** You fail to make any kind of meaningful impression on the animal.
**Critical Failure** The animal does its best to attack you and is immune to Tame Animal for 1 month.

## Traits

**Exploration:**

An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

### Skill Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 175. Broken Tusk Moon|Pathfinder #175: Broken Tusk Moon]]
Characters can gain access to the following new skill feats throughout “Broken Tusk Moon.”
 **All of the Animal**: Head scout Wipa teaches this skill feat to characters who help her butcher an animal for meat, such as the moose at the beginning of the adventure or another animal slain throughout the course of the Broken Tusk following's journey.
 **Spirit Speaker**: Mammoth Lord Argakoa, also known as Argakoa the Songsinger, might teach a fraction of her tremendous skill to a young scout who joins her in song. 
**Tame Animal**: The young herd tender Imek has a natural way with animals. She is happy to teach what she knows to any characters who display a similar reverence toward living creatures, such as by peacefully resolving their encounter with the giant porcupine in Chapter 1 of this adventure. Although this feat is particularly useful to characters who want to recruit animal followers throughout the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path, it isn't strictly necessary for the party to succeed in their adventures. It can be a great boon to parties taking part in other quests, as well.
