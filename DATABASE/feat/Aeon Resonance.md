# Aeon Resonance <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
**Archetype** [[Runelord]]
**Prerequisites** [[Embed Aeon Stone]]

---
You gain the resonant power of one embedded _[[Aeon Stone]]_ as if it were placed in a [[Wayfinder]]. While you can embed multiple _aeon stones_ in your flesh, you can gain the resonance power from only one embedded stone at a time, selected each day when you make your daily preparations.
**Special** At 8th level, you can take this feat again. If you do, you gain the resonance powers of up to four invested _aeon stones_ instead of only one.
