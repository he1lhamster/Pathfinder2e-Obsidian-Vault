You gain the resonant power of one embedded _[[DATABASE/equipment/Aeon Stone|aeon stone]]_ as if it were placed in a [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]]. While you can embed multiple _aeon stones_ in your flesh, you can gain the resonance power from only one embedded stone at a time, selected each day when you make your daily preparations.
**Special** At 8th level, you can take this feat again. If you do, you gain the resonance powers of up to four invested _aeon stones_ instead of only one.
