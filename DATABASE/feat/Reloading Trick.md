<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Manipulate</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 165. Eyes of Empty Death|Pathfinder #165: Eyes of Empty Death]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Drow Shootist|Drow Shootist]]
**Frequency** once per round
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Drow Shootist Dedication|Drow Shootist Dedication]]
**Requirements** You're holding an unloaded hand crossbow.

---
You can fire off a single shot even when unprepared. You Interact to reload your [[DATABASE/weapon/Hand Crossbow|hand crossbow]] and [[DATABASE/action/Strike|Strike]] with it.
**Special** If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Repeating Hand Crossbow Training|Repeating Hand Crossbow Training]] feat, you can use this feat with a [[DATABASE/weapon/Repeating Hand Crossbow|repeating hand crossbow]] to load either a bolt or a magazine, but the speed means you can fire only one bolt, then the magazine jams. You must spend a 3-action Interact activity to remove the jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.
