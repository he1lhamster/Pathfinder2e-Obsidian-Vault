Your kingdom's reputation has spread far and wide, bringing in visitors to behold the spectacle of your greatness and pay their respects. Whenever you achieve a critical success on any Kingdom skill check during the Activity phase of a Kingdom turn, gain 1 bonus Resource Die at the start of your next Kingdom turn.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
