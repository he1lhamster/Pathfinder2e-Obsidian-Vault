**Trigger** You use the [[Shield Block]] reaction, and the opponent that triggered Shield Block is adjacent to you and is your size or smaller.

---
You push back as you block the attack, knocking your foe away or off balance. You use your shield to push the triggering creature, either automatically [[Shove]] it 5 feet or causing it to become [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of your next turn. The triggering creature chooses whether to be moved or become flat-footed. If it chooses to be moved, you choose the direction. If the Shove would cause it to hit a solid object, enter a square of difficult terrain, or enter another creature's space, it must become flat-footed instead of being moved.
