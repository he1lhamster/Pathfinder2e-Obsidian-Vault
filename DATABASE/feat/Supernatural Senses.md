Your scent is preternaturally sharp, and you can always rely on your sense of smell to help guide you when your vision is compromised. When you target a [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] opponent while you are raging, you reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or to 9 for a hidden one.

## Traits

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
