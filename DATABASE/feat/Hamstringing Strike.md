You slow your foes with a well-aimed attack. Make a Strike against your hunted prey with a –2 penalty. If you hit your prey, the creature takes a –5-foot status penalty to Speed. If you critically hit your prey, the creature takes a –10-foot status penalty to Speed. A creature immune to bleed damage does not take this penalty. The penalty can be removed using any method that removes [[Persistent Damage]] or offers a flat check to do so, such as [[Administer First Aid]].

## Traits

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

### Adventuring with Ekundayo

**Source** [[Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
Ekundayo eventually develops his own methods to pursue his favored enemies—giants. Once he gains the Magical Crafting feat at 4th level, he begins to craft specialized ammunition and runes for weapons. As long as his attitude toward the PCs is at least friendly, he shares these discoveries with them, unlocking the following ranger class feats and items as soon as his level equals the level of the feat or item.
