Your elemental lineage manifests as magma and molten rock, and you can focus the magma into your hand to attack your foes. You gain a magma spike unarmed attack, which requires a free hand to use. This is an agile, finesse, unarmed attack in the [[Brawling]] weapon group that deals 1d4 piercing damage, as well as 1 additional fire damage. Instead of the normal critical specialization effect, the target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]]; you gain a bonus on this persistent damage equal to your item bonus to attack rolls on unarmed attacks.
