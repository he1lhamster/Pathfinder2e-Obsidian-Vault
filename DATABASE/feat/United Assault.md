---
Through countless battles, you've learned you're stronger when working alongside your allies. Make a Strike. Your Strike gains a circumstance bonus to damage rolls equal to the number of other different creatures that damaged the target since the end of the target's last turn, to a maximum of a +4 circumstance bonus.

## Traits

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
