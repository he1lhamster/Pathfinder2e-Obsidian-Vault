Imitating animal threat displays, you make yourself appear larger and more imposing. Roll one [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] and compare the result to the Will DC of each animal, fungus, and plant creature in a 15-foot cone. When you do, Demoralize gains the visual trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. You don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.
