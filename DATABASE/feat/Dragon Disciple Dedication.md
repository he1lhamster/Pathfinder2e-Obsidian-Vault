# Dragon Disciple Dedication <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Dragon Disciple|Dragon Disciple]]
**Access** You are a [[DATABASE/ancestry/Kobold|kobold]] with the [[DATABASE/heritage/Dragonscaled Kobold|dragonscaled]] or [[DATABASE/heritage/Spellscale Kobold|spellscaled]] heritage, a [[DATABASE/barbarianinstinct/Dragon Instinct|dragon instinct]] barbarian, or a [[DATABASE/sorcererbloodline/Draconic|draconic bloodline]] sorcerer.

You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your focus grants you a measure of its power. You become trained in arcane spell DCs and arcane spell attack rolls. Choose one color of dragon when you select this feat; if you are a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, this must be the same type as your bloodline. You gain resistance equal to half your level against one type of damage determined by the chosen dragon type. The GM may allow you to choose a dragon type not listed below, and will determine the damage type appropriate for that dragon.
