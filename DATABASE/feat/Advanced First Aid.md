You use your medical training to ameliorate sickness or assuage fears. When you use [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] to [[DATABASE/action/Administer First Aid|Administer First Aid]], instead of Stabilizing a character or Stopping Bleeding, you can reduce an ally's [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]] condition by 2, or remove either of those conditions entirely on a critical success. You can remove only one condition at a time. The DC for the Medicine check is usually the DC of the effect that caused the condition.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Healing:**

A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
