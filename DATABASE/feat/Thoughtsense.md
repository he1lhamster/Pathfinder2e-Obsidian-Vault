You can detect the flickers of mental activity let off by all thinking creatures. You gain thoughtsense as a vague sense that has a range of 30 feet—like all vague senses, it's only about as precise as an average human's sense of smell, meaning you generally can predict only if a creature is present. Your thoughtsense detects only thinking creatures, so a creature that is unthinking or otherwise immune to mental effects (such as many constructs and oozes) can't be perceived using your thoughtsense, regardless of how precise it is. 
While your [[DATABASE/action/Unleash Psyche|Psyche is Unleashed]], your thoughtsense upgrades to an imprecise sense, letting you use it to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] out creatures.

## Traits

**Divination:**

The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.
