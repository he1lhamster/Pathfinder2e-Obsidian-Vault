You forge a mystical connection with an ally using your body as a focus, allowing them to benefit from your magic. You place a blood rune on an adjacent ally that lasts for 1 minute. When you would gain a blood magic effect, you can forgo it, granting it to your ally instead. You can anoint only one ally at a time; if you place another rune, your previous designation ends.

## Traits
