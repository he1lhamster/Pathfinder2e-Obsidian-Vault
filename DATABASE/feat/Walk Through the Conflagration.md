You fall through your own kinetic gate, leaving behind an effigy of flame and reappearing majestically near another fire. You instantly transport yourself, and any items you're wearing and holding, from your current space to a clear space within 120 feet you can observe that's adjacent to an open flame or a creature taking [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]]. If this would bring another creature with you—even if you're carrying it in an extradimensional container—the action fails.
 A whorl of fire surrounds you in a 5-foot emanation either before you depart or after you arrive. Each creature in the area takes 4d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC.

**Level (+3)** The fire damage increases by 1d6.

## Traits

**Fire:**

Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Teleportation:**

Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.
