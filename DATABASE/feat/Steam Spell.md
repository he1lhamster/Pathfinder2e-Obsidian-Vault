You transform your fire spells into steam, making them more effective underwater. If your next action is to Cast a Spell with the fire trait, you can cast it underwater. When you do so, it takes the form of scalding steam. Underwater creatures do not gain the normal fire resistance for being underwater against this spell, but they don't light things on fire or cause [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]], nor do they add other effects that would apply to fire but not steam (at the GM's discretion).

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.

**Undine:**

Undines are planar scions descended from [[DATABASE/monster/Marid|marids]].
