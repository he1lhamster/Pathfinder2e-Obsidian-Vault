You've learned to apply your flashy techniques to thrown weapons as easily as melee attacks. When you have panache, you apply your precise strike damage on ranged Strikes you make with a thrown weapon within that weapon's first range increment. The thrown weapon must be an agile or finesse weapon. This also allows you to make a thrown weapon ranged Strike for [[DATABASE/action/Confident Finisher|Confident Finisher]] and any other finisher that includes a Strike that can benefit from your precise strike.
