Your shadow can contain objects. You can Interact with your shadow to store or retrieve objects, just like you would a mundane container (meaning you spend two Interact actions total to store and then retrieve the object, for example). Your shadow can contain 2 Bulk of objects, which don't count toward the Bulk you're carrying. The items remain solid but take on a shadowy patina while stored this way. Though the items are in your shadow and can be detected normally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Conceal an Object|Conceal the Objects]] unless someone knows to check your shadow for items.
