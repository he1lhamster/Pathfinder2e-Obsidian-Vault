A figure of sand with grasping arms arises in an unoccupied square within 30 feet. You can choose to make it Small or Medium size, and it can flank. When the sand snatcher appears, you can have it attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] one creature adjacent to it that's no more than one size larger than it. This Grapple uses your impulse attack roll instead of an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check and shares your multiple attack penalty. The sand snatcher lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute. Each time you Sustain the impulse, you can have the sand snatcher either Grapple again or [[DATABASE/action/Burrow|Burrow]], [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], or Stride up to 20 feet. Attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] its grasp use your class DC.

## Traits

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
