You move forward, creating an opening for others to follow. Choose one adjacent ally who has a reaction available. You Stride, and that ally can use their reaction to immediately Stride. The ally must end their Stride adjacent to you. If the ally Strides in this way, they don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement. You, however, still trigger those reactions normally.
