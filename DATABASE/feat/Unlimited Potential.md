The laws of magic can limit your mind only if you think you need them, and you've grown past the need for such limits. If your next action is to Cast a Spell of 5th level or lower that has no duration, you don't expend the prepared spell as you cast it.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
