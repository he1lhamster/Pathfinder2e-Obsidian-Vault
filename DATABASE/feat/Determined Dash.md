Nothing can keep you from your enemy. Stride twice. During this movement you ignore difficult terrain, greater difficult terrain, and any effects that would impose a penalty to Speed. You can attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check instead of an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] when moving across narrow surfaces or uneven ground, using the same DC. This doesn't prevent you from being harmed by hazardous terrain. You can increase the number of actions this activity takes to 3 to Stride three times instead.

## Traits
