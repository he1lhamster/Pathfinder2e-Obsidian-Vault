If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell from your spell slots that damages other creatures, you can bend some of that spell’s offensive energy, protecting allies in the area and boosting your own defenses against certain foes. Select any number of targets of the spell and reduce the spell’s damage to those targets by an amount equal to the spell’s level. Until your next turn, when one of those targets damages you, that damage is reduced by twice the spell’s level.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
