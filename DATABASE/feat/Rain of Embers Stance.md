**Requirements** You are unarmored.

---
You enter the stance of an enraged phoenix, holding your fingers as rigid as deadly talons while moving with quick, flickering gestures that dance with biting flames. The only Strikes you can make are fire talon Strikes. These deal 1d4 fire damage; are in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] group; and have the agile, finesse, fire, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
 While in Rain of Embers Stance, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC and fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1).

## Traits

**Fire:**

Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

The martial artist Meleeka Sanvara (CN female human monk) originally met agents of the Pathfinder Society as an enemy when the agents were sent to retrieve an artifact she had stolen. Now, Meleeka works as a Pathfinder agent and occasionally shares the knowledge of her family's unique martial arts techniques with agents who earn her trust.
