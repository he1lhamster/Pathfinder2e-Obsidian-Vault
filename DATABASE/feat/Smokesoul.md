You have a connection to smoke and haze. You gain the Smoke Blending reaction.
 **Smoke Blending** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (sylph) **Trigger** A creature attempts a flat check to target you because you're [[Concealed]] or [[Hidden]] due to fog, haze, mist, or smoke; **Effect** You shroud yourself in smoke, making it harder for your foe to hit you. If you're concealed, the DC of the flat check increases from 5 to 7; if you're hidden, it increases from 11 to 13.
