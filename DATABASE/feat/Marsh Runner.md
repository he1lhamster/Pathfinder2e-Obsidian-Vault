# Marsh Runner <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Lizardfolk</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
**Prerequisites** You have a swim speed

---
You are adept at moving through marshy terrain. When you use the Step action, you can ignore difficult terrain caused by flooding, swamps, or quicksand. In addition, when you use the [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] skill to Balance on narrow surfaces or uneven marshy ground, you aren’t flat-footed, and if you roll a success on the Acrobatics check, you get a critical success instead.

## Traits

**Lizardfolk:**

These reptilian humanoids, also known as iruxi, are extremely adaptable and patient.
