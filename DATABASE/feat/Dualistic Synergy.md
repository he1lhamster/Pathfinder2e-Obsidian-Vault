If your next action is to Cast a Spell from your spell slots, you gain a benefit. If the spell is arcane, you can attempt a skill check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] with a +1 status bonus to the check after casting the spell, or a +2 status bonus if the spell is 7th level or higher. If the spell is primal, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the spell’s level for 1 round. If the spell is a halcyon spell, you gain both benefits.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
