You know there's so much more to sensation than whips and chains—but whips and chains also have their place. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Telekinetic Maneuver|telekinetic maneuver]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Web|web]] once per day each as 2nd-level divine innate spells; in both cases, the spells manifest shadowy chains rather than their usual visual signifiers.
