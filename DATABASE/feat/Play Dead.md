---
You lie [[Prone]] and pretend to be an ordinary skeleton. As long as you don't move or take any actions requiring anything other than your mind, you appear dead. To see through your ruse, another creature must succeed at a check against your [[Deception]] DC, either by [[Seek]] or [[Recall Knowledge]] (typically using [[Religion]] or an appropriate [[Lore]] skill). This ability doesn't work against creatures that already know you're an animate undead unless you have changed your appearance.

## Traits

**Skeleton:**

This undead is made by animating a dead creature’s skeleton with negative energy.
