Your freshly spilled blood is sanctified, and ingesting it causes effects similar to those of [[Holy Water]]. Whenever a fiend, undead, or creature with a weakness to good damage drinks your blood or deals piercing or slashing damage to you with jaws, fangs, or a similar attack, that creature takes 1d6 good damage. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [[Crafting]] checks to [[Craft]] holy water using your own blood as one of the ingredients.
