**Prerequisites** You made a bargain with a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|devil]] or won a legal case or other similar duel of wits against a devil.

---
Your experience in the finer points of bargaining with a devil has awakened a sinister power that now inhabits your left eye. The eye is the same shape and iris color as your normal eye would be, but the sclera is a deep red instead of white and the pupil is a narrow, vertical slit. The eye grants you an abnormal understanding of the loopholes and legal processes employed to trap poor creatures that don't know any better. You gain the Objection reaction. You also become an expert in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Legal Lore]] and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to any check you make to read or negotiate a treatise, contract, or similar text. At 7th level you become a master of Legal Lore, and at 15th level you become legendary in Legal Lore. You can use Legal Lore in place of Perception to detect verbal loopholes, double entendres, hidden meanings, code, or contradictions in a conversation you can hear. This doesn't let you fully understand coded speech but alerts you to its presence.
 **Objection** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (fortune) **Frequency** once per minute; **Trigger** You're about to attempt a saving throw against a linguistic effect; **Effect** Your devil's eye crackles with infernal glee as you discover a loophole in the wording of the triggering effect. You roll your saving throw twice, taking the higher result.

## Traits

**Aftermath:**

This trait describes feats that represent special abilities gained after exposure to the weird and deadly.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
