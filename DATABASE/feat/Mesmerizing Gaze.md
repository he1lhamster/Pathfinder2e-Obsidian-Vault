When you meet someone's gaze, they are unable to look away. Choose one target creature. That creature must succeed at a Will save or be [[Fascinated]] until the end of your next turn; the DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the creature succeeds at its save or its fascination ends due to a hostile action, it becomes temporarily immune to your Mesmerizing Gaze for 1 day.
When you select this feat, it gains either the arcane or occult trait; once you make this choice, you can't change it.
