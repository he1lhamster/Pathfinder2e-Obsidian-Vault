Your elemental familiar trades places with an elemental from its elemental plane. Summon a common creature that has the elemental trait and a level no greater than your level – 4. This creature appears in the same space as your familiar, which disappears for the duration of this impulse. You can Sustain this impulse up to 1 minute. When the impulse ends, the familiar appears in the space the summoned elemental occupied. A familiar can endure this process only so often—if you use this impulse on your familiar more than once per day, it dies as soon as it returns the second time.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
