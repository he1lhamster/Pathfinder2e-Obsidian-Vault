You can aim your bullets not just in three normal dimensions, but in additional dimensions as well, allowing you to fire a magical shot that phases through everything but your target. Make a crossbow or firearm Strike against a foe who's [[DATABASE/condition/Observed|observed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] to you (but not [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]]). The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers and force effects stop the bullet. The shot ignores all cover, the [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] condition, the hidden condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The Strike's damage can't be reduced with a [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction using a non-magical shield.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
