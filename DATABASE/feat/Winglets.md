You're among the few kobolds who grow a set of draconic wings later in life. The wings are initially small and weak; while not enough for full flight, a strong flap allows you to jump further. When [[DATABASE/action/Leap|Leaping]] horizontally, you move an additional 5 feet (this additional distance isn't cumulative with the increased Leap distance from the [[DATABASE/feat/Powerful Leap|Powerful Leap]] feat). You don't automatically fail your checks to [[DATABASE/action/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[DATABASE/action/Long Jump|Long Jump]] if you don't Stride at least 10 feet first. In addition, when you attempt a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet longer than you normally would based on the result of your [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check, though you still can't jump farther than your Speed.
