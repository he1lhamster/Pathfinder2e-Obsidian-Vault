You’ve learned to mimic the abilities of spellcasters by studying their flourishes and words. When you activate a magic item to generate a spell effect, attempt a Deception check. If you succeed against an onlooker’s Perception DC, to that onlooker, you appear to [[Cast a Spell]] instead. Onlookers who successfully [[Recognize Spell]] realize you used a magic item, though those who later successfully [[Identify Magic]] still can’t determine that the source of the effect was a magic item.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
