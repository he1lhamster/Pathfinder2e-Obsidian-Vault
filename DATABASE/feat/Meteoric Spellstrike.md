A trail of energy flows from your target back to you. Make a Spellstrike with a ranged weapon or ranged unarmed attack against a target within the ranged weapon or unarmed attack's first range increment. The spell you cast for the Spellstrike can't be a cantrip or focus spell. Each creature in a line between you and the target, excluding you and the target, takes damage equal to double the spell's level. Determine the damage type as described in [[DATABASE/action/Arcane Cascade|Arcane Cascade]].
