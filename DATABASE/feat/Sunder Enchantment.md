You can focus your superstition to break the magic of an item, in addition to destroying freestanding spells and those active on creatures. When you Sunder a Spell, you can instead attempt to counteract either an unattended magic item or one of your target's magic items. If your counteract attempt succeeds, the item becomes a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes. If you target an artifact, an intelligent item, or a particularly powerful item, your counteract attempt automatically fails.
