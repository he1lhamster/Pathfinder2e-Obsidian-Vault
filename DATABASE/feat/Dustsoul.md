Your [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Earth|earth elemental]] ancestor's influence manifests in you as dust and dirt, like the soil of a field or the hot desert sands. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]]. If you would automatically become trained in Survival (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can sustain yourself on dirt and ash instead of normal food and water.
