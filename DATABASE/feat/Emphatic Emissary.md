You can tell when diplomacy has failed and a meeting is close to unraveling or falling to blows. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your initiative roll. During your first turn in combat, you can use your Disarming Smile, targeting every [[DATABASE/condition/Hostile|hostile]] intelligent humanoid creature that can see you but has yet to act. If you choose to sustain your Disarming Smile, you sustain the effect for only one creature, as normal.
