Make a Strike against the creature that triggered your champion's reaction. If you hit, the target takes double the extra damage from your reaction and must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be drained 1. Regardless of the result, the creature is temporarily immune to your Gruesome Strike for 24 hours.
