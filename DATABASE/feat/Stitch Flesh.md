**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Medicine]]

---
You can use [[Treat Wounds]] to restore Hit Points to undead creatures, not just living ones. The techniques you use to do so vary, but all require sutures, bandages, and other tools included in [[Healer's Tools]]. Some conditions that might raise the DC of treating undead's wounds differ from that of living creatures. For instance, the GM might increase the DC if the undead being treated is in a church of [[Pharasma]] or the wounds were caused by powerful positive energy.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
