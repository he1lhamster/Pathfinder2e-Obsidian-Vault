When you succeed at identifying a creature using [[Recall Knowledge]], that creature is [[Flat-Footed]] against your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically succeed, it's flat-footed against your attacks for 1 minute. This feat serves as the rogue's [[Mastermind]] racket for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.
