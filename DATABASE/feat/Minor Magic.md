You’ve dabbled in minor magical abilities. Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal magic, and gain two cantrips from the common cantrips available to that tradition. You gain the Cast a Spell activity, your key spellcasting ability is Charisma, and you’re trained in spell attack rolls and DCs for the tradition you chose.
