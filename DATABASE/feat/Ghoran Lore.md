The very first memories ghorans have are those of their creation, and even after thousands of years, those memories have never faded for you. You become trained in [[Arcana]] and [[Nature]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[Lore]].

## Traits
