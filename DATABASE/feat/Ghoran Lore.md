The very first memories ghorans have are those of their creation, and even after thousands of years, those memories have never faded for you. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Ghoran Lore]].

## Traits
