While your usual diplomacy is well intentioned, you know that sometimes those same skills will need to be turned to deception. In a flash, you draw a sheathed or concealed agile or finesse weapon and make a melee Strike. The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against your Strike. You then roll [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] for initiative.
