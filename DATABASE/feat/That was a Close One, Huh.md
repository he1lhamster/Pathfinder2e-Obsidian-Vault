---
You laugh innocently about the inexplicable luck of your last shot hitting its mark or how close the attack that just missed you came to taking your head off, causing your foes to second guess whether it's a good idea to oppose you in battle. Attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] either the foe you hit with [[DATABASE/feat/Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication|Accidental Shot]] or the foe that missed you due to [[DATABASE/feat/Lucky Escape|Lucky Escape]]. You use [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] instead of Intimidation to attempt the check to Demoralize.
