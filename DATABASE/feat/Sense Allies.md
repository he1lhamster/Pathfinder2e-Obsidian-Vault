Like many humans raised in a close-knit community, you have always been strongly attuned to the presence of others. Willing allies that you are aware of within 60 feet that would otherwise be [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] by you are instead [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from you. The flat check for you to target willing allies within 60 feet that are hidden from you is 5 instead of 11.
