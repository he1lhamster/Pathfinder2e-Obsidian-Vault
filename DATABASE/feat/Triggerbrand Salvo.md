# Triggerbrand Salvo <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Flourish</span><span class="item-trait">Gunslinger</span>
**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Prerequisites** [[Way of the Triggerbrand]]
**Requirements** You're wielding a combination weapon.

---
You slice, stab, or batter your opponent with the melee portion of your combination weapon before pulling the trigger at point-blank range. Make a melee Strike with your combination weapon. If the Strike is successful, you can immediately make a ranged Strike against the same target with that combination weapon, and you get a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll. This counts as two attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after making both attacks.

## Traits

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
