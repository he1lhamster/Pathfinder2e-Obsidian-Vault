---
You raise your arms to the sky and pray fervently, surrounding yourself in a beacon of holy light. The beacon sheds bright light in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on you until the beginning of your next turn. Evil creatures in the area must succeed at a Will save equal to your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or become [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Divine:**

This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Evocation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.

**Light:**

Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
