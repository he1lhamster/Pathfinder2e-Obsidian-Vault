The magic in your blood is unpredictable. When you make your daily preparations, roll 1d12 twice and consult the following list. 1: [[Acid Arrow]]; 2: [[Blur]]; 3: [[Hideous Laughter]]; 4: [[Humanoid Form]]; 5: [[Illusory Object]]; 6: [[Mirror Image]]; 7: [[Resist Energy]]; 8: [[See Invisibility]]; 9: [[Shatter]]; 10: [[Sound Burst]]; 11: [[Spider Climb]]; 12: [[Telekinetic Maneuver]]. You can cast each of those two spells once during the following day (or one spell twice if you rolled doubles) as 2nd-level divine innate spells.
