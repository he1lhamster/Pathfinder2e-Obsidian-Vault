Time spent tending to your own form has unlocked your ability to fix other things. You can cast 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Mending|mending]] once per day as an arcane innate spell. At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell level. Even though you're alive and not an object, and you can't normally recover Hit Points from effects that repair objects (like the [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repair]] skill), you can target yourself with this innate spell and use it to recover Hit Points.
