**Trigger** You use [[DATABASE/action/Flurry of Blows|Flurry of Blows]] to make two ranged piercing weapon Strikes against the same target.

---
You target your opponent's clothing, equipment, or loose flesh with piercing projectiles to pin them to the ground or a nearby surface. If both your attacks hit, the target must succeed at a Reflex save against your class DC or become [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] until it or an adjacent creature succeeds at a DC 10 Athletics check to remove the pinning projectiles. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Water|water elemental]] or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.
