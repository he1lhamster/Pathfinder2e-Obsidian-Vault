You can capably deliver toxins with a [[DATABASE/weapon/Blowgun|blowgun]]. Your blowgun Strikes can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance. If you critically succeed at an attack roll using a blowgun loaded with a dart you've poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison's initial save, the target critically fails instead.
