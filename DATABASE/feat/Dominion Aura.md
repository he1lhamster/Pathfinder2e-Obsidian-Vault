For a short time, you fully manifest the expectations of the god destroyer within you. All creatures within a 10-foot emanation take 8d6 force damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails this save is also knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. For 1 minute, any creature who ends its turn within the 10-foot emanation takes 5d6 force damage with a basic Fortitude save. If you aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]], you can choose to become drained 2 when you use Dominion Aura to increase the radius of the emanation from 10 feet to 20 feet.

An aura is an emanation that continually ebbs out from you, affecting creatures within a certain radius. Aura can also refer to the magical signature of an item or a creature with a strong alignment.

**Divine:**

This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Evocation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.

**Force:**

Effects with this trait deal force damage or create objects made of pure magical force.

**Tiefling:**

A creature with this trait has the tiefling versatile heritage. Tieflings are [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Planar Scion|planar scions]] descended from fiends. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tieflings.
