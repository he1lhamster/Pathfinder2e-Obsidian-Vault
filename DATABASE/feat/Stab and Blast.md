**Requirements** You're wielding a firearm with an attached [[Bayonet]] or [[Reinforced Stock]], a [[Fire Lance]], or a combination weapon.

---
You slice or smash your opponent with the melee portion of your weapon before pulling the trigger at point-blank range. Make a melee Strike with the required weapon. If the Strike is successful, you can immediately make a ranged Strike against the same target with a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll. This counts as two attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after making both attacks.

## Traits

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
