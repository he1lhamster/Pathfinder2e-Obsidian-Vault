Your eyes are accustomed to the harsh glare of the sun on snow and ice. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects that inflict the [[Dazzled]] condition. Snow doesn't impair your vision; you ignore [[Concealed]] from snowfall. Your skin becomes cold to the touch, and sometimes frost forms on you. You are protected from severe cold and heat.
