You've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the Inner Sphere. You gain the trained proficiency in your choice of [[Survival]] and either [[Arcana]] or [[Nature]]. If you would automatically become trained in Survival (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in the [[Lore]] associated with your Elemental Plane of origin (such as [[Plane of Fire]] Lore).
