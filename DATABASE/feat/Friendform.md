PFS Note

---
The shared bond between you and your allies allows you to act on their behalf. During your daily preparations, you can perform a simple ritual with up to five willing Small or Medium humanoids, where participants exchange minor tokens of personal significance. As long as you hold onto a participant's token, you can assume their form with your [[DATABASE/action/Change Shape|Change Shape]] ability, gaining a +4 status bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to pass as that person and adding your level to the check even if you're untrained. You lose access to a participant's form if they're not carrying your token or if you use the ritual again.
