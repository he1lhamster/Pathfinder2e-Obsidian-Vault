You become one with a devastating thunderstorm from the [[Plane of Air]], placing a crown of lightning upon your brow. Sparks flash in your eyes, and lightning strikes constantly in the air around you as howling winds lift you from the ground.

* Any creature that enters your kinetic aura or ends its turn there takes 2d12 electricity damage.
* If you don't have a fly Speed, you gain a 20-foot fly Speed. If you have the [[Cyclonic Ascent]] impulse, you instead gain that fly Speed and the extra benefits.
* You gain a +10-foot status bonus to all your Speeds.
* Your air [[Elemental Blast]] deal an additional 1d12 electricity damage.

## Traits

**Air:**

Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air with various degrees of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies.

**Electricity:**

Effects with this trait deal electricity damage. A creature with this trait has a magical connection to electricity.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
