By reducing redundant systems and streamlining essential functions, you have made it easier for the vehicle to operate with fewer crew. Reduce the number of crew required to operate your signature vehicle by 25%. For example, you would reduce a sailing ship from needing 1 pilot and 8 crew to 1 pilot and 6 crew. This adjustment only affects the number of crew needed to operate the vehicle; it doesn't reduce the vehicle's need for a pilot.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
