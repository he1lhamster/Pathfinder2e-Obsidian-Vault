Striking the ground with the gravity of the deepest rocks, you cause an earthquake. This has the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Earthquake|earthquake]] but comes from you, with an area of a 60-foot cone or an emanation with the same size as your kinetic aura. You and your space are unaffected by the quake. The fissures are only 10 feet deep, and the DC of the flat check for a collapse is 4 higher.

---
**Level (16th)** Fissures are 20 feet deep, and the DC of the flat check is 2 higher.
**Level (20th)** The fissures and flat check are unchanged from the spell.

## Traits

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
