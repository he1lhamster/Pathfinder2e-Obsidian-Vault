You understand the need for law enforcement doctrine to adapt to the ever-changing innovations in technology and arcana. Your training in special weapons and tactics give you access to unusual techniques to respond to clockwork- and magic-related crimes. You apply special additives to a loaded firearm. On your next Strike with that firearm before the end of your turn, you deal an additional 2d6 damage if the target is a construct, and you can treat the ammunition as your choice of [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]] or [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Weapon|adamantine]]. At 18th level, this additional damage increases to 3d6, and you can choose to instead treat the ammunition as [[DATABASE/equipment/Orichalcum Weapon|orichalcum]].
