<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
**Archetype** [[Sleepwalker]]
**Prerequisites** expert in [[Occultism]]

---
You've learned to manipulate states of consciousness, beginning with your own. You can send yourself into a half-awake, daydreaming state and gain the Daydream Trance action.
 **Daydream Trance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (enchantment, mental, occult) You fall into a half-sleeping trance. This lasts for 1 minute or until you fall [[Unconscious]], whichever comes first. You can voluntarily end your trance by taking a single action, which has a concentrate trait, and succeeding at a Will save against your own class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Once your trance ends, you can't enter a Daydream Trance again for 1 minute. While you're in your trance, you gain the following effects:

* You gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves. This bonus increases to +2 against mental effects. If you're legendary in Occultism, the bonus against mental effects increases to +3.
* You take a –1 penalty to Perception checks and initiative rolls.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sleepwalker archetype.
