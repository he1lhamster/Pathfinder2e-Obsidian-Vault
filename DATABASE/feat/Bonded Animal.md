---
You forge strong connections with animals. You can spend 7 days of downtime regularly interacting with a normal animal (not a companion or other special animal) that is friendly or helpful to you. After this duration, attempt a DC 20 [[Nature Domain]] check. If successful, you bond with the animal. The animal is permanently [[Helpful]] to you, unless you do something egregious to break your bond. A helpful animal is easier to direct, as described under [[Command an Animal]].
 Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had. You can't have both a bonded animal and an animal companion (though you can have both a bonded animal and a familiar).

## Traits

**Downtime:**

An activity with this trait takes a day or more, and can be used only during downtime.

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat.
