It seems impossible, but you've analyzed every angle and are able to just keep pulling out exactly the item you need, even in far-flung locations. You can use [[DATABASE/feat/Prescient Planner|Prescient Planner]] even if you have already used it after purchasing goods, and you can use it as a single action instead of a 2-action activity, during which you Interact to draw the item. In addition, five times per day, you can use Prescient Planner to pull out a common consumable item up to 6 levels lower than your level.
