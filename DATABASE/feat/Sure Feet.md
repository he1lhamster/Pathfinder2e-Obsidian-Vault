Whether keeping your balance or scrambling up a tricky climb, your hairy, calloused feet easily find purchase. If you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] or an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], you get a critical success instead. You're not [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] when you attempt to Balance or Climb.
