You launch yourself at a foe. Make a Leap or attempt a High Jump or Long Jump. At the end of the jump, if you’re adjacent to a foe, you can immediately Strike that foe with an unarmed attack, even if the foe is in mid-air. You fall to the ground after the Strike. If the distance you fall is no more than the height of your jump, you land upright and take no damage.
