**Requirements** You have a creature grabbed or restrained.

---
You pinch crucial points of your target’s nervous system, impeding its ability to function. Attempt an Athletics check to Grapple the creature, with the following success and critical success effects instead of the usual effects.
**Critical Success** The target falls unconscious for 1 minute, though it remains standing and doesn’t drop what it holds.
**Success** The target is clumsy 1 until the end of its next turn.

## Traits

**Incapacitation:**

An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.
