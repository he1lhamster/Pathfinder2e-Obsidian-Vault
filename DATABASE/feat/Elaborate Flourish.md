You embellish your spellcasting with entrancing flourishes and grand pronouncements, making it harder to identify or counter. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, creatures with the ability to Cast that Spell don't automatically know what the spell is. In addition, creatures that witness your spellcasting take a –2 circumstance penalty to checks to identify the spell with [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] and checks to counteract the spell during its casting (such as with [[DATABASE/feat/Counterspell|Counterspell]]).

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
