Spines, flame jets, and holy blasts are just some of the ways your eidolon might strike from a distance. It gains a ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 30 feet that deals 1d4 damage and has the magical and propulsive traits. When you select this feat, choose a damage type: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing, positive, or slashing. If your eidolon is a celestial, fiend, or monitor with an alignment other than true neutral, you can choose a damage type in its alignment.

## Traits

**Evolution:**

Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.
