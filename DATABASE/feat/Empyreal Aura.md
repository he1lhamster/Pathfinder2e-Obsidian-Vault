As an ultimate foe of evil and protector of the innocent, your very presence is a ward against evil. Each evil creature within 30 feet of you at the end of your turn must succeed at a Will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or else become [[Slowed]] (slowed 2 on a critical failure). On a successful save, the creature is temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
