Your enhanced fey connection affords you a warmer reception from creatures of the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]] as well as tools to foil their tricks. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to both Perception checks and saving throws against fey.
 In addition, whenever you meet a fey creature in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a –5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.
**Special** If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Glad-Hand|Glad-Hand]] skill feat, you don’t take the penalty on your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is a fey.
