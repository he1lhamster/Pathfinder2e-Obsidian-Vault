Your desire for stimulation has led you from one pursuit to another and granted you a smattering of expertise with myriad crafts and professions. You reflect on snippets you’ve learned to temporarily become trained in one [[Lore]] skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts for 10 minutes or until you critically fail a check with that skill. Since this training is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option like a feat or a skill increase.
