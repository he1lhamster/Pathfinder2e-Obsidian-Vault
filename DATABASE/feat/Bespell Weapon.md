You siphon the residual energy from the last spell you cast into one weapon you're wielding. Until the end of your turn, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of a type depending on the school of the spell you just cast.

* **Abjuration** force damage 
* **Conjuration or Transmutation** the same type as the weapon 
* **Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion** mental damage 
* **Evocation** a type the spell dealt, or force damage if the spell didn't deal damage 
* **Necromancy** negative damage
