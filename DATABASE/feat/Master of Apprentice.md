Teaching is a difficult art form, but you've gotten a pretty good handle on it. When you [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]] or [[DATABASE/action/Earn Income|Earn Income]] during downtime, you can also attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] another creature doing the same with the same skill if they have a lower proficiency bonus than you. If you succeed, they can use the better result between your check and their own check.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
