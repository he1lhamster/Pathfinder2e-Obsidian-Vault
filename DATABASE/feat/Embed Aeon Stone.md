You discover the secrets to embedding [[DATABASE/equipment/Aeon Stone|aeon stones]] into your flesh. You spend 1 day attuning to an _aeon stone_ and physically embedding it in your skin. While the stone is embedded this way, you gain the benefits of the _aeon stone_ as if it were orbiting above your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. _Aeon stones_ in your flesh must be invested to function, as usual.
 You can also use this activity to safely remove an embedded _aeon stone_ in 1 day. Someone without this feat can attempt to surgically remove it safely by spending 1 day and succeeding at a DC 30 [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] check, or hastily by simply ripping it from a corpse.
