You mix a special additive into your elixir that calms the drinker's body and mind. The elixir of life attempts to counteract one fear effect or one effect imposing the [[Paralyzed]] condition on the drinker, using the item's level and a counteract modifier equal to your class DC – 10.

## Traits

**Additive 2:**

Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the [[Quick Alchemy]] action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level.
