Your spirit guide enhances your attacks with occult power. Make a Strike with a weapon that has at least one fundamental rune. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. The Strike has the effects of the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] property rune and deals an additional 2d6 force damage. If your weapon has a [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|major striking]] rune, this Strike instead deals 3d6 force damage.
