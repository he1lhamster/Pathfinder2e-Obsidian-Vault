You twist your hand in front of the blow, ensuring the enemy's attack shatters the required _holy water_ or bomb. The creature takes the on-hit and splash damage from the _holy water_ or required bomb, not counting any additional effects you would add or apply when you throw the bomb, such as weapon specialization or [[DATABASE/feat/Calculated Splash|Calculated Splash]]. You're splashed by the _holy water_ or required bomb, although since positive damage harms only undead and creatures with [[DATABASE/monsterability/Negative Healing|negative healing]], it's unlikely you will take damage.
