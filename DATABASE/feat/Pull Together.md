Your people are very reliable, and their swift decision-making keeps most projects from getting too far off track. Once per Kingdom turn when you roll a critical failure on a Kingdom skill check, attempt a DC 11 flat check. If this succeeds, your citizens heed the call to put in extra work to mitigate the disaster; treat the Kingdom skill check result as failure instead. The DC of this flat check increases by 5 each time you subsequently use it, but it decreases by 1 (to a minimum of 11) for each Kingdom turn that passes when you do not use it.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
