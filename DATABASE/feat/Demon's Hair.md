**Source** [[Pathfinder 168. King of the Mountain]]
**Prerequisites** [[Living Hair]]

---
Your hair constantly wriggles and writhes like that of your rival, Syu Tak-nwa. Your damage die of your hair unarmed Strike increases by one step and it gains the reach and versatile slashing traits. Your familiar assumes partial control over your hair; as long as your familiar is alive and within 30 feet, you are permanently [[Quickened]], and you can use the extra action only to make a hair Strike. You can deliver hexes through your hair. When you successfully cast a non-cantrip hex that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a hair Strike against them before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect.
**Special** If your hair already has the reach trait, it instead gains the sweep trait.
