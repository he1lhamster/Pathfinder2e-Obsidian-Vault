You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only on ship's rigging or similar ropes. Whenever you succeed at an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]] a rope or an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] while Climbing or Balancing on a rope.
