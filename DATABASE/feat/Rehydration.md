You surround your body with a thin layer of water drawn from the moisture in the air. You can spend one hour resting to rehydrate your gills and skin, which counts as submerging your body in water. At the GM's discretion, incredibly dry areas, such as deserts, might not have enough moisture in the air for your Rehydration to work.

## Traits

**Azarketi:**

Amphibious humanoids who live among the seas of the Inner Sea region, said to have descended from the people of Azlant. Sometimes known as gillmen or Low Azlanti.
Azarketis craft and use these weapons.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Transmutation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.

**Water:**

Effects with the water trait either manipulate or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a magical connection to the element. Planes with this trait are mostly liquid, perhaps with pockets of breathable air.
