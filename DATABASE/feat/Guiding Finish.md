**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Requirements** You are wielding only a single one-handed melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.

---
Using your weapon as a lever, you force your opponent to end up right where you want them. Make a Strike with the required weapon. If the Strike hits, you can move the target up to 10 feet into a space in your reach. You can move the target through your space during this movement. This follows the forced movement rules. Your Strike gains the following failure effect.
**Failure** You can force the creature to move as you would on a success, but you can move the target only 5 feet.

## Traits

**Press:**

Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can't use one when it's not your turn, even if you use the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ready|Ready]] activity.
