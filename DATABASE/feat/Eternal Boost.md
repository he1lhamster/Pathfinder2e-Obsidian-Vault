Your link with your eidolon is so intense that you continuously reinforce its abilities. You are permanently [[Quickened]]; you can use your extra action only to cast [[Boost Eidolon]] or [[Reinforce Eidolon]]. While in exploration mode, you can declare that you are also continually casting _boost eidolon_ or _reinforce eidolon_ even while using a different exploration activity. If you do, even before your first turn in a combat encounter, that cantrip is active as if you had cast it on your previous turn.
