Your forceful blows shatter objects with ease. While you are raging, your melee Strikes ignore 5 points of an object's Hardness. If you have the devastator class feature, you instead ignore 10 points of an object's Hardness.

## Traits

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
