You broaden your magical studies, allowing you to find the right path, detect objects, and conceal those objects from unscrupulous rivals. You can cast [[Augury]], [[Locate]], and [[Nondetection]] as occult innate spells, each once per day. You can cast this _nondetection_ spell only on an object, and it is automatically heightened to the same spell level as your cantrips from [[Magical Scholastics]].
