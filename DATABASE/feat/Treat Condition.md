**Requirements** You are holding [[Healer's Tools]], or you are wearing them and have a hand free.

---
You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the [[Clumsy]], [[Enfeebled]], or [[Sickened]] condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a counteract check against the condition, using your [[Medicine]] modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have [[Legendary Medic]]; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a good character gains from carrying an [[Unholy]] weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.
**Critical Success** Reduce the condition value by 2.
**Success** Reduce the condition value by 1.
**Critical Failure** Increase the condition value by 1.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Healing:**

A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
