Your body and equipment appear to be made of stone as you hold perfectly still. Until the next time you act, you appear to be a statue and do not need to eat, drink, or breathe, but you are [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]. Your [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] DC to pass as a statue is equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus (do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).
