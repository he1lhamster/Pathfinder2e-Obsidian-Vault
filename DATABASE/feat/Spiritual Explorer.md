You're familiar with the danger that lingering spirits can pose to an unwary adventurer, and you're particularly attuned to their presence. Even if you aren't [[DATABASE/action/Search|Searching]] in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find haunts that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find a particular haunt.
