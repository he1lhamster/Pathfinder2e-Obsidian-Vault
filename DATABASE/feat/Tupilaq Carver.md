You know the truth behind old stories that tell of sending a fetish of bone and sinew to seek vengeance. These old magics allow you to conjure constructs with ease. Add the [[DATABASE/spell/Summon Construct|summon construct]] spell to your spell list. The constructs you summon have a distinct ivory scrimshaw appearance, and if you include a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature’s body as part of the spell’s material component, the summoned construct gains a +4 status bonus to Perception checks to sense or locate that creature.
