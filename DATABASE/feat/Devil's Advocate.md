You know more about the habits of devils than is entirely safe. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks against [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|devils]] and saving throws against their abilities. In addition, whenever you meet a devil in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a –5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.
**Special** If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Glad-Hand|Glad-Hand]] skill feat, you don’t take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is a devil.
