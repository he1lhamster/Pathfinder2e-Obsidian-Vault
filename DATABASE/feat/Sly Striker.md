Your attacks deal more damage, even against creatures that aren’t flat-footed. When you succeed or critically succeed at a Strike against a creature that isn’t flat-footed, you also deal 1d6 precision damage. This applies only if you’re using a weapon or unarmed attack you could deal sneak attack damage with. At 14th level, if you would normally deal 3d6 or more sneak attack damage to flat-footed creatures, you deal 2d6 precision damage to creatures that aren’t flat-footed.
