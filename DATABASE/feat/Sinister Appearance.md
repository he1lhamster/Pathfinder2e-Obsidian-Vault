You possess horns, a tail, or red eyes, or could otherwise be mistaken for a [[Tiefling]]. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Intimidation]]. If you would automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Deception]] checks to [[Impersonate]] when pretending to be a version of yourself who is a tiefling.
