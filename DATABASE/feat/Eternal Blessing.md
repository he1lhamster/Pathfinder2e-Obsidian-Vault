Your good deeds have brought your deity’s grace to you for all of eternity. You’re continuously surrounded by a [[DATABASE/spell/Bless|bless]] spell with a spell level equal to half your level (rounded up). The radius is 15 feet, and you can’t increase it. You can Dismiss the spell; if you do, it returns automatically after 1 minute.
