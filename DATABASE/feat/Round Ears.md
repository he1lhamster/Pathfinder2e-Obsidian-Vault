# Round Ears <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Half-Elf</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]]

---
Your elven lineage is subtle enough that you look barely different from other humans, and you’ve learned to use that to your advantage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] (or another skill of your choice, if you were already trained in Deception). You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend you aren’t a half-elf. Observers are never granted circumstance bonuses to Perception checks due to you Impersonating a full-blooded human, and you never take circumstance penalties due to you Impersonating a full-blooded human.
**Special** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
