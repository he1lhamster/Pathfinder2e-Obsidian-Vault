You use Emerald Bough techniques to create a small extradimensional space called a hideaway that lasts as long as you are conscious. The hideaway functions as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Bag of Holding|type I bag of holding]], but has no Bulk and takes no hands; it holds one object with a maximum Bulk equal to your highest mental ability score modifier; as you open the hideaway with pure thought, activating it to retrieve an item is a free action with the envision component instead of a single action with the Interact component. The hideaway’s access point appears as an obviously magical gap within 1 foot of your body. Only you can access the hideaway; you can you use an Interact action each round to physically hold it open for another person. A successful [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] spell or similar effect against your spell DC and the hideaway’s counteract level of 2 expels the object; the object is also expelled if you become unconscious. After a successful _dispel magic _spell or when you become conscious again, the hideaway immediately reforms with no additional action from you. You can also dismiss the hideaway (if it is empty) or re-form it using a single action with the envision component.
