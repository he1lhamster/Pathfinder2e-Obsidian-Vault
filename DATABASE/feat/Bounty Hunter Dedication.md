When focused on finding your quarry, you're relentless. You gain the [[Hunt Prey]] action. You can use Hunt Prey to designate only a creature that you've seen, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Gather Information]] regarding your prey.
 If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in [[Survival]] and gain the circumstance bonus to Gather Information about your prey; you can still designate a creature you're tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bounty hunter archetype.
