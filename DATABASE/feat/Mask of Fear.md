# Mask of Fear <span class="action-icon">4</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 13</span>

<span class="item-trait">Orc</span>
**Source** [[Ancestry Guide]] 
**Prerequisites** [[Orc Warmask]]
**Trigger** You start your turn with the [[Frightened]] condition.
**Requirements** You're wearing your _warmask_.

---
Your _warmask_ burns off of your face, releasing your apprehension. You remove the frightened condition. Your _warmask_ is destroyed, and you can't reapply it until your next daily preparations.
**Special** You can use this free action even if you have a condition tied to the frightened condition that would normally prevent you from using a free action, such as “[[Fleeing]] as long as you're frightened” or “[[Paralyzed]] as long as you're frightened.”
