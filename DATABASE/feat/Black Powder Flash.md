If the characters agree to Nixbrix's challenge to defeat Bitey or otherwise impress the gang leader, he offers to teach them a few tricks. The characters gain access to the feats in the Black-Powder Berserkers section on page 79, even if they aren't from Alkenstar or the Mana Wastes, though they still must meet the feats' other prerequisites to take them.
