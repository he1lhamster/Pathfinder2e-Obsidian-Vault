**Requirements** You have a free hand.

A directed beam of heat or an arc of lightning is one of the simplest ways to project energy. You fire a blast or beam from one hand. Make an attack roll against a creature within 30 feet. If you succeed, the beam deals 1d6 damage for every 2 levels you have to the target, or double damage on a critical success.
**Awakening** Your beams blast through targets. Instead of making an attack roll to damage a single creature within 30 feet, you can use Blasting Beams as a 2-action activity to damage all creatures in a 60-foot line, with a basic Reflex save.
**Awakening** You can choose to launch smaller, quicker beams from your eyes instead. These deal d4s instead of d6s, but the attack has the agile trait, and you don't need a hand free to make it, though your eyes must be uncovered.

## Traits

**Attack:**

An ability with this trait involves an attack. For each attack you make beyond the first on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty.

**Deviant:**

This trait describes strange supernatural or paranormal abilities.

**Evocation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
 Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
