Rumors suggest this technique was pioneered by knights who undertook missions for Clarethe Iomedar at the half-moon, but many Crimson Reclaimers have since mastered it. You learn the [[DATABASE/spell/For Love, For Lightning|for love, for lightning]] focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs. Charisma is the key spellcasting ability for knight reclaimant focus spells.
