You spend 10 minutes communing with spirits of earth and stone, requesting shelter. At the end of this time, the earth rises and opens, forming a small cave or earthen mound 20 feet in diameter and 10 feet high. This cave has the structure trait and the same restrictions as structures created by magic items. The cave has a single entrance and provides shelter from the elements. The cave remains for 12 hours or until you spend 10 minutes coaxing the earth to close.

## Traits

**Conjuration:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the conjuration school of magic, typically involving summoning, creation, teleportation, or moving things from place to place.

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Exploration:**

An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
