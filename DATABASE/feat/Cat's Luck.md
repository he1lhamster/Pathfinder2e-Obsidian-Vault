**Catfolk:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the [[Catfolk]] ancestry. Catfolk are humanoids with feline features. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by catfolk. An item with this trait is created and used by catfolk.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
