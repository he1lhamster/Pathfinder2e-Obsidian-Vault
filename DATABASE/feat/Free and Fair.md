Your reputation for transparency and fairness in conducting elections, appointments, and other changes in government inspires tremendous public trust. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Loyalty-based checks attempted as part of the [[DATABASE/action/New Leadership|New Leadership]] and [[DATABASE/action/Pledge of Fealty|Pledge of Fealty]] activities. If you fail or critically fail such a check, you can spend 2 RP to reroll the check (but without the +2 circumstance bonus); attempting this adds the Fortune trait. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse than the original roll.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Kingdom:**

A kingdom gains feats as it increases in level. Some feats are general-purpose abilities that apply all the time. Others grant benefits to specific kingdom activities or events or allow kingdoms to perform special activities. Each time a kingdom gains a feat, players can select any feat whose level does not exceed their kingdom's level and whose prerequisites their kingdom satisfies.
