All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a [[Deception]], [[Society]], or appropriate [[Lore]] check against your Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.
 Once you've gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your [[Diplomacy]] and Deception checks with them.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Linguistic:**

An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
