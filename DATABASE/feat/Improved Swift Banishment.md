You easily banish creatures with your weapon. You can use Swift Banishment as long as you have a spell slot of 5th level or higher remaining, even if you don’t have [[DATABASE/spell/Banishment|banishment]] prepared. You must sacrifice a prepared spell of 5th level or higher, and the _banishment_ effect you create is heightened to the level of that spell. Your weapon serves as the special material component of _banishment_, causing the target to take the –2 penalty to its save against any _banishment_ you cast using Swift Banishment.
