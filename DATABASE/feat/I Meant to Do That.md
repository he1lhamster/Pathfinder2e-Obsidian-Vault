Somehow your stray bullet causes an unintended reaction that creates a problem for your enemy: perhaps a ricochet knocks your foe's weapon away or they stumble over stray debris in an attempt to dodge your bullets. Roll a [[Deception]] check to attempt to [[Shove]], [[Trip]], or [[Disarm]] the foe you missed.
