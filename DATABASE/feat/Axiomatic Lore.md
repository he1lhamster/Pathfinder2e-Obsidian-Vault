You possess a strong understanding of process among mortals and lawful outsiders alike. The source of this knowledge might be intuition, study, or a childhood spent among other aphorites. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Axis Lore]].
