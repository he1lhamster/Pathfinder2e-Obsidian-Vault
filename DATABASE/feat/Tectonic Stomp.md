You cause minor tremors that topple your enemies. All creatures in a 30-foot emanation who are standing on the ground take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 2 levels you have, with a basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save also falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
**Awakening** Your stomp also ejects large fragments from the ground. You raise up to three stone chunks from the ground in unoccupied squares in the emanation; the stones can't be adjacent to one another. The chunks are 5 feet tall, block movement, and are large enough to [[DATABASE/action/Take Cover|Take Cover]] behind. They have AC 10, Hardness 8, and Hit Points equal to your level. They are immune to critical hits and precision damage. A stone chunk crumbles away when it has 0 Hit Points, and all of them crumble after 1 minute or when you use Tectonic Stomp again.
**Awakening** Your stomp rattles those who fail horribly. A creature that critically fails its save is also [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].

## Traits

**Deviant:**

This trait describes strange supernatural or paranormal abilities.

**Evocation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
 Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
