As you call down divine power, you can prevent some enemies from benefiting or some allies from being hurt. When you cast a version of [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] that has an area, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) that are not targeted by the spell.
