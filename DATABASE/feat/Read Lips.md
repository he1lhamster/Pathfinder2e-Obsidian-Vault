You can read lips of others nearby who you can clearly see. When you're at your leisure, you can do this automatically. In encounter mode or when attempting a more difficult feat of lipreading, you're [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] during each round in which you focus on lip movements, and you must succeed at a [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] check (DC determined by the GM) to successfully read someone's lips. In either case, the language read must be one that you know.

## Traits

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat.
