You install one of your snares prepared for quick deployment in a space that's occupied by an opponent. It must be a snare that normally takes 1 minute or less to [[Craft]]. The snare automatically triggers, but it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to any applicable save DC, as well as any attack rolls or other checks the snare attempts.
