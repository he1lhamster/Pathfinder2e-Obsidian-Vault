Just before going to sleep, you can perform a 10-minute ward to protect the slumber of up to eight creatures within 30 feet of you. All creatures affected by the ritual gain a +4 status bonus on saving throws against [[Nightmare]], a [[Night Hag]] dream haunting, or other effects influencing dreams (such as those provided by this archetype) until your next daily preparations. They heal double the usual amount of Hit Points from resting.
