Your mother was a [[DATABASE/monster/Sea Hag|sea hag]], granting you one sea-green or blue eye. You find comfort both in the sea and on the shore. Whenever you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]], you get a critical success instead. If you end your turn in water without having succeeded at a Swim action that round, you don't sink (but you might still be moved by the current).
