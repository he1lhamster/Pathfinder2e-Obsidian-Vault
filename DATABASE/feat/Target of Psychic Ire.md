Your magic saturates your surroundings with hateful psychic energy. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more actions to cast and targets a creature.

---
**Amp** Choose one target of the spell. Psychic phenomena turn themselves on the target—typically, objects fling themselves at the creature. At the beginning of each of the target's turns, it takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage for each spell level of the psi cantrip this amp was added to, with a basic Reflex save. The target remains marked by psychic ire for 3 rounds. The effect persists even if you fall unconscious or leave the area.

## Traits

**Amp:**

An amp is a special thoughtform that modifies the properties of your psi cantrips. Psi cantrips each have their own amp, and feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps.

**Evocation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.
