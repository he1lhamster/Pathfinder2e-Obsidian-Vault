Your spell disorients your targets with a metallic clangor. If the next action you use this turn is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that deals damage in an area (such as a burst, line, or cone), the spell deals an additional 1d8 sonic damage and all creatures who fail their save against the spell are [[Deafened]] for 1 round. Targets who critically fail their saves against this spell are instead deafened for 1 minute. The spell gains the sonic trait.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Metal:**

Effects with the metal trait conjure or manipulate metal. Those that manipulate metal have no effect in an area without metal. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of metal or have a connection to magical metal.

**Spellshape:**

Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a spellshape action directly before casting the spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than casting a spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself.
