Your blood bears the mark of a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demon]], a living embodiment of sin from the fetid depths of the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]]. Demonic power pulses through your veins and manifests in a different way for each pitborn, whether you have webbed fingers and thrive in the water, large hands capable of wrestling larger foes, or some other manifestation. You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]]. If you were already trained in Athletics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
 You also gain any one common 1st-level skill feat with a prerequisite of trained in Athletics, as reflects the manifestation of your Abyssal blood.
