Wood and bark grow over your body like armor. This hardwood armor is medium armor but uses your highest armor proficiency. The wooden armor's statistics are: _AC Bonus_ +3; _Dex Cap_ +2; _Check Penalty_ –2; _Speed Penalty_ –5 feet; _Strength_ 14; _Bulk_ 1; _Group_ [[DATABASE/armorgroup/Wood|wood]]. Any bonuses, runes, and magical abilities of your actual armor are suppressed, but any runes that could apply to the hardwood armor are replicated onto it.
 When you use this impulse, you can also create a wooden shield in a free hand. You can [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] with this shield even if you don't have that feat. The hand wielding this shield counts as a free hand for using impulses. The shield decays in an instant if it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]] or leaves your grasp.
 The armor lasts for 10 minutes, and you can Dismiss this impulse. If you use this impulse again, any existing one ends.

**Level (+3)** The shield's Hardness increases by 1, its HP by 4, and its BT by 2.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Wood:**

Effects with the wood trait conjure or manipulate wood. Those that manipulate wood have no effect in an area without wood. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of wood or have a connection to magical wood.
