Your body is designed to be particularly resilient. Your chassis is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a speed penalty of –5 feet, and a Strength value of 16. You can never wear other armor or remove your chassis; however, you still don't become [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armor runes onto your chassis as normal.
**Enhancement** Your chassis becomes difficult to overcome. You gain the Chassis Deflection reaction.
