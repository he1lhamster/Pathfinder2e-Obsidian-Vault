You can use [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 Medicine check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Raise Dead|raise dead]], except it still has the [[DATABASE/condition/Wounded|wounded]] condition it had before [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]], increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.

**Healing:**

A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.
