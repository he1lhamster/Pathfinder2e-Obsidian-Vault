You hold your shield together with the power of your faith and conviction, refusing to let wood splinter and steel shatter until the day's battles are won. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your Shield Block, the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened until you repair it, preventing you from using Resolute Defender to save the same shield again until your next daily preparations.
