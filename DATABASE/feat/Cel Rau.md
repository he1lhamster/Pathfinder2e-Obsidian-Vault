You are a cel rau, child of a strigoi, one of the first vampires to walk Golarion. Your heritage ties you to the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] and grants you strange resilience to light and darkness alike. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects with the darkness, light, or shadow traits, and whenever you become [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for at least 2 rounds, you can reduce the duration by 1 round.
