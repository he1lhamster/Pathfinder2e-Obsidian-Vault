You jam a triple charge of black powder into your weapon to unleash a devastating but risky and inaccurate attack. Interact to reload, expending three doses of black powder in addition to your normal black powder or ammunition, then Strike with your firearm against a creature within the weapon's first range increment. If you roll a success, the attack is instead a critical success, but if you roll a failure, the weapon misfires. Regardless of your roll, after the attack you're [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of your next turn and [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
