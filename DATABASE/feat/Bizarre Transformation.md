The forms you take on defy belief—chimerical sights of twisted antlers or acidic drool. If your next action is to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Wild Shape|wild shape]], you can change the damage type of a single unarmed attack granted by the wild shape form to one of the following: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, poison, piercing, or slashing. The chosen attack gains the appropriate trait.

## Traits

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
