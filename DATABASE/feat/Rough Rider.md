You are especially good at riding traditional goblin mounts. You gain the [[Ride]] feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Nature]] checks to use [[Command an Animal]] on a [[Goblin Dog]] or [[Wolf]] mount. You can always select a [[Wolf]] as your animal companion, even if you would usually select an animal companion with the mount special ability, such as for a [[Champion]].
