You are especially good at riding traditional goblin mounts. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Ride|Ride]] feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] checks to use [[DATABASE/action/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] on a [[DATABASE/monster/Goblin Dog|goblin dog]] or [[DATABASE/monster/Wolf|wolf]] mount. You can always select a [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Wolf|wolf]] as your animal companion, even if you would usually select an animal companion with the mount special ability, such as for a [[DATABASE/class_/Champion|champion's steed ally]].
