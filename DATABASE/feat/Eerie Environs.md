The natural world can be scary to those not used to it—and you make it scarier still. If you're hidden from a creature, you can attempt to [[Demoralize]] it without losing your [[Hidden]] condition— imitating the sounds of strange beasts or causing the foliage to rustle menacingly. When you do so, you don't take a penalty to your check if the target doesn't understand your language.
