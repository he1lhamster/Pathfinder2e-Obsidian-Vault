Your connection to elemental wood asserts itself in the form of decay, like forgotten logs left to rot and the char that remains after a forest fire, cycles of devastation clearing away what was to make room for the next generation of life. You gain the Decompose action.
 **Decompose** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (primal, void) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Void energy seeps out of you, decaying everything within a 5-foot emanation and causing plants and foliage to age and decompose. Natural difficult terrain is destroyed, and creatures in the area with the plant or wood trait take 1d6 void damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

## Traits

**Ardande:**

Ardandes are [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Planar Scion|planar scions]] descended from [[DATABASE/monster/Kizidhar|kizidhar]] and other beings of elemental wood.

**Lineage:**

A feat with this trait indicates a character's descendance from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat. You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of these feats.
