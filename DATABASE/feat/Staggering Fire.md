---
You've learned how to fire at enemies to slow them down, allowing innocents and fellow knights alike time to escape. Make a ranged Strike with a weapon in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Bow|bow]] weapon group. On a hit, the target takes a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed until the end of its turn, or a –10-foot circumstance penalty on a critical hit.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Press:**

Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can't use one when it's not your turn, even if you use the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ready|Ready]] activity.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
