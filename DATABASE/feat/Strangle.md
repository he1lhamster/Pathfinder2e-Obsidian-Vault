<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Wrestler|Wrestler]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Wrestler Dedication|Wrestler Dedication]]
**Requirements** You have a creature [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]].

You twist and squeeze the breath out of your foe. Make an unarmed melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained. On a success, you gain a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice and the target can barely speak until the start of your next turn or until it [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]], whichever comes first. While it can barely speak, the target can't vocalize above a hoarse whisper, and it must succeed at a DC 10 flat check or lose any action that requires speech. For an action requiring speech that is also a manipulate action, like Casting a Spell with somatic and verbal components, the target just rolls a single DC 10 flat check, rather than an additional DC 5 flat check for being grabbed.
