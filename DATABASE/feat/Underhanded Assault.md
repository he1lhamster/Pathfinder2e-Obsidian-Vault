You capitalize on the distraction provided by an ally. You [[Sneak]] up to a foe adjacent to one of your allies. You can roll against the foe you're Sneaking up on, even if it's currently [[Observed]] you, as though you were [[Hidden]]. You take a –2 penalty on your [[Stealth]] check. If your Stealth check against the chosen foe succeeds, you can make a melee Strike against that foe at the end of your Sneak.
