When confronted with the unknown, you can receive knowledge beyond your own experience via written messages delivered by your hand. You spend 10 minutes seated while holding a writing utensil, using it to make small circular motions as you open your mind to the forces around you. You receive information as your hand writes on its own, guided by spirits. At the end of these 10 minutes, [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] with any [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill in which you are not trained, using your Occultism modifier instead of your modifier with that skill. The strain of this spirit channeling leaves you [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for the next 10 minutes.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Exploration:**

An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
