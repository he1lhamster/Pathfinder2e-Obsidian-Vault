The earth has taught you how to remain unyielding and firm. If you roll a success on an [[Acrobatics]] check made to [[Balance]] on uneven ground composed of earth or rock, you get a critical success instead. As long as you remain on the ground, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Shove]] or [[Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that would attempt to knock you [[Prone]]. If you're a [[Rock Dwarf]], this bonus increases to +3.
