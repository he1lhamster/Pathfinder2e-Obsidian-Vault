The earth has taught you how to remain unyielding and firm. If you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check made to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] on uneven ground composed of earth or rock, you get a critical success instead. As long as you remain on the ground, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that would attempt to knock you [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. If you're a [[DATABASE/heritage/Rock Dwarf|rock dwarf]], this bonus increases to +3.
