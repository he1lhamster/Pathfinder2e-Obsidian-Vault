---
The elemental metal in your bloodline literally courses through your veins in the form of liquid metals like mercury, rubidium, gallium, and [[DATABASE/equipment/Djezet|djezet]], giving your actions a languid fluidity. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. As these metals are largely toxic to organic life, you also gain the Toxic Touch action.
 **Toxic Touch** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (poison) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** Your most recent action was to [[DATABASE/action/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]], and you successfully moved through an enemy's space; **Effect** Make a melee unarmed Strike against the enemy whose space you moved through. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent poison damage]] and is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (or takes 2d6 persistent poison and is sickened 2 on a critical hit).
