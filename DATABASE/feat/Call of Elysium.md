The wild wonder of [[DATABASE/plane/Elysium|Elysium]] harmonizes within you, and in dire straits, you can share its benefits with your allies. Your Speed increases by 5 feet; the Speed increase from this feat isn't cumulative with any Speed increase from your ancestry feats (such as [[DATABASE/feat/Nimble Elf|Nimble Elf]]). Allies who begin their turn in combat adjacent to you gain a +5-foot status bonus to their Speed for the round.
