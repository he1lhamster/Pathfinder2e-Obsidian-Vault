With a sharp whistle or wave of your hands, you distract an opponent from the fact that one of your allies is about to attack them. Choose a target and an ally, both of whom must be within 30 feet. The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against the first Strike the ally makes on their next turn; if your ally doesn't Strike that target, the effect is lost. Depending on how you describe your distraction, this action gains either the auditory or visual trait.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

### Gang Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 159. All or Nothing|Pathfinder #159: All or Nothing]]
Street gangs in Absalom recruit amateur pickpockets, ruffians, and vandals who show promise in their specialties and operate well in tight groups.
 Rogue agents can gain access to some of the following rogue feats by successfully helping Maurrisa Jonne or Bloody Berleth eliminate their rival (see Chapter 1). Some of these feats, however, can be gained only by helping a particular side in the gang conflict.
