You can communicate with plants and fungi on a basic level and use [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on them and to make very simple [[DATABASE/action/Request|Requests]] of them. Non-creature plants and fungi typically can't fulfill most requests you might ask of them unless you have access to other magic such as [[DATABASE/spell/Speak with Plants|speak with plants]]. Because of your affiliation with the leaf order, plants and fungi have a sense that you support them, so you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your check to Make a Request of a plant or fungus using Green Empathy.
