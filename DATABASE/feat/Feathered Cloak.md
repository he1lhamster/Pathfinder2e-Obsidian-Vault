To blend in with the grounded and wingless, you fold your wings just so on your back, creating the illusion of a feathered cloak. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] a version of yourself who is not a strix.
 Additionally, your folded wings help you obscure objects on your person, providing a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]].
