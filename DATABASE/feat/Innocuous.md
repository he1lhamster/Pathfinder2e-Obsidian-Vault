Halflings have been unobtrusive assistants of larger folk for untold ages, and your people count on this assumption of innocence. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Deception]] (or another skill of your choice, if you’re already trained in Deception). If you fail a Deception check to Create a Diversion, humanoid creatures aren’t aware that you were trying to trick them unless you get a critical failure on your roll.
