---
You enter a tall and proud stance while remaining mobile, with all the grace and composure of a peafowl. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are melee Strikes with the required sword. Once per round, after you hit with a monk sword Strike, you can Step as a free action as your next action.

## Traits

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
