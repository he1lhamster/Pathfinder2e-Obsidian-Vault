You dip and spin, unleashing a wide whirlpool of water. Make an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] each creature standing on the ground in a 10-foot emanation. These attacks all count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you make all the attacks.
