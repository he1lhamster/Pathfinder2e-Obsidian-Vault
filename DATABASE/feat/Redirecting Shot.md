Seeing your ally's attack about to go astray, you fire your weapon to right its course. Discharge your firearm and roll a d20. Your ally uses this roll instead of their own, and the attack ignores bonuses the target would gain against the attack from lesser or standard cover.

## Traits

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
