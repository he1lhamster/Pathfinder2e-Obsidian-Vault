# Venom Spit <span class="item-type">Feat 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Nagaji</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]

---
You've learned the art of lobbing toxic spittle at vulnerable spots on your foes, especially the eyes. You gain a venomous spit ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 10 feet that deals 1d4 poison damage. On a critical hit, the target takes [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent poison damage]] equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Your spit doesn't have a weapon group, nor a critical specialization effect.
**Special** If you have the [[DATABASE/heritage/Hooded Nagaji|hooded nagaji]] heritage, in addition to your venomous spit's normal critical hit effect, the target is also [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the start of your next turn.

## Traits

**Nagaji:**

Nagaji are brawny humanoids with scaled skin and serpentine heads, many of whom serve or respect nagas.
