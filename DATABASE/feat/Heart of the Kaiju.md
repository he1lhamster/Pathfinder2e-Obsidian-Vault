Witnessing the might of the kaiju King Mogaru, Alru, and Toraloa up close awoke a new ferocity within you. When you transform using Monstrosity Shape, you can take on a kaiju form. When you take this feat, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage; this is the damage your breath weapon deals. You can't change this later. The battle form is Gargantuan size with the following specific abilities; the damage values already include the extra die from being a 9th-level spell.

* **Kaiju** Speed 40 feet; physical resistance 5; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws (reach 20 feet), **Damage** 3d12+20 piercing; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claws (agile, reach 20 feet), **Damage** 3d8+20 slashing;**Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (evocation, primal) Each creature in a 60-foot cone takes 15d6 damage (of your chosen damage type), with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. Once activated, your breath weapon can't be used again for 1d4 rounds.
