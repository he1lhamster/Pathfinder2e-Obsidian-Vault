**Prerequisites** trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] about a specific terrain

You've made a study of the best practices for laying ambushes in terrains you've spent time learning about, be it the best way to ambush foes or the best methods of reacting to surprise attacks in those terrains. In any combat during which an enemy rolls [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] to determine initiative, you can choose to roll initiative using a Lore check that's appropriate for the encounter's terrain, if you're trained in the appropriate Lore skill.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

### Adventuring with Jubilost

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
Jubilost provides support in battle with his alchemical bombs and elixirs, but he's just as helpful when he spends time at home. As long as he's a companion, he'll serve as a source for alchemical items of his level or lower for purchase at regular prices, but if made Helpful, he provides these resources to the PCs at cost. His studies also result in the development of two new skill feats; while Jubilost doesn't take these feats himself (ever the theoretician), once the PCs have at least 4 Influence with him, these feats and formulas become available as PC options at the appropriate level.
