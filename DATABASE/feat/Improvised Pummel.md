# Improvised Pummel <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Weapon Improviser]]
**Prerequisites** [[Weapon Improviser Dedication]]
**Requirements** You are wielding an improvised weapon.

---
You make a Strike with your wielded improvised weapon. You gain a +1 item bonus to the attack roll, and the Strike deals two weapon damage dice if it would have dealt fewer. If the attack is a critical hit, in addition to the effect of the critical hit, the improvised weapon breaks. If the item has a Hardness greater than your level, or if it's an artifact, cursed item, or other item that's difficult to break or destroy, the item doesn't break and the attack is a hit instead of a critical hit.
 At 12th level, your item bonus to the attack roll increases to +2 instead of +1, and at 16th level, the Strike deals three weapon damage dice if it would have dealt fewer, instead of two.
