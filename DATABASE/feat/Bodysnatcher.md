Your secret-stealing maggots reveal how to devour more than just the flesh and secrets of a victim; you can ingest and assume their whole physical appearance. When you [[DATABASE/feat/Ghoul Dedication|Consume Flesh]] of a creature of your size or smaller, you can assume the physical form of the creature immediately after becoming satiated or fully satiated. Using Bodysnatcher counts as creating a disguise for the [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]]. Your transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine you are a member of the ancestry or creature type into which you transformed, and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through your disguise. You do not gain the special abilities, skills, voice, memories, or other characteristics of the creature you consumed, only their physical form. Unlike [[DATABASE/monsterability/Change Shape|Change Shape]], Bodysnatcher can be used to gain the appearance of a specific individual whose flesh you've consumed. This effect lasts until you are no longer satiated and can only be used once per individual creature.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Divine:**

This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Polymorph:**

These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can't be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.
 If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Transmutation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.
