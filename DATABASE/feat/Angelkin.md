You descend from an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Angel|angel]]—a winged messenger from [[DATABASE/plane/Nirvana|Nirvana]] or one of the other celestial realms—which gives you a knack for cultures and languages. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]]. If you would automatically become trained in Society (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You know the [[DATABASE/language/Celestial|Celestial]] language, and you gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Multilingual|Multilingual]] skill feat.
