You descend from an [[Angel]]—a winged messenger from [[Nirvana]] or one of the other celestial realms—which gives you a knack for cultures and languages. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Society]]. If you would automatically become trained in Society (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You know the [[Celestial]] language, and you gain the [[Multilingual]] skill feat.

## Angelkin Leads To...
