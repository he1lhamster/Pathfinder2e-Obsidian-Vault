You trace your lineage to [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Archon|archons]]: embodiments of heavenly virtues, guardians of the seven-tiered mountain of [[DATABASE/plane/Heaven|Heaven]], and nurturers of law and virtue within mortals. Your own virtue and orderly mind protect you from foes who would turn your emotions against you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against emotion effects, and if you roll a success on a save against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead.
