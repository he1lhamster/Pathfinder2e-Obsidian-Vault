A slew of logs eject from the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]] and slam into your enemies. They roll in a 10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line. Non-magical difficult terrain on any ground the logs roll over is smashed flat; greater difficult terrain remains. Each creature in the area takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and might be moved by the logs, depending on its Reflex save against your class DC.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed out of the line in the most direct path available.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].

---
**Level (+3)** The damage increases by 1d8.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Wood:**

Effects with the wood trait conjure or manipulate wood. Those that manipulate wood have no effect in an area without wood. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of wood or have a connection to magical wood.
