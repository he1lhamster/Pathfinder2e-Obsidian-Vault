# Invigorating Mercy <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Champion</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Blessed One]]*
**Prerequisites** [[Mercy]]
* This archetype offers Invigorating Mercy at a different level than displayed here.

---
Your divine touch rejuvenates the weak and tired. When you use [[Mercy]], you can instead attempt a counteract check to remove the [[Clumsy]] or [[Enfeebled]] conditions, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC. If the condition was caused by an ongoing effect and you don't remove that effect, the condition returns at the end of your next turn.

## Archetype Use

This feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.
