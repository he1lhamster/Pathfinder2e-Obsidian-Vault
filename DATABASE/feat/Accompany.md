**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet Casts a Spell.

---
You use your performances to supplement an ally's spellcasting, providing magical energy for their spells. Attempt a [[Performance]] check, using a very high DC for the ally's level, and either spend a Focus Point (if the triggering spell is a focus spell) or expend a spell slot at least 1 level higher than the triggering spell. If you succeed at the Performance check, your ally's spell doesn't cost the Focus Point or spell slot.
