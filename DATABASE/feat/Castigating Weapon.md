The force of your deity’s castigation strengthens your body so you can strike down the wicked. After you damage a fiend using a [[Heal]] spell, your weapon or unarmed Strikes deal extra good damage to fiends equal to half the level of the _heal_ spell until the end of your next turn. This is cumulative with any good damage the weapon already deals (such as from a holy rune).
