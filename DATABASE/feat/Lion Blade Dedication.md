Your lion blade spy training helps you conceal yourself and your identity. You become trained in your choice of [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] and in Espionage [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You never take circumstance penalties for attempting to take a disguise of a different ancestry, age, and so on, as long as the disguised form is appropriate for your size.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Lion Blade archetype.
