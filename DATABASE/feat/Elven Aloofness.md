As much as you might care for them, you've come to terms with the ephemeral nature of non-elves, and it makes their threats feel less troublesome. If a non-elf rolls a failure on a check to [[DATABASE/action/Coerce|Coerce]] you using [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]], it gets a critical failure instead (and thus can't try to Coerce you again for 1 week). When a non-elf attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] you, you become temporarily immune for 1 day, instead of 10 minutes.
