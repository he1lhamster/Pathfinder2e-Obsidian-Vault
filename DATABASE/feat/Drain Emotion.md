You touch an adjacent creature and attempt to draw out its excess emotion. Attempt a counteract check against a single emotion or fear effect affecting the touched creature. If you succeed, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).
**Special** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|human]], goblin for [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblin]], etc.).

## Traits

**All Ancestries:**

A feat with this trait is available to all ancestries.

**Enchantment:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the enchantment school of magic, typically involving mind control, emotion alteration, and other mental effects.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
