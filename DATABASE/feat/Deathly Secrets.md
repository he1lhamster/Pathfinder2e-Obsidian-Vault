<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Reanimator|Reanimator]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Reanimator Dedication|Reanimator Dedication]]

---
No means of creating or ruling the undead is beyond your grasp, even those of magical traditions not your own. You learn either the [[DATABASE/spell/Eyes of the Dead|eyes of the dead]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Subjugate Undead|subjugate undead]] focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can Refocus by meditating over the earthly remains of a dead sentient creature. The rules for focus spells appear here. Focus spells granted by the reanimator archetype are from the same tradition as those used to meet the archetype's prerequisite.
**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, you learn a different spell and your focus pool increases by 1 Focus Point.
