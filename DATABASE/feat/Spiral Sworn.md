You trace a spiral in the air while intoning prayers to [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]], gaining her blessing for a time. For 3 rounds, your Strikes and spells deal additional damage against undead, creatures in possession of an imprisoned soul, or creatures you have witnessed create or command undead. You gain a status bonus to damage with your Strikes against these creatures equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Spells you cast from spell slots gain a status bonus to damage against these creatures equal to the level of the spell; this bonus applies only to spells that deal damage and don't have a duration. If your spiral is glowing, you can target a willing creature in its light. If you do, that creature gains the bonuses instead of you.
