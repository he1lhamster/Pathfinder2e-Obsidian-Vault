You always seem to bounce back from the worst. When you use [[DATABASE/feat/Charmed Life|Charmed Life]], roll the save twice (including the +2 circumstance bonus from Charmed Life) and use the better result.

## Traits

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
