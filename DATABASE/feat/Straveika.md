You descend from one of the truly ancient vampires, a nosferatu cursed to eternal life but not eternal youth. People call you straveika, or ancient-born. The vestiges of your forebear's powers of domination have left you with an understanding of how a creature's intentions change its behaviors. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] and Perception DCs against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]] to you.
