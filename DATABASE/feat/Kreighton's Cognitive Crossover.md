## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

The Society's Master of Scrolls, Kreighton Shaine (_Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide_ page 42), may be considered strange and absent-minded by his peers, but the elf venture-captain takes his duties quite seriously. Skilled in researching obscure subjects and unraveling inscrutable secrets, Kreighton teaches his students the value of an inquisitive mind.
