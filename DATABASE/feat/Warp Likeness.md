**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Frequency** once per minute
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Morph-Risen|Morph-Risen]]
**Trigger** You hit a creature with a melee Strike on your last action.

---
You channel some of your own nature through your blow, temporarily warping your target's form to resemble your own. The creature you hit must attempt a Fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target resists the effect but its form twists in the process. It's [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] until the end of its next turn.
**Failure** The target's body briefly warps to resemble yours. It's clumsy 1 until the end of its next turn and [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]].
**Critical Failure** The target's body warps to resemble yours for a significant time. It's clumsy 1 for 1 minute and sickened 2.

## Traits

**Morph:**

Effects that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait).
Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Reflection:**

A creature with this trait has the [[DATABASE/ancestry/Reflection|reflection]] versatile heritage. Reflections are beings who are copies of living people, whether through cloning, planar duplication, or another mechanism. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by reflections.

**Transmutation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.
