The shallows and tide pools have always called to you and let you pass unhindered. You ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water. In addition, if you roll a success on an [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Balance]] on a slippery or wet surface, or on an [[Athletics]] check to [[Swim]], you get a critical success instead.
