The shallows and tide pools have always called to you and let you pass unhindered. You ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water. In addition, if you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] on a slippery or wet surface, or on an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]], you get a critical success instead.
