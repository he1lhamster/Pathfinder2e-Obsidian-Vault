With patience and time, you can make bird calls, leave game trails, and ultimately influence the behavior of a certain type of animals in the region to favor and even aid you in the days to come. The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time your work requires (usually at least a day or two of downtime). While you can't directly control how you've influenced nature, you can hope for certain effects, such as easier hunts or birds falling silent whenever danger is approaching. If you're legendary in [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]], you can elicit these same adjustments to animal behavior in the area by spending only 10 minutes.

## Traits

**Downtime:**

An activity with this trait takes a day or more, and can be used only during downtime.

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
