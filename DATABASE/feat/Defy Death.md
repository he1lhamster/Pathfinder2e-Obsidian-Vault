You're exceptionally difficult to kill. The DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value, or 8 + your dying value if you have the [[Toughness]] general feat. In addition, whenever someone returns you to life using magic that would normally leave you debilitated for a week (such as [[Raise Dead]] or the [[Resurrect]] ritual), you don't suffer that condition.
