A massive sphere of rock explodes, unleashing a cataclysm of falling debris and deadly shrapnel. Its destruction falls in a 20-foot burst within 120 feet. Creatures in the area take 9d10 bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC. Those who fail are knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. For the next minute, rocks continue to fall, making the area difficult terrain and dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage to any creature that ends its turn in the area. If you use this impulse again, any previous one ends.

**Level (20th)** The initial damage is 10d10, and the area damage is 4d10.

## Traits

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
