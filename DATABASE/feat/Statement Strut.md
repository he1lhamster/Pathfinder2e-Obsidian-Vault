---
You have an eye for fashion and know how to sell attitude and confidence with your walk. You Stride up to your Speed. All enemies within 30 feet of your movement are enraptured by your performance: they must succeed at a Will saving throw or become unable to use reactions until the end of your next turn. The DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

**Visual:**

A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.
