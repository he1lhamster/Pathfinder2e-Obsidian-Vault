Your construct unleashes a broad swath of devastation by separating its limbs, deploying hidden armaments, or using a similar technique to wreak havoc. You Command your innovation. Instead of its normal actions, it Strides once, then makes a Strike against each foe within 30 feet of it with a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack rolls. The multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the construct makes all the attacks.
