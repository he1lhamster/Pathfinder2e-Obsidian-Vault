Your tongue can momentarily latch on as readily as your hands. So long as you can freely open your mouth, you do not need free hands in order to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]], [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]], or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]]. If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Long Tongue|Long Tongue]] feat, you can Disarm, Grab an Edge, and Trip with your tongue at a distance that is 5 feet beyond your normal reach.
