<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Fleshwarp</span>
**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Prerequisites** [[Cataphract Fleshwarp]]
**Access** You're from Nex

---
Nex's Fleshforges shaped you not to achieve individual greatness at arms, but rather to become a part of a legion, a modular piece integral to the combined arms stratagems of Nexian battlemages. You become trained in [[Arcana]] and [[Athletics]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills, you instead gain the trained rank in another skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[Lore]].

**Fleshwarp:**

A humanoid transformed so completely by outside forces that they are now a unique ancestry

They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
