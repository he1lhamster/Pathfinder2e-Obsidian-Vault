# Vacate Vision <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[Oozemorph]]
**Prerequisites** [[Oozemorph Dedication]]
**Trigger** You fail (but don't critically fail) a saving throw against an effect with the visual trait.

---
You cause your eyes to liquefy and run out of your eye sockets, leaving them empty. You get a success on the save against the triggering effect, but you are [[Blinded]] for the duration the effect would have had on a failure. At that time, your eyes regrow and your normal vision returns.
