**Source** [[DATABASE/source/The Slithering|The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Oozemorph|Oozemorph]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Oozemorph Dedication|Oozemorph Dedication]]
**Trigger** You fail (but don't critically fail) a saving throw against an effect with the visual trait.

---
You cause your eyes to liquefy and run out of your eye sockets, leaving them empty. You get a success on the save against the triggering effect, but you are [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for the duration the effect would have had on a failure. At that time, your eyes regrow and your normal vision returns.
