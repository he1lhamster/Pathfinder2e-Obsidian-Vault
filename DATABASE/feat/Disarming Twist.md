---
After your initial attack redirects your foe's defenses, your follow-up wrests their weapon from their grasp. Make a melee Strike with the required weapon. In addition to its other effects, this Strike gains the success and critical success effects of the [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] action. The Strike also has the following failure effect.
**Failure** The target is flat-footed until the end of your current turn.

## Archetype Use

This feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.

## Traits

**Press:**

Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can't use one when it's not your turn, even if you use the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ready|Ready]] activity.
