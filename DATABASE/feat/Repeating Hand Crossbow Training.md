You become trained in the [[DATABASE/weapon/Repeating Hand Crossbow|repeating hand crossbow]] and gain access to repeating hand crossbows and [[DATABASE/equipment/Shootist Bandolier|shootist bandoliers]]. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the repeating hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a repeating hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You can perform the [[DATABASE/feat/Drow Shootist Dedication|Shootist's Draw]] action with repeating hand crossbows.
**Special** If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Running Reload|Running Reload]] feat, you can reload a repeating hand crossbow magazine on the move. You can use Running Reload as a 3-action activity to reload a magazine into a repeating hand crossbow after you [[DATABASE/action/Stride|Stride]], [[DATABASE/action/Step|Step]], or [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]], or as a 2-action activity if you use a magazine from a shootist bandolier.
