**Source** [[Pathfinder 165. Eyes of Empty Death]]
**Archetype** [[Drow Shootist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Drow Shootist Dedication]]

---
You become trained in the [[Repeating Hand Crossbow]] and gain access to repeating hand crossbows and [[Shootist Bandolier]]. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the repeating hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a repeating hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You can perform the [[Drow Shootist Dedication]] action with repeating hand crossbows.
**Special** If you have the [[Running Reload]] feat, you can reload a repeating hand crossbow magazine on the move. You can use Running Reload as a 3-action activity to reload a magazine into a repeating hand crossbow after you [[Stride]], [[Step]], or [[Sneak]], or as a 2-action activity if you use a magazine from a shootist bandolier.
