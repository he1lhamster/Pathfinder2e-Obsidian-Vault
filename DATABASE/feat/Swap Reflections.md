You've learned how to use even your reflection to your advantage. You send your own reflection to forcibly swap places with the reflection of an enemy, pulling each of you through opposite ends and switching places. The enemy must be within 120 feet, you must both be adjacent to reflective surfaces (such as glass, mirrors, or calm water), and you must be able to see the target's reflection and have line of effect to it. The target attempts a Will save against your spell DC or class DC, whichever is higher.
**Critical Success** The spell has no effect.
**Success** You swap positions with your target or arrive adjacent to your target, whichever your target prefers. 
**Failure** You swap positions with your target or arrive adjacent to your target, whichever you prefer.
**Critical Failure** You instantaneously swap positions with your target, and the target becomes trapped in its own reflection for 1 minute. Once on each of its turns, the target can spend 1 action to attempt another Will save to escape. If the save succeeds, the effect ends early.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Conjuration:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the conjuration school of magic, typically involving summoning, creation, teleportation, or moving things from place to place.

**Extradimensional:**

This effect or item creates an extradimensional space. An extradimensional effect placed inside another extradimensional space ceases to function until it is removed.

**Incapacitation:**

An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Teleportation:**

Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.
