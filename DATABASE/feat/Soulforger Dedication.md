You can manifest the power of your spirit in combat to realize your motivations. You manifest an armor, shield, or weapon as a soulforged armament. Choose one essence power for the armament (below). Changing an essence power requires 1 week of retraining, and you can't retrain it while you have soulforged corruption.
 You can Manifest Soulforged Armament to summon your armaments in combat.
 **Manifest Soulforged Armament** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, conjuration, divine, extradimensional) **Requirements** If summoning a weapon or shield, you have the hands free to wield it; if summoning armor, you aren't wearing any armor; **Effect** You immediately wield or wear the soulforged armament bound to you.
