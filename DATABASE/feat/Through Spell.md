Spells you cast can transform briefly into vital essence, traveling harmlessly through living and undead creatures between you and your target, blocked only by solid objects. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that requires a spell attack roll, your targets don't benefit from cover provided by living or undead creatures.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
