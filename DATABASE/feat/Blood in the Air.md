**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Requirements** An enemy you've damaged with a ranged weapon during the last minute is [[Concealed]] or [[Hidden]] from you.

---
Once you've locked on to a target, little can obscure your aim. Make a ranged weapon Strike against the required target. This Strike ignores the target's concealed condition and reduces the flat check for the hidden condition from 11 to 5.
