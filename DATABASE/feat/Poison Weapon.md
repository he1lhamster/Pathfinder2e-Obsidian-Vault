# Poison Weapon <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Manipulate</span><span class="item-trait">Rogue</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Assassin]]*, [[Drow Shootist]]*, [[Poisoner]]*
**Requirements** You are wielding a piercing or slashing weapon.
* This archetype offers Poison Weapon at a different level than displayed here.

---
You apply a poison to the required weapon; if you have a free hand, you can Interact to draw a poison as part of this action. If your next attack with that weapon before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, it applies the effects of the poison, provided that poison can be delivered by contact or injury. If you critically fail the attack roll, the poison is wasted as normal.
**Special** During your daily preparations, you can prepare a number of simple injury poisons equal to your rogue level. These poisons deal 1d4 poison damage. Only you can apply these poisons properly, and they expire the next time you prepare.
