You open an incandescent third eye upon your forehead. The eye can remain open for 1 minute, and you can close it before then with a single action with the concentrate trait. It can remain open for 2 minutes if you’re a master in Arcana, or 5 minutes if you’re legendary. While the eye is open, you gain the following benefits: you gain the effects of the [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] arcane innate spell from your Arcane Sense at the start of each of your turns without needing to cast the spell; you gain darkvision; you gain a +2 status bonus to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] undetected and hidden creatures and to your Perception DC against [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] and [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]]. After your third eye closes, you are [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for an amount of time equal to how long you had it open.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
