You know that for the best disguise to work, one requires not only the right skills but also the right look—luckily you can copy both using special magical techniques. When you [[Impersonate]], you don't need a [[Disguise Kit]]; instead, simple illusions or temporary transmutations ripple over your body like mirror shards, providing the supplies that the kit ordinarily would. When you Impersonate in this way, your Impersonate activity gains the occult trait.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
