<span class="item-trait">Tiefling</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]]

---
You were raised by a tiefling or a fiendish relative, or you've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the fiendish realms. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Intimidation]] and [[Religion]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [[Lore]] skill related to the fiendish plane from which you trace your lineage (usually [[Abaddon]] Lore, [[Abyss]] Lore, or [[Hell]] Lore).

## Traits
