You were raised by a tiefling or a fiendish relative, or you've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the fiendish realms. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill related to the fiendish plane from which you trace your lineage (usually [[DATABASE/plane/Abaddon|Abaddon]] Lore, [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] Lore, or [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell]] Lore).
