---
You recover the energy of a recently disrupted spell, allowing you to cast it again as long as you do so immediately before the energy dissipates. You regain the use of a spell that was disrupted since the beginning of your last turn, but you must immediately Cast the Spell again with your next action or else you lose the spell; as normal for metamagic, this must be on the same turn that you use Recover Spell. You can change the area, targets, and other variables, including the number of actions used to Cast the Spell if the spell allows, such as when casting [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Missile|magic missile]].

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
