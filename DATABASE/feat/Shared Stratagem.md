The plans you make include your allies as well as yourself. When you hit a creature with an attack on which you substituted your attack roll due to [[DATABASE/action/Devise a Stratagem|Devising a Stratagem]], designate one ally. The creature you hit is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to that ally on the next attack the designated ally makes against that creature before the start of your next turn.
