Your unblinking gaze is so intense it can befuddle the mind of others, drawing your victims toward you even against their better judgment. You stare at a creature within 30 feet. The target must attempt a Will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** On its turn, the target must spend its first action to approach you. It can't [[DATABASE/action/Delay|Delay]] or take reactions until it has done so.
**Critical Failure** The target must use all its actions on its next turn to approach you. It can't Delay or take any reactions until it has reached a space that's adjacent to you (or as close to you as possible if it reaches an impassable barrier).

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Enchantment:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the enchantment school of magic, typically involving mind control, emotion alteration, and other mental effects.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Nagaji:**

Nagaji are brawny humanoids with scaled skin and serpentine heads, many of whom serve or respect nagas.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Visual:**

A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.
