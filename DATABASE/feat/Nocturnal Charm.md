The supernatural charm of your vampiric progenitor hangs about you, and you've learned to use it on mortals. Against humanoids (or other creatures of your type, if you're not a humanoid), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Deception]] checks to [[Lie]], and to [[Diplomacy]] checks to [[Gather Information]] and [[Make an Impression]].

## Traits
