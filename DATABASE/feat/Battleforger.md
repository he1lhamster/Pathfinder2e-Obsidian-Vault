You can sharpen weapons, polish armor, and apply special techniques to temporarily gain better effects from your armaments. By spending 1 hour working on a weapon or armor, you can grant it the effects of a _+1 potency_ rune until your next daily preparations, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls for a weapon or increasing armor’s item bonus to AC by 1. This has no effect if the weapon or armor already had a _potency_ rune.
