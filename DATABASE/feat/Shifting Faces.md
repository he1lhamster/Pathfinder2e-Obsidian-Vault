You wear many faces, even those that don't belong to you. When you [[Change Shape]] into your tailless form, you gain the effects of 3rd-level [[Illusory Disguise]] for 1 hour or until you shift back, except it's a transmutation effect rather than an illusion.

## Traits

**Kitsune:**

Shapeshifting humanoids whose true forms resemble foxes.
