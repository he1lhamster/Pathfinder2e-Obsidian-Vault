## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Psyche:**

Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.

**Teleportation:**

Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.
