---
After your service aiding armored combatants, you are practiced in helping yourself and others don heavy gear. You can attempt an [[Athletics]] or [[Lore]] check with a DC determined by the GM (but usually 15 for common armor, DC 20 for uncommon armor, and DC 25 for rare armor) to halve the time you take to don armor. You can halve an ally's time to don armor by working with them to don the armor and succeeding at an Athletics or Warfare Lore check against the same DC.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
