Your inborn magical nature lets you redirect ambient energies to fuel your spells. If your next action is to Cast a Spell of 5th level or lower that has no duration, you don’t expend the spell’s slot when you cast it.

## Traits

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
