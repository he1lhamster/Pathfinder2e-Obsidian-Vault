You can use the unusual resonance of your [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]] to grant it additional effects. Choose one cantrip from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal list. You can activate your [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]] to cast that cantrip at will. As normal, this cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. Additionally, you can Activate your [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]] with a <span class="action-icon">1</span> (envision) activation to transform it into a nondescript pin or brooch to hide your affiliation with the Pathfinder Society. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.
