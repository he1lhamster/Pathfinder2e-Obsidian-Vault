---
You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. Stride, [[Feint]] against that opponent, and then make a Strike against that foe. For your Feint, you can attempt a [[Stealth]] check instead of the [[Deception]] check that's usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard.
