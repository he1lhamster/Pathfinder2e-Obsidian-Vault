Your training has prepared you to recognize most undead on sight. You become trained in two [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skills, each about a specific type of undead, or become an expert if you were already trained. You gain the Slayer's Identification free action.
 **Slayer's Identification** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Trigger** You roll initiative and can observe a creature you know is undead; **Effect** You attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] to identify the undead creature with a +1 circumstance bonus. If you're a master in the skill you're using to Recall Knowledge, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the undead slayer archetype.
