Each day when you make your daily preparations, you can attune yourself to one element of your choice from your elemental philosophy. You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1 resistance) against damage dealt by effects with your attuned elemental trait.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Class:**

Archetypes with the class trait fundamentally diverge from your class's specialties but still fit within the theme of your class.
 You can select a class archetype only if your class meets the criteria listed in the archetype's prerequisites. Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a class's static class features in addition to any new feats they offer.
 It might be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level if it alters or replaces some of the class's initial class features. The 1st-level ability is presented much like a class feature and includes the class archetype's prerequisites and rules on how it changes your class. If you select this ability, you must take that archetype's dedication feat at 2nd level, and you proceed normally afterward. You can never have more than one class archetype.

**Dedication:**

You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.
