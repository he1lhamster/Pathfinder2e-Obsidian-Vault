You gain nourishment through photosynthesis, like trees and other green plants. You typically don't need to pay for food, though you begin to starve if you go without sunlight for 1 week. You can derive nourishment from specially formulated bottles of sunlight instead of natural sunlight, but these bottles cost 10 times as much as standard rations (4 gp per week).
