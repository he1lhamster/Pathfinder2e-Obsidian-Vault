This display emits a cascade of loud bangs or glittering trails. While you initially designed the display to captivate your audience's attention, it turns out to have a surprisingly effective use in combat, suppressing auditory or visual effects behind your magnificent display. You gain the Coughing Dragon fireworks display.
 **Coughing Dragon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Cost** 2 batches of infused reagents; **Effect** Choose either auditory or visual effects. The display gains that trait, and you attempt to counteract one or more effects within 60 feet that have this trait. On a success, the effect is suppressed until the start of your next turn, rather than ending entirely. Use your [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Fireworks Lore]] modifier as your counteract modifier, and your counteract level is equal to half your advanced alchemy level (rounded up). A coughing dragon costs 2 batches of infused reagents rather than 1, but you can increase the cost to 3 batches and spend an additional action to create an even bigger coughing dragon display that attempts to counteract both auditory and visual effects at the same time.
