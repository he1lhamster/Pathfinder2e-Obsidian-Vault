---
You draw the _[[Ursine Avenger Hood]]_ over your head and its fur over your arms, assuming an ursine form that has traits of your original form as well as that of a bear. In your ursine form, you gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage and a claws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage and has the agile trait. Both unarmed attacks are in the [[Brawling]] group. You lose the ability to speak complex sentences while transformed and can only communicate through grunts and gestures; this prevents you from using effects that require a shared or spoken language until you revert back to your non-hybrid form. You can use this action while transformed to remove the hood and return to your original form.

## Ursine Avenger Form Leads To...

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Artifact:**

Items with this trait are artifacts. These magic items can't be crafted by normal means, and they can't be damaged by normal means. Artifacts are always rare or unique.

**Morph:**

Effects that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait).
Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Transmutation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.
