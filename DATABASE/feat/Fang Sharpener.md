If you’re an irongut goblin, you gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d4 piercing damage, and if you’re a razortooth goblin, your jaws unarmed attack deals 1d8 piercing damage and loses the finesse trait. Whenever you score a critical hit with your jaws unarmed attack, your target takes 1 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent]] bleed damage per weapon damage die.
