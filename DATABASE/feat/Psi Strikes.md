<span class="item-trait">Mindshift</span><span class="item-trait">Psychic</span>
**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
**Frequency** once per turn
**Requirements** Your most recent action was to Cast a Spell or to [[Unleash Psyche]].

---
You siphon residual psychic energies from your spell into one weapon you're wielding or one of your unarmed attacks and when you unleash your mind, the energies flare to match. The attack deals an extra 1d6 force damage until the end of the current turn. If your Psyche is Unleashed, this benefit instead lasts until your psyche subsides.

## Traits

**Mindshift:**

An action with this trait can always be altered to use the raw power of your mind. When you take this action, you can choose to replace any damage it deals with mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.
