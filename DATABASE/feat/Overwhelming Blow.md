You throw your weight into a powerful attack that leaves you vulnerable. Make a melee Strike. This counts as three attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you get a critical hit. If you roll a critical hit, your attack also gains the deadly d12 trait. Whether or not you hit, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] and are [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the start of your next turn.
