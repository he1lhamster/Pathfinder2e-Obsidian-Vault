**Archetype** [[Wrestler]]

**Requirements** You have a creature [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]].

---
You bend your opponent's body or limbs into agonizing positions that make it difficult for them to maintain their grip. Make an unarmed melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained. This Strike has the following effects in addition to its usual effects.
**Critical Success** You knock one held item out of the creature's grasp. It falls to the ground in the creature's space.
**Success** You weaken your opponent's grasp on one held item. Until the start of that creature's turn, attempts to [[Disarm]] the opponent of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item.
