You firmly believe in the technique of strengthening one's life force, spiritual energies, and bodily fluids through the application of colored light. When using a [[DATABASE/equipment/Torch|torch]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Lantern|lantern]], or other artificial light source to illuminate an area of dim light or darker, you use a combination of alchemical reagents, medicinal components, and colored lenses to turn that light one of seven colors, allowing you to help an ally recover from [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent damage]]. You give that target an assisted recovery, but the target can be anywhere within the bright light of the light source instead of needing to be adjacent to you. Ambient bright light (like sunlight) drowns out your artificial illumination and prevents you from using Chromotherapy.
 The color of the light you choose determines the type of persistent damage from which you help the target recover.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Healing:**

A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
