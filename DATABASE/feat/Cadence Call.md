You call out a quick cadence, guiding your allies into a more efficient rhythm. Each willing ally within your marshal's aura is [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] until the end of their next turn, and they can use the extra action only to Stride. At the end of each ally's turn, if they used the extra action, they then become [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] until the end of their following turn.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Auditory:**

Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deaf]] targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
