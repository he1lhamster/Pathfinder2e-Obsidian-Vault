You grew up in the proud Padishah Empire, where even insults have a certain poetic wit. Reroll the triggering Diplomacy check, using the second result.

## Traits

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Human:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|human]] ancestry. Humans are a diverse array of people known for their adaptability. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by humans.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
