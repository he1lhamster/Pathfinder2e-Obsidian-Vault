A knight is nothing without their armor, and you know how to keep yours ready. You can perform a 10-minute ritual, which has the conjuration and magical traits, to divert a set of heavy armor you are wearing into an extradimensional space connected to you. While the armor is in this space, you can use a three-action activity, which has the concentrate, conjuration, and teleportation traits, to phase the armor back and instantly don it. The armor automatically phases away if you don another set of armor, if you become [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or if you die. If you are incapable of wearing the armor when it phases back, it appears in your square instead.
