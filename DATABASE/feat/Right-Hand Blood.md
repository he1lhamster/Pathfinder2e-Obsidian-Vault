It's said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that of the left side is poisonous. You can take 1 damage to feed someone blood from your right side and [[DATABASE/action/Administer First Aid|Administer First Aid]] or take 2d8 damage to [[DATABASE/action/Treat Disease|Treat Disease]] or [[DATABASE/action/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]; in either case, you don't need [[DATABASE/equipment/Healer's Tools|healer's tools]], and gain a +1 item bonus. Blood from your left side causes the check to critically fail automatically.
