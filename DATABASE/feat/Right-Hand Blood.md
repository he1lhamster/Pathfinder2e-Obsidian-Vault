**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]]

It's said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that of the left side is poisonous. You can take 1 damage to feed someone blood from your right side and [[Administer First Aid]] or take 2d8 damage to [[Treat Disease]] or [[Treat Wounds]]; in either case, you don't need [[Healer's Tools]], and gain a +1 item bonus. Blood from your left side causes the check to critically fail automatically.

## Traits
