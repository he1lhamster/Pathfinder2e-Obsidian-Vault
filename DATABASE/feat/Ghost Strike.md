Once per day, you can infuse a weapon you are carrying with magical energies that allow it to strike true against incorporeal undead. The weapon gains the effects of the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] property rune for 10 minutes.
 At 10th level, you can apply this effect to two weapons instead of one.
