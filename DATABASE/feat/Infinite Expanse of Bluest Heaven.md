---
An illusion of a limitless expanse with an impossibly blue sky makes all within feel the sensation of falling... forever. The vision appears in a 20-foot burst within 100 feet. The illusion lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. Using this impulse again ends any previous one. Each creature in the area or that later enters it must attempt a Will save against your class DC. Creatures with the air trait are immune. Any effect of the illusion ends for a creature as soon as it leaves the illusion's area or the impulse ends, and the creature then becomes temporarily immune for 1 hour.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[Off-Guard]].
**Failure** The creature is off-guard. It is [[Fleeing]] from the illusory sky but is also disoriented; any time it uses an action to attempt to flee, it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check or flee to a space that's still within the illusion. The GM determines where the creatures ends up, but the creature can't stay stationary if it's able to move.

## Traits

**Air:**

Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air with various degrees of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies.

**Illusion:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the illusion school of magic, typically involving false sensory stimuli.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Visual:**

A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.
