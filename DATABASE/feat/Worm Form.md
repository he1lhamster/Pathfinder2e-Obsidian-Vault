You take on the form of a purple worm or transform into a humanoid-worm hybrid, retaining your own head but with a worm's body, transforming into a Huge battle form. You must have enough space to expand into or the ability is lost. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the form.
 You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

* AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
* 40 temporary Hit Points.
* Darkvision.
* One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +25, and you use the listed damage. Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
* [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] modifier of +30, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:

* **Purple Worm** Speed 40 feet, burrow 30 feet, swim 20 feet; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws (deadly 2d10, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 3d10+15 piercing; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> stinger (agile, poison, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d12+15 piercing plus 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent poison]]; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> body (reach 15 feet) **Damage** 1d10+13 bludgeoning
* **Hybrid Speed** 40 feet; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> stinger (agile, poison, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d12+15 piercing plus 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent poison]]; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> body (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 1d10+13 bludgeoning; **Hybrid Caster** You retain the ability to speak, and can cast spells as long as they don't have somatic or material components.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Polymorph:**

These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can't be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.
 If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Transmutation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.
