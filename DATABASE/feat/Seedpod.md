Your body produces a nearly endless supply of hard seedpods. You gain a seedpod ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 10 feet that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage; these Strikes have the manipulate trait. On a critical hit, a seedpod bursts, issuing forth a tangle of vegetation that imposes a –10-foot circumstance penalty on the target's Speed for 1 round. Seedpods do not add critical specialization effects.
