Through a combination of careful manipulation and precise breath control, you can deploy inhaled toxins precisely. When you activate an inhaled poison, you can cause it to fill a 20-foot line that’s 5 feet tall rather than a 10-foot cube. You gain a +3 status bonus to saving throws against inhaled poisons that you activate.

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

### Katapesh Poisoners

Famous not only for its pesh cash crop and the host of medicinal plants that grow naturally in the nearby desert, but also for the consistent demand for efficient toxins, Katapesh has developed its own specialized poisons and toxic techniques. The city's infamous Poison Maker's Guild is the source of many of these concoctions as well as secret techniques for using them, though unscrupulous Katapeshi bodyguards, thieves, and assassins all know at least one poison recipe or a unique means of inflicting such toxins.
