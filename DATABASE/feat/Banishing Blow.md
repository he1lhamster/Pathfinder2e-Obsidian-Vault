**Prerequisites** [[Fiendsbane Oath]]
**Trigger** You use your champion's reaction, triggered by a fiend within your reach.

---
The erratic teleportation magic you experienced in the Kortos Mounts has taught you a few tricks. You attempt an [[Athletics]] check to [[Shove]] the fiend that triggered your champion's reaction; on a success, the target can't teleport or summon creatures for 1 minute. On a critical success, the target is also [[Stunned]] and can't teleport or summon creatures for 1 hour, and if you are on your home plane and the target is a fiend of level 18 or lower from another plane, it is also banished to its home plane. Your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this attack.

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
