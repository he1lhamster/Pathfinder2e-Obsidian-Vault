Stone encases you like armor. The stone armor is medium armor but uses your highest armor proficiency. The stone armor's statistics are: _AC Bonus_ +4; Dex Cap +1; _Check Penalty_ –2; _Speed Penalty_ –10 feet; _Strength_ 16; _Bulk_ 1; _Group_ [[DATABASE/armorgroup/Plate|plate]]. You gain its armor specialization effect. Any bonuses, runes, and magical abilities of your actual armor are suppressed, but any runes that could apply to the stone armor are replicated onto it. The stone armor lasts for 10 minutes, and you can Dismiss this impulse. If you use this impulse again, any existing one ends.

**Level (3rd)** The armor becomes heavy armor. Its AC Bonus becomes +5, and it gains the bulwark armor trait.

## Traits

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
