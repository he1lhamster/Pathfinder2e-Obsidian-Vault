---
Your banner makes it harder for your foes to push your allies around and encourages your allies to protect the innocent. Allies benefiting from your Cavalier's Banner feat also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]], [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]], [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]], and [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]]. Each benefited ally also gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls against any creature that has dealt damage to an innocent of a lower level than that ally within the last round; summoned creatures, companions, or any creatures you or your allies put into danger on purpose to attempt to gain this bonus don't count.
