---
You can summon a harmless but impressive elemental display. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]]. If you would automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. When you [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a foe, if you choose to Demoralize via an elemental display, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language.

## Traits

**Suli:**

Sulis are planar scions descended from [[DATABASE/monster/Janni|jann]].
