**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Archetype** [[Lich]]
**Prerequisites** [[Lich Dedication]]; legendary in [[Crafting]]

---
Inspired by the degenerate [[Demilich]] your kind sometimes devolves into, you've embedded a gem into your brow, fusing it to your necrotic flesh. This gem has been specially calibrated to hold one of the following spells: [[Repulsion]], [[Scrying]], or [[True Seeing]]. You must decide which spell your gem contains when you take this feat; changing the spell requires retraining the feat. Once per day, you can drain the gem's magical energy to Cast the Spell without spending a spell slot.
 At 18th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 7th level. At 20th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 8th level; regardless of which spell you chose, you can instead drain the gem's magical energy to cast an 8th-level [[Spell Turning]] without spending a spell slot.
