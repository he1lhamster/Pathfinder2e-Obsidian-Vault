* This archetype offers Read Disaster at a different level than displayed here.

---
You spend 10 minutes and open yourself to the divine mysteries of the world, peering into the most sinister portents of the future. You gain the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Augury|augury]], except you learn only about the dangers ahead; any results of “weal” are instead “nothing,” and results of “weal and woe” are instead “woe.” If you are legendary in [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]], you take only 1 minute to Read Disaster.
