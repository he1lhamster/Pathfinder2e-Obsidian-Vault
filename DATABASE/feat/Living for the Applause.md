Nothing can stop you as long as you have an audience cheering you on. The attention reinvigorates you and keeps you from being knocked out. You remain at 1 Hit Point, and your [[DATABASE/condition/Wounded|wounded]] condition increases by 1.
 In addition, attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, the crowd erupts in applause and cheers at your comeback, much to the dismay of your enemies. Concern for the crowd's reaction should your opponent deliver a finishing blow gives you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, you don't expend your daily use of Living for the Applause and can use the reaction an additional time on the same day.
