You open a connection to your kinetic gate, large enough for a torch flame to flow. You create a magical, [[DATABASE/equipment/Torch|torch]]-like flame within 120 feet in any color you choose. It's as bright and hot as a torch. You can have it orbit a target willing creature or emit from a target object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature. If you create a flame on a weapon, you still need to use it as an improvised weapon to attack with the flame, just as with a torch.
 The flame has an unlimited duration. You can have a maximum number of Eternal Torches equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can Dismiss each torch individually.

**Level (8th)** All your torches—even ones you already created— shed bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet).

## Traits

**Fire:**

Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Light:**

Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
