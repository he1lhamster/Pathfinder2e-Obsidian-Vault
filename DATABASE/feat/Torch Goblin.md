You’ve spent enough time on fire that you know how to use it to your advantage. You can light yourself thoroughly on fire with a held [[Torch]], a bottle of [[Alchemist's Fire]], or a similar incendiary, dealing yourself 1d6 persistent fire damage. As long as you are suffering persistent fire damage, all your melee attacks against adjacent creatures deal an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die. Any creature that successfully [[Grapple]], [[Shove]], or [[Trip]] you takes 1d6 fire damage; if it uses a weapon for that action, the weapon takes the damage instead. You must still attempt the flat check to remove the persistent fire damage each round, as normal.
