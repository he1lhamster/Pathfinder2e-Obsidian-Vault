You conduct the damage through your body, taking damage as normal (if applicable) and redirecting it at one target within 10 feet that you can see. The creature must make a Fortitude save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, they take the electrical damage; on a success, they take half damage.
