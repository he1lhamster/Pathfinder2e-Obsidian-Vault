You've found a way to use a hodgepodge combination of devices to enhance your visual abilities in every situation. You gain darkvision and low-light vision, and you can see [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] creatures and objects as translucent shapes, though these shapes are indistinct enough to be [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] to you.
 If an effect would give you the [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] condition, the effect must attempt a counteract check against your class DC, with your counteract level equaling half your level, rounded up. On a failed counteract check, you aren't blinded—your various devices are able to compensate.
