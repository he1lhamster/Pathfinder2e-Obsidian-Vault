---
You attempt to cast a malevolent entity out of the creature or object it's possessing. Roll a counteract check against the possession effect; you must be within 30 feet of the possessed creature or object to do so. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up, and your counteract modifier is your [[Occultism]] modifier, [[Religion]] modifier, or spell DC – 10, whichever is highest. If you succeed, the entity is driven out and can't attempt to possess that creature or object for 1 week. If you fail, the possessing creature is immune to your Cast Out for a year and a day.
