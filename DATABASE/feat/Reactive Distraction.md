---
You reactively switch with your decoy to foil your foe. You use Perfection Distraction, even if you were observed, as long as you end the movement of your Sneak while concealed or in a location with cover or greater cover. Your decoy is targeted by the attack or effect instead of you. In the case of an area effect, if your Sneak doesn’t move you out of the area, both you and the decoy are targeted by the effect.
