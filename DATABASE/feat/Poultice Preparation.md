# Poultice Preparation <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>

When you create an herbal elixir, you can prepare it as a poultice instead. A poultice gains the oil trait (but remains alchemical, not magical) and loses the elixir and ingested traits. You can apply a poultice by Interacting with one hand. When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item's normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent acid, bleed, or fire damage]], with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.
