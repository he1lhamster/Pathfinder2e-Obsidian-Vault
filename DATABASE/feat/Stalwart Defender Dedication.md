**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Highhelm|Highhelm]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Stalwart Defender|Stalwart Defender]]
**Prerequisites** trained in light armor
**Access** You are a [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarf]] or have undergone defender training in a dwarven settlement such as Highhelm.

---
You have completed your initial training in the ways of a stalwart defender. You gain the Tenacious Stance action. 
 **Tenacious Stance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (stance) **Requirements** You are wearing armor; **Effect** You steady yourself, as tough and immutable as stone. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level (minimum 1) and a +2 circumstance bonus to DCs against being [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shoved]] and [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Tripped]]. However, you no longer negate your armor check penalty or Speed penalty for having a high Strength while in this stance. After you leave Tenacious Stance, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from the stance, and you become temporarily immune to gaining temporary Hit Points from Tenacious Stance for 1 minute.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you take two other feats from the stalwart defender archetype.
