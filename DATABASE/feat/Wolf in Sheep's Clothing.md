With a bit of hide, some antlers, and some cast-off fur, you can create a disguise that will fool even an experienced hunter. You can [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] creatures with the animal, beast, or plant traits, so long as they are either the same size or one size larger than you and have a body shape that conforms at least vaguely to your own (in other words, a typical humanoid could Impersonate a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Bear|bear]] or an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Arboreal|arboreal]], but not a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Horse|horse]], [[DATABASE/monster/Giant Scorpion|giant scorpion]], or [[DATABASE/monster/Assassin Vine|assassin vine]]). Impersonating a larger creature doesn't change your actual size.
