With a bit of hide, some antlers, and some cast-off fur, you can create a disguise that will fool even an experienced hunter. You can [[Impersonate]] creatures with the animal, beast, or plant traits, so long as they are either the same size or one size larger than you and have a body shape that conforms at least vaguely to your own (in other words, a typical humanoid could Impersonate a [[Bear]] or an [[Arboreal]], but not a [[Horse]], [[Giant Scorpion]], or [[Assassin Vine]]). Impersonating a larger creature doesn't change your actual size.
