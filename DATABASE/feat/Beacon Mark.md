When you cast _sigil_, you can modify the spell to add the following heightened entry.
 **Heightened (4th)** You attune yourself to the marked target. While the spell lasts, you can spend a single action, which has the concentrate, detection, and divination traits, to attempt to locate the target, learning the direction to the target as long as you are within 1 mile of it. If the target is a creature or a creature is in possession of the target object, the creature can attempt a Will saving throw against your spell DC. If it succeeds, your attempt to locate the target fails and you can't attempt this again for 1 day. You can only have a single target marked with a _sigil_ modified in this way. If you Cast this Spell again on a second target, the _sigil_ spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.
