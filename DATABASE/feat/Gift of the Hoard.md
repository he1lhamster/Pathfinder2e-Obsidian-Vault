In pleasing the cravings of a mighty dragon, they have deigned to impart some of their magical essence into your body. Your eyes begin to glow and change color while your limbs and neck grow a veneer of scales, all the same color as the associated dragon, accompanied by a near-insatiable desire to amass a hoard of your own. You gain the [[DATABASE/spell/Dragon Breath|dragon breath]] sorcerer bloodline spell, emulating the breath of the associated dragon, and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. If you already have a focus pool, increase your number of Focus Points by 1. You [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] by counting and arranging your treasure.

## Traits

**Aftermath:**

This trait describes feats that represent special abilities gained after exposure to the weird and deadly.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
 Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Transmutation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.
