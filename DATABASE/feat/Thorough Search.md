You take your time searching to ensure you find everything. When [[DATABASE/action/Search|Searching]], you can take twice as long to search. Normally this means you Search at up to one quarter of your Speed, to a maximum of 150 feet per minute to check everything, or 75 feet per minute to check everything before you walk into it. If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]].
