You can jam the workings of a trap to delay its effects. Attempt a Thievery check to Disable a Device on the trap; the DC to do so is increased by 5, and the effects are as follows.
**Critical Success** You prevent the trap from being triggered, or you delay the activation until the start or end of your next turn (your choice).
**Success** You prevent the trap from being triggered, or you delay the activation until the end of your next turn (whichever is worse for you; GM’s choice).
**Failure** No effect.
**Critical Failure** You’re flat-footed until the start of your next turn.
