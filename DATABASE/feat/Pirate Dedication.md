As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to plunder. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Sailing Lore]], or become an expert in it if you were already trained. You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground caused by a ship's movement. Additionally, you gain the Boarding Assault action.
**Boarding Assault** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (Flourish) Either Stride twice or attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check (DC determined by the GM, but usually DC 20) to swing on a rope up to twice your Speed. If you boarded or disembarked from a boat or similar vehicle during this movement, you can make a melee Strike that deals one additional weapon damage die.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the pirate archetype.
