**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Archetype** [[Elementalist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Elementalist Dedication]]; wood is in your elemental philosophy

---
You enhance your spell with elemental wood, causing your magic to expand and grow beyond its original limitations. If the next action you use this turn is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that affects an area, expand the area of the spell. For bursts, expand the radius by 5 feet; for cones, expand the cone by 10 feet; and for lines, expand the length by 15 feet. The spell gains the wood trait.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Spellshape:**

Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a spellshape action directly before casting the spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than casting a spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself.
