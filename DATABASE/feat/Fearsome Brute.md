Fear makes your foes weak and more vulnerable to your attacks. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage rolls for Strikes against [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] creatures. The bonus is equal to double the target's frightened value.
 If you have master proficiency in [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]], increase the bonus to triple the target's frightened value.
