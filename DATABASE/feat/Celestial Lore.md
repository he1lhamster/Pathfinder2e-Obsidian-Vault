You were raised with an aasimar or celestial relative, or you've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the celestial realms. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill related to the celestial realm from which you trace your lineage (usually [[DATABASE/plane/Elysium|Elysium]] Lore, [[DATABASE/plane/Heaven|Heaven]] Lore, or [[DATABASE/plane/Nirvana|Nirvana]] Lore).
