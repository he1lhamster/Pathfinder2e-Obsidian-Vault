# Celestial Lore <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Aasimar</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]]

---
You were raised with an aasimar or celestial relative, or you've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the celestial realms. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Diplomacy]] and [[Religion]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [[Lore]] skill related to the celestial realm from which you trace your lineage (usually [[Elysium]] Lore, [[Heaven]] Lore, or [[Nirvana]] Lore).

## Traits
