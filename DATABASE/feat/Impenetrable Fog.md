Fog condenses in a chaotic, swirling pattern, thick enough that it seems to push back against you. You call forth a fog bank in a 10-foot burst within 120 feet. All creatures in the fog are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and all creatures outside the fog become concealed to creatures within it. The fog is so magically dense it impedes movement, making the area difficult terrain. The fog lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute.

**Level (+3)** You can make the radius of the burst larger. Increase its maximum size by 5 feet.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Water:**

Effects with the water trait either manipulate or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a magical connection to the element. Planes with this trait are mostly liquid, perhaps with pockets of breathable air.
