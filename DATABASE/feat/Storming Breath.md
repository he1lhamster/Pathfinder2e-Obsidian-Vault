You spit out a freezing breath or sonic scream. You deal 4d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage for every level you have beyond 6th, to all creatures in a 30-foot cone, with a basic Reflex save.
**Awakening** Your blast powerfully batters your foes. A creature that critically fails its save is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
**Awakening** The kickback of your blast helps you make a speedy escape. When you use this ability, you [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]] backward 15 feet in a straight line directly opposite your blast. This movement doesn't trigger reactions based on movement.

## Traits

**Deviant:**

This trait describes strange supernatural or paranormal abilities.

**Evocation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
 Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
