---
Your colossal might marks you as a behemoth, the pride of Nex's Fleshforges, and the heaviest ordnance is a child's toy in your monumental grasp. You're a dreadnought, a living siege weapon, albeit one that wields other siege weapons in battle as your endoskeleton and flesh toughens. You gain the [[Hefty Hauler]] skill feat, and your maximum Bulk limit further increases by 3, for a total of 2 to your [[Encumbered]] limit and 5 to your maximum limit.
