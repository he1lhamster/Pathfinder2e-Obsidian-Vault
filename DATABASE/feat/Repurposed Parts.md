You are familiar with the fittings and cogwheels of your snares and can repurpose parts from prepared quick-deploy snares to assemble a new creation on the fly. Using two of the snares you prepared for quick deployment during daily preparations, you can quickly deploy a different snare that you know how to [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]], even if you didn't prepare that snare during your daily preparations.
