Your cunning knowledge grants you the ability to notice the emotional echo of a soul that passed on, leaving a haunt in its wake. Even when you aren't [[DATABASE/action/Search|Searching]] while in exploration mode, the GM rolls a secret check for you to notice haunts that usually require you to be Searching.
 You can disable haunts that require master proficiency in a skill as long as you're at least trained in the skill. If you have master proficiency in the skill, you can disable haunts that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead.
