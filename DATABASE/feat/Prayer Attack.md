**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Red Mantis Assassin|Red Mantis Assassin]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Red Mantis Assassin Dedication|Red Mantis Assassin Dedication]]
**Requirements** You are wielding a [[DATABASE/weapon/Sawtooth Saber|sawtooth saber]] in each hand.

---
You've mastered the signature assassination style of the Red Mantis. Attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Feint|Feint]] an enemy within 30 feet. If your Feint is successful, when you use Prayer Attack on subsequent turns you automatically make the target [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against your melee attacks for that turn without rolling a check to Feint, so as long as you remain visible to the target and the target remains within 30 feet of you. If you use your Prayer Attack against a different target, you must attempt to Feint the target normally.
 When you use Prayer Attack, your next successful Strike with a sawtooth saber that turn deals 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] to the target.

The Red Mantis Assassin archetype appears on page 71 of the _Lost Omens World Guide_. Of the additional options below, only Prayer Attack is available freely to Red Mantis assassins without prior permission from the Blood Mistress. Those who dare learn these rare abilities without her permission run the risk of being cast out of the society and hunted down by their former allies. In theory, a daring infiltration of the Crimson Citadel could allow one to study hidden texts and learn these techniques, but the chambers within and below this fortress are among the most dangerous in the region, so such an attempt should not be made lightly!
