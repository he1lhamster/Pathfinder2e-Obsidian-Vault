You take advantage of teleportation to better hide your position. When you cast [[Dimensional Assault]], you're affected by an [[Invisibility]] spell at the end of the teleport. You can choose not to make the Strike that is normally part of _dimensional assault_. If you do make the Strike, your invisibility ends after the Strike, as normal for _invisibility_.
