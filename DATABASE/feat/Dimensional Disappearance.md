You take advantage of teleportation to better hide your position. When you cast [[DATABASE/spell/Dimensional Assault|dimensional assault]], you're affected by an [[DATABASE/spell/Invisibility|invisibility]] spell at the end of the teleport. You can choose not to make the Strike that is normally part of _dimensional assault_. If you do make the Strike, your invisibility ends after the Strike, as normal for _invisibility_.
