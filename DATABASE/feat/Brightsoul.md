The fire inside you asserts itself as beaming, radiant light. Your body is naturally luminescent, glowing with the effects of a primal [[Light]] cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. The light is involuntary and constant; if counteracted, it returns in 1d4 rounds. You suffer a –2 circumstance penalty on [[Stealth]] checks to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]] and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against light effects and effects that inflict the [[Blinded]] or [[Dazzled]] conditions.

## Traits

**Ifrit:**

**Lineage:**

A feat with this trait indicates a character's descendance from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat. You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of these feats.
