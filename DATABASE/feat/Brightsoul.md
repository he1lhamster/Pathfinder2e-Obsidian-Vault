The fire inside you asserts itself as beaming, radiant light. Your body is naturally luminescent, glowing with the effects of a primal [[DATABASE/spell/Light|light]] cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. The light is involuntary and constant; if counteracted, it returns in 1d4 rounds. You suffer a –2 circumstance penalty on [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] or [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]] and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against light effects and effects that inflict the [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] conditions.
