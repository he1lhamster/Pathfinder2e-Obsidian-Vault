The fey influence on your form and features grows even more powerful and notable. You gain one of the following features and abilities; this must be the same animal or fey type as you chose for Fey Influence.

* **Anteater** You become an expert in primal DCs and spell attack rolls. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Slow|slow]] as an innate primal spell once per day.
* **Cat Sith** You laugh off the outraged curses of those you have tricked or wronged. Whenever a creature targets you with a misfortune effect, make a DC 13 flat check. On a success, you are unaffected.
* **Cursed Bluebird** You have enough control over your curse to turn a bane into a minor blessing. Once per day, you can temporarily transform yourself or an ally into a blue bird, as a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Pest Form|pest form]] (bird only) targeting one willing creature.
* **Dryad** Your hair becomes intermixed with delicate but razor-edged leaves that move as you command. You gain a leaves ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage. Your leaves are in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Dart|dart]] weapon group and have the magical and unarmed traits.
* **Faun** You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Charm|charm]], [[DATABASE/spell/Sleep|sleep]], and [[DATABASE/spell/Triple Time|triple time]] as innate primal spells once per day each. Whenever you cast one of these spells, you can Step or Stride as part of the activity.
* **Gremlin** You become an expert in primal DCs and spell attack rolls. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Mad Monkeys|mad monkeys]] as an innate primal spell once per day.
* **Monarch** Once per day, you gain the ability to manifest a pair of exquisite butterfly wings. These wings remain for 10 minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed while you've manifested your wings.
* **Unicorn** You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]], or an expert if you were already trained. You gain a +2 status bonus to saves against poison and charm effects.

**Special** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|human]], goblin for [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblin]], etc.).

## Traits

**All Ancestries:**

A feat with this trait is available to all ancestries.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
