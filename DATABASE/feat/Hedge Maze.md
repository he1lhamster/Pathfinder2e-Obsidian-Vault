You sculpt a manicured maze of hedges. You create a [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Shrubs|wall of shrubs]] in a square 30 feet on a side, with 15-foot-high walls. You can place up to four more walls inside, each 10 feet wide and 15 feet high. The hedge lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute.
 You can spend 10 minutes using this impulse as an exploration activity to instead create a cozy cabin with hedges for walls. It lasts for 12 hours, but ends if you use the impulse again.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Plant:**

Vegetable creatures have the plant trait. They are distinct from normal plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Wood:**

Effects with the wood trait conjure or manipulate wood. Those that manipulate wood have no effect in an area without wood. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of wood or have a connection to magical wood.
