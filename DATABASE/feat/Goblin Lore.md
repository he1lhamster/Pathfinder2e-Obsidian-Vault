You've picked up skills and tales from your goblin community. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/domain/Nature Domain|Nature]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Goblin Lore]].
