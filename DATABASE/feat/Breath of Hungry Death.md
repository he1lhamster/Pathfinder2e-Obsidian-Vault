You have uncovered occult mysteries that allow you to unleash the devastating hunger of Kabriri upon your foes with a single exhalation, releasing a massive cloud of flesh-eating gas that glows with a sickly green light. You deal 7d6 acid and 7d6 negative damage to all creatures within a 30-foot cone (basic Reflex save with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). A creature that gets a critical failure on this Reflex save is also [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save becomes temporarily immune to Breath of Hungry Death for 24 hours. 
 When a creature is killed using Breath of Hungry Death, its body is reduced to a smoldering pile of ash wafting with necrotic fumes. You can use a reaction to immediately inhale these fumes and become satiated or fully satiated as if you had used [[DATABASE/feat/Ghoul Dedication|Consume Flesh]].

## Traits

**Acid:**

Effects with this trait deal acid damage. Creatures with this trait have a magical connection to acid.

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Divine:**

This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Incapacitation:**

An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.

**Necromancy:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
