A packed cloud of thundering boulders descends from the sky, beating down everyone in its path. The rain of stone falls in a cylinder 20 feet in diameter and 80 feet high, and the bottom must be within 120 feet of you. Each creature in the area takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and might be pushed downward, depending on its Reflex save against your class DC.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed downward 40 feet without taking falling damage. If it reaches the bottom of the cylinder or the ground, the push ends. If the creature is pushed to the ground, it can't [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]], [[DATABASE/spell/Levitate|levitate]], or otherwise leave the ground for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but double damage and the distance the creature is pushed is 80 feet.

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.

## Traits

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
