When you put your mind to slipping out of sight, you disappear completely. You become [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] for 1 minute, even if you use a hostile action. Not even [[DATABASE/spell/Glitterdust|glitterdust]], [[DATABASE/spell/See Invisibility|see invisibility]], or similar effects can reveal you, though creatures can still use the [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] action to locate you as normal.
