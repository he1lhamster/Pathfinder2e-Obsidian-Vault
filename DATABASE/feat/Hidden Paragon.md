When you put your mind to slipping out of sight, you disappear completely. You become [[Invisible]] for 1 minute, even if you use a hostile action. Not even [[Glitterdust]], [[See Invisibility]], or similar effects can reveal you, though creatures can still use the [[Seek]] action to locate you as normal.
