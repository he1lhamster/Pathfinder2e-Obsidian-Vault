You call forth positive energy from within to help you destroy undead. Your weapon and unarmed Strikes gain the effects of a [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|disrupting]] property rune until the start of your next turn.
 If you're 14th level or higher, your Strikes instead gain the effects of a _greater disrupting_ property rune. The DC for the rune's effect is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
