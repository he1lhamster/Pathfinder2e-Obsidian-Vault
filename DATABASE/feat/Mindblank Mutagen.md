With a minor adjustment of ratios in the formula for your [[DATABASE/equipment/Serene Mutagen|serene mutagen]], you gain mental protections. When you’re affected by a serene mutagen, detection, revelation, and scrying effects of 9th level or lower detect nothing from you or your possessions and auras. For instance, [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on you.
