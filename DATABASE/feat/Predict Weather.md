By observing often subtle indicators in the environment, you may try to predict the day's weather. Spend 10 minutes outdoors then attempt a DC 20 Survival check. (This check is reduced to DC 15 if you have a commanding view of the region, but increases to 30 if conditions are poor, such as attempting to predict weather with impaired visibility). 
Once you make an attempt to Predict the Weather, you cannot attempt to do so again for 24 hours.
**Critical Success** You accurately predict the day's precipitation, temperature, and wind. You learn if a weather event will occur in the region within the next 24 hours, and if so, what the event is and approximately when it will occur. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks made to prepare for this weather event.
**Success** You accurately predict the day's precipitation, temperature, and wind. You learn if a weather event will occur in the region during the next 24 hours, but not what that event will be or when it will take place. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks made to prepare for this weather event.
**Critical Failure** You come to a dramatically wrong conclusion. The GM provides information to you as though you had received a critical success, including the specifics of a weather event that will not occur that day (instead, a different event—or no event—may occur).

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Secret:**

The GM rolls the check for this ability in secret.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
