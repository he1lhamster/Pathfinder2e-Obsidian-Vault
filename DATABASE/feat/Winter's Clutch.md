Gleaming flakes of chilling snow fall in a 10-foot burst within 60 feet. Each creature in the area takes 2d4 cold damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The ground in the area is covered in a snow drift, which is difficult terrain. Each square of the drift lasts until it melts, either naturally or until fire damage is dealt in that square.

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d4.

## Traits

**Cold:**

Effects with this trait deal cold damage. Creatures with this trait have a connection to magical cold.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Water:**

Effects with the water trait either manipulate or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a magical connection to the element. Planes with this trait are mostly liquid, perhaps with pockets of breathable air.
