You turn an element into its purest form. Choose one of your kinetic elements and target up to 1 cubic foot of that element within 30 feet. (One cubic foot of liquid is roughly 8 gallons.) You remove toxins and pollutants from the element as well as anything intruding into the element, such as plant roots in soil. This can't change the grade of a material, alter the form of a manufactured object, or change the structural integrity of the element. If the purification would remove an alchemical or magical pollutant (such as a poison or curse), Purify Element attempts to counteract that impurity, using your class DC — 10 for the counteract check. If it fails to counteract a particular impurity, any further attempt you make to counteract that impurity with Purify Element fails as well.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
