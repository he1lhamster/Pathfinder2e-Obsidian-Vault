You lash out confusingly with what seems to be a weak move but instead allows you to unleash a dangerous flurry of blows upon your unsuspecting foe. When you use [[Flurry of Blows]], you can attempt a check to [[Feint]] as a free action just before the first Strike. On a success, instead of making the target [[Flat-Footed]] against your next attack, they become flat-footed against both attacks from the Flurry of Blows.
