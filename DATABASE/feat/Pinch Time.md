One of your parents has a human life span and another an elven life span, with your own somewhere between. As a result, you have an unusual perspective on time, which you've learned to manifest to aid yourself in moments of stress. You gain [[DATABASE/spell/Haste|haste]] as a 3rd-level arcane innate spell, though you can target only yourself. You can Cast this Spell once per day.
