**Trigger** A spell you cast has no effect because you critically failed all your spell attack rolls or because all targets critically succeeded at their saving throws.

You see your spell fail to take hold to disastrous end, then snap back to reality—it was all a precognition, and you know to try a different spell. Your spell is expended, but you can Cast a Spell that requires the same number of actions as the triggering spell or fewer to cast. The second spell must be a different spell than the first.

## Traits

**Divination:**

The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.
