**Requirements** You are wielding a melee weapon that deals piercing damage.

---
You impale your enemy and hold them in place with your weapon. Make a melee Strike with the required weapon. If the Strike hits and deals damage, your target is [[Grabbed]] until they successfully [[Escape]], you attack with the required weapon, or you Release the required weapon, whichever comes first. When the target is no longer grabbed, they take [[Persistent Damage]] equal to the number of weapon damage dice.
