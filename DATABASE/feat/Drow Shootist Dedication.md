Every chance you get, you practice with the hand crossbow to increase your draw speed and accuracy. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the [[DATABASE/weapon/Hand Crossbow|hand crossbow]]. If you're at least an expert in a hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You also gain the Shootist's Draw action.
 **Shootist's Draw** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You [[DATABASE/action/Interact|Interact]] to draw a hand crossbow and [[DATABASE/action/Strike|Strike]] with it, or you Strike with a loaded hand crossbow you're already holding and then Interact to stow it.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the drow shootist archetype.
