Your tricks discombobulate your opponent, leaving spots in their vision from the bright flash of your gunshot reflected straight into their eyes (or other visual organs). Attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check against the target creature's Will DC and make a ranged firearm Strike against that target. If the Strike deals damage to the target creature and you succeed at the Performance check, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round.
