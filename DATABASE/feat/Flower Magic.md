Certain magics in the world flow easily through your sap. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Barkskin|barkskin]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Tree Shape|tree shape]] as 2nd-level arcane innate spells once per day each. A _tree shape_ spell you cast this way transforms you into a Large flowering plant like a rosebush or lilac bush instead of a tree.

## Traits
