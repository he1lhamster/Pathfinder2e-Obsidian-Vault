You've learned how to read the natural auras of other living creatures. To do this, you must focus on a single living target without blinking for 1 minute. You can do this while performing some other minor task—such as making conversation to distract from your intentions—but you can't blink or otherwise lose your concentration. You can then perceive any or all of the following information.

* The target's current apparent attitude toward you ([[DATABASE/condition/Friendly|friendly]], [[DATABASE/condition/Indifferent|indifferent]], and so on).
* The target's current apparent emotional state.
* A general assessment of the target's physical health, such as what conditions or afflictions it has. You might need to succeed at an Occultism check against the affliction or condition's DC to detect the presence of a specifically hidden or subtle condition or affliction.

In addition, the GM rolls a secret Occultism check for you against the target's [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] DC. If your result exceeds your target's, you can identify if they're being deceptive in some way (such as expressing a false attitude toward you or faking an emotional state). This doesn't allow you to automatically identify the exact nature of that deception, only to tell the outward appearance is false.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Exploration:**

An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Secret:**

The GM rolls the check for this ability in secret.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
