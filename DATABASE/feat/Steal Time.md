You reach into another creature's timeline and attempt to alter their flow of time. Select a creature within 30 feet. That creature attempts a Fortitude saving throw against your chronoskimmer DC. The creature takes the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Slow|slow]] based on the result of its saving throw.
