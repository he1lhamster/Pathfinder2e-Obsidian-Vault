You're used to fighting and hiding in a haze of smoke and flame. You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] creature if that creature is concealed only by smoke. When you are concealed or [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] in smoke, increase the DC of the flat check to target you to 6 if you're concealed or 12 if you're hidden.
