**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 156. The Apocalypse Prophet|Pathfinder #156: The Apocalypse Prophet]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/class_/Cleric|healing font]]
**Trigger** Any ally within 30 feet that you can heal with your _heal_ spell would take damage from an attack or effect from a source you can observe.
**Requirements** You have a [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] spell prepared and you aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to the source of the damage.

---
You can manipulate the same energies that the _aeon orbs_ use to sustain life. You cast _heal_ on the triggering target. Instead of its normal effects, the _heal_ spell reduces the triggering damage by an amount equal to the Hit Points a 1-action _heal_ spell of that level would have recovered. As usual, if this reduces the damage to 0, it might also remove additional effects of the triggering attack, such as injury poisons.

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
