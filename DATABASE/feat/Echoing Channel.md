When you pull forth positive or negative energy, you also create a smaller pocket of that energy. If the next action you use is to cast a 2-action [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] to heal or damage a single creature, choose one additional creature adjacent to either you or the target. Target that creature with a 1-action version of the same spell. This spell is the same level as the 2-action _harm_ or _heal_ you cast and doesn’t cost another spell slot.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
