You mimic the motions of a beast of your devising, and it becomes real, with a flaming pelt and searing claws. It is Small and appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. You can sense from the crawling fire's space as well as your own, using your senses. When you use a fire impulse, you can have it originate from the crawling fire instead of you (with the exception of impulses that affect your kinetic aura).
 The creation lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. Each time you Sustain it, you can have the crawling fire Stride up to 40 feet. The crawling fire can be attacked. It uses your statistics for defenses but is immune to fire. Any damage that would be dealt to the crawling fire is dealt to you instead, though you take damage only once from any ability that includes both you and the creation in the area of effect. If you use Crawling Fire again, any previous one ends.

## Traits

**Fire:**

Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
