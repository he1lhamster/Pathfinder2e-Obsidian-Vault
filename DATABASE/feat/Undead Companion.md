**Prerequisites** an animal companion or a familiar

---
Your companion is also touched by undeath, a mix of a traditional companion and a skeleton, zombie, or stranger form of unlife. Your companion gains the undead trait instead of the animal trait and gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Negative Healing|negative healing]]. It otherwise uses the normal rules for an animal companion or familiar; that means it can still be affected by many conditions or effects to which most undead are immune.

## Traits
