# Undead Companion <span class="item-type">Feat 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Dhampir</span>
**Source** [[Ancestry Guide]] 
**Prerequisites** an animal companion or a familiar

---
Your companion is also touched by undeath, a mix of a traditional companion and a skeleton, zombie, or stranger form of unlife. Your companion gains the undead trait instead of the animal trait and gains [[Negative Healing]]. It otherwise uses the normal rules for an animal companion or familiar; that means it can still be affected by many conditions or effects to which most undead are immune.

## Traits

**Dhampir:**

A creature with this trait has the dhampir versatile heritage. These humanoids are the mortal offspring of [[Vampire]] and members of other ancestries.
