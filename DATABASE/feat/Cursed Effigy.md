---
After your attack, you grab a bit of blood, cut hair, or other piece of the creature's body. You incorporate the material into a premade doll, paper figure, or other effigy to create a sympathetic link that makes it harder to resist your abilities. As long as you are Exploiting Vulnerability against that creature, it takes a –2 status penalty to its saving throws against thaumaturge abilities or items that use your thaumaturge class DC.

## Traits

**Curse:**

A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses. 
Afflictions with this trait are manifestations of potent ill will. A curse either lasts a specified amount of time or can be removed only by certain actions a character must perform or conditions they must meet. A curse with stages follows the rules for afflictions. (_Gamemastery Guide_ pg. 251)

**Esoterica:**

The esoterica trait is present in many thaumaturge feats and class features that incorporate the various talismans, supernatural trinkets, and other objects you carry with you. Abilities that have the esoterica trait require you to be in possession of your esoterica to use them. Normally, you're assumed to always have your esoterica with you, but in some rare circumstances, you might either not have them on hand or have your gear stripped from you.
