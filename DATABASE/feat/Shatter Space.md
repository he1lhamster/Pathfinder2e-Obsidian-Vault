The sheer power of your magic fractures reality. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more actions to cast.

---
**Amp** You or one target of the spell are surrounded by a spiral of torn space. This is an aura, and you choose the radius of the emanation, up to 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn in the aura or enters the aura during its turn takes 1d6 slashing damage for every level of the amped psi cantrip, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. If the creature critically fails, the torn space throws it off balance and it falls prone. The aura lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You can choose whether the aura affects the creature emitting it.

## Traits

**Amp:**

An amp is a special thoughtform that modifies the properties of your psi cantrips. Psi cantrips each have their own amp, and feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps.
