**Source** [[DATABASE/source/PFS Guide|PFS Guide]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Scrollmaster|Scrollmaster]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Scrollmaster Dedication|Scrollmaster Dedication]]
**Trigger** Your turn ends.
**Requirements** You're currently affected by a mental effect that you gained by failing, but not critically failing, a saving throw.

---
To protect the knowledge within your mind from intrusion or erasure, you ward yourself against a mental attack, temporarily delaying its effects. Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single mental effect that meets the requirement. You can suppress a particular effect using Ward Mind or [[DATABASE/feat/Cognitive Loophole|Cognitive Loophole]] only once, even if you have both feats.
**Special** You can use this reaction even if the mental effect prevents you from using reactions.
