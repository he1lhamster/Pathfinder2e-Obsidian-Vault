Your eidolon has enhanced senses. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception, and can't be flanked except by creatures that are higher level than it. It can see [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] creatures and objects; they appear translucent and are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]]. When your eidolon moves within 30 feet of an illusion that can be disbelieved, the GM rolls a secret check to disbelieve it, even if your eidolon didn't spend an action to Interact.

## Traits

**Evolution:**

Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.
