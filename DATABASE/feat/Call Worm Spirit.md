You call forth a ghostly manifestation of the worm spirit. Choose an intersection on the ground within 60 feet; the ghostly maw of a worm emerges from the ground, attacking all creatures in a 10 foot burst. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes 1d10+13 bludgeoning damage as it is battered by the worm's body.
**Failure** The target takes 3d10+15 piercing damage as it is bitten by the worm. The target is [[Immobilized]] until the end of its next turn.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the damage increases to 6d10+30 and the target is knocked [[Prone]].
