Your deceptions confound even the most powerful mortal divinations. Detection, revelation, and scrying effects pass right over you, your possessions, and your auras, detecting nothing unless the detecting effect has a counteract level of 10 or higher. For example, [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] would still detect other magic in the area but not any magic on you, [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]] wouldn't reveal you, [[DATABASE/spell/Locate|locate]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Scrying|scrying]] wouldn't find you, and so on.
