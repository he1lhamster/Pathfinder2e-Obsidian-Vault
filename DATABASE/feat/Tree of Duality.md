PFS Note

---
An ephemeral tree bursts forth, floating on air in an unoccupied square of your choice within 60 feet. Blooming flowers and fungal growths shed pollen and spores, which a swirling gust of air spreads in a 10-foot emanation around it. The tree lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain it up to 1 minute.

* **Cleansing Pollen** (healing, vitality) Each living ally that's in the area or enters it regains 3d4 HP and is then temporarily immune to regaining HP from Tree of Duality for 10 minutes.
* **Hallucinogenic Spores** (mental) Enemies in the area are [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]]. An enemy that leaves the area remains dazzled until the start of its next turn.

**Level (+2)** The healing increases by 1d4.

## Traits

**Air:**

Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air with various degrees of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies.

**Composite:**

A composite impulse combines multiple elements. You can gain an impulse with the composite trait only if your kinetic elements include all the elements listed in the impulse's traits.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Wood:**

Effects with the wood trait conjure or manipulate wood. Those that manipulate wood have no effect in an area without wood. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of wood or have a connection to magical wood.
