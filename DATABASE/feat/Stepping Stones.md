Disks of rock fly to points that you designate to make a new path. You can set them horizontally to make a path across the ground or atop a liquid, or anchor them into a vertical surface to make steps. The path can be up to 20 feet (4 squares) long, and steps can extend up to 10 feet up the side of the surface. All squares must be contiguous and within 60 feet of you. Moving across the path lets a creature ignore difficult terrain and hazardous terrain from the ground beneath it. The disks last until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain the impulse.

---
**Level (+2)** Increase the length of the path by 10 feet or the height of the steps by 5 feet, and increase the maximum distance away from you a square can be by 10 feet.

## Traits

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
