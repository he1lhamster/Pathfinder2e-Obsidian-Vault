**Prerequisites** You've been reduced to 0 Hit Points by an enemy with the negative trait.

---
Experiences with necromantic energy have left a permanent mark on you, casting you in a deathlike pallor, chilling your body temperature to be ice-cold, turning your very blood black, and giving you the power to rip out an enemy's life force. Strike with an unarmed attack. If you hit and the target is a living creature, it takes 4d6 additional negative damage, depending on its Fortitude save. If the target takes any negative damage, you gain an equal number of temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute.
**Critical Success** The enemy takes no additional negative damage and becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Success** The enemy takes half the additional negative damage.
**Failure** The enemy takes full additional negative damage.
**Critical Failure** The enemy takes double the additional negative damage.

## Traits

**Aftermath:**

This trait describes feats that represent special abilities gained after exposure to the weird and deadly.

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
 Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

**Necromancy:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death.

**Negative:**

Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with negative energy, deal negative damage to living creatures, or manipulate negative energy. Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life from the living. Creatures with this trait are natives of the [[DATABASE/plane/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]]. They can survive the basic environmental effects of the Negative Energy Plane.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
