You have been granted a sliver of the power of the [[Yamaraj]], the magistrates of the dead who agreed to allow duskwalkers to exist at all. You exhale a blast of icy wind and ravenous insects. This is a 30-foot cone that deals 14d6 slashing damage and 4d6 [[Persistent Damage]] (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a critical failure, targets also become [[Sickened]].
