---
You relate a loud and impressive tale of your triumph over a formidable foe. When you [[DATABASE/action/Perform|Perform]], choose a single target within 30 feet of you and compare the result of your Performance check to that observer's Will DC. If you're a master in Performance, you can choose up to four targets, and if you're legendary, you can choose any number of targets. If you succeed, any attempt made by you to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] that creature within the next 24 hours gains a +1 circumstance bonus. If your Charisma score is 20 or higher and you're a master in Performance, this bonus increases to +2. Once a creature is boasted at in this manner, it becomes temporarily immune to further Triumphant Boasts for 24 hours.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

### Adventuring with Amiri

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
As Amiri explores the Stolen Lands, her legend grows with her. Already a larger-than-life personality, she begins to accidentally encourage something akin to a cult of personality in the PCs' kingdom. If brought to her attention that a new generation of adventurers are using her exploits and legends as an inspiration for their own adventuring style, she's amused but also perhaps a bit put off by the idea.
 The following new skill feats become available to the PCs starting at 4th level, assuming Amiri remains allied with them.
