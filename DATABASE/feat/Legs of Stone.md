You gain a +2 status bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] you. You can Shove creatures even if you don’t have a hand free. When you successfully Shove a foe, you can Stride away from your opponent (instead of toward it), but you must move the same distance in the opposite direction from where you Shoved it.
