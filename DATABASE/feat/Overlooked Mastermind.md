Many consider half-orcs little more than dumb brutes. This is offensive to you, but it can occasionally be useful. You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] (or another skill of your choice if you were already trained in Deception), and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Lie when specifically claiming ignorance and to Deception DCs against [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] checks to uncover such lies.

## Traits

**Half-Orc:**
