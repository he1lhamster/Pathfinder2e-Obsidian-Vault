You know good artisanship when you see it and can wax poetic about crafting techniques and forms. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on all Crafting checks made to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]. If you would automatically become trained in Crafting (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. In addition, you gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Crafter's Appraisal|Crafter's Appraisal]] skill feat, enabling you to identify magic items using the Crafting skill.
