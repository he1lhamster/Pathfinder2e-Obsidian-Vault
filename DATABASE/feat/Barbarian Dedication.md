# Barbarian Dedication <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span><span class="item-trait">Multiclass</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Barbarian|Barbarian]]
**Prerequisites** Strength 14; Constitution 14

---
You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]]; if you were already trained in Athletics, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC.
 You can use the Rage action.
 Choose an instinct as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you don’t gain any of the other abilities it grants.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the barbarian archetype.

<span class="item-trait">Barbarian</span><span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span><span class="item-trait">Emotion</span><span class="item-trait">Mental</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Requirements** You aren’t [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] or raging.

---
You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging:

* You deal 2 additional damage with melee Strikes. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile. 
* You take a –1 penalty to AC. 
* You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] while raging.

After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute.
