Your innate magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. Additionally, if the triggering effect is arcane, if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
**Enhancement** Your safeguards improve. When you Resist Magic, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the spell level of the triggering effect.
