# Clan Pistol <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Dwarf</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

---
Raised in the ancient halls of Dongun Hold or the surrounding region, you display your lineage with a clan pistol, rather than a clan dagger. You get one clan pistol of your clan for free, as it was given to you at birth. This replaces your [[Clan Dagger]]. Selling this pistol is a terrible taboo and earns you the disdain of other dwarves. You are trained with the clan pistol. In addition, when your clan pistol is visible, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on checks to [[Gather Information]] or [[Make an Impression]] when interacting with citizens of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or their allies.
