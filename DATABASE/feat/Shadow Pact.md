You can take 1 damage to mix blood and shadows to cast 5th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Creation|creation]] as an innate divine spell. You can use this ability as often as you wish, but you can have only one such object in existence at a time. If the object encounters bright light, the spell ends and the object dissolves into shadows.
