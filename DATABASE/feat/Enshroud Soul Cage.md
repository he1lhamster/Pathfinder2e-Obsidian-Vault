# Enshroud Soul Cage <span class="item-type">Feat 14</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Lich|Lich]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Lich Dedication|Lich Dedication]]

---
You wreathe your [[DATABASE/equipment/Soul Cage|soul cage]] in an ever-growing collection of obfuscating illusions and protective abjurations to hide it from your enemies. You disguise the _soul cage_ as any non-magical object of the same Bulk, and it gains the effects of the [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Aura|magic aura]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Nondetection|nondetection]] spells. The effects have unlimited durations, are heightened to half your level rounded up, and use your spell DC against any attempt to counteract them. The magic aura makes your _soul cage_ appear non-magical. You can ignore the effects of any of these spells when dealing with your own _soul cage_. You are mentally alerted whenever your _soul cage_ is damaged.
