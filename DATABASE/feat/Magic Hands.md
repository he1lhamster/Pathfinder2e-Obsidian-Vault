The blessing of your deity heightens your healing ability, making your mundane healing work as if by magic. When you succeed at a [[Medicine]] check to [[Treat Wounds]], your action gains the divine trait and you heal the maximum amount for the 2d8 (or 4d8 on a critical success). If you have an ability that adds additional dice to your Treat Wounds, you still roll those normally.
