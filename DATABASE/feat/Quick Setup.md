You have learned to setup simple crafting jobs with ease. Your setup time for consumables that are at least 6 levels lower than you is 1 day, and your setup time for permanent items 6 levels lower than you is 3 days.
 If you rush the setup and reduce the setup time for consumables at least 6 levels lower than you to less than 1 day, you can instead set them up in just 2 hours (allowing you to do so during an adventuring day if you have access to your tools and materials). If you rush the setup of a permanent item at least 6 levels lower than you and reduce the setup time to less than 1 day, you can perform the setup in 4 hours.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
