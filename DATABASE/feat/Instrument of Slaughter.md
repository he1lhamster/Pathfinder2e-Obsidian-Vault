Your blade ally thirsts for the blood of your foes. Whenever you critically hit an enemy with the weapon inhabited by your blade ally while dealing extra damage from your champion's reaction, the target takes [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] equal to two of the weapon's damage dice.

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
