# Sense Evil <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Champion</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Exorcist|Exorcist]]*
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/championtenet/Good|tenets of good]]
* This archetype offers Sense Evil at a different level than displayed here.

---
You sense evil as a queasy or foreboding feeling. When in the presence of an aura of evil that is [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Alignment|powerful or overwhelming]], you eventually detect the aura, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint the location. This acts as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. An evil creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check against your Perception DC to hide its aura from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Evil for 1 day.
