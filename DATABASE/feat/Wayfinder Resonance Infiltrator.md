You are adept at using the unusual resonance of your [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]] to aid in any deceptions you might employ. Once per day you can activate your _wayfinder_ to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Disguise|illusory disguise]], heightened to 2nd level, as an arcane spell. Additionally, once per day, you can Activate your _wayfinder_ with a single-action envision activation to transform it into a perfect replica of another similarly sized badge of membership or office, such as an Aspis Consortium badge. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.
