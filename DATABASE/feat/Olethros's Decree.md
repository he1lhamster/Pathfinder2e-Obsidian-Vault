You have a connection to olethroses, the enigmatic [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomps]] who successfully swayed the [[DATABASE/monster/Yamaraj|yamaraj]] to permit the creation of the first duskwalkers. You place a finger on fate's scales by wrapping silk around your bow. The first time this turn that you hit a creature with a Strike using a weapon in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Bow|bow]] group you've modified in this way, that creature takes an additional 60 damage (basic Fortitude save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher) as the arrow works to cut short their very destiny. This additional damage is of the same type as the initial attack dealt. If you hit more than one creature at the same time, choose one to suffer the effect of your decree.

## Traits

**Death:**

An effect with the death trait kills you immediately if it reduces you to 0 HP. Some death effects can bring you closer to death or slay you outright without reducing you to 0 HP.

**Divine:**

This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Duskwalker:**

A creature with this trait has the duskwalker versatile heritage. Duskwalkers are planar scions infused with the supernatural energy of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomps]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by duskwalkers.

**Necromancy:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death.
