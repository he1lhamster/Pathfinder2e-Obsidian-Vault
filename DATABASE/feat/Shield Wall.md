**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
**Trigger** Your shield is raised and an adjacent ally [[Raise a Shield]].

---
You use your shield in tandem with an ally's, forming a barricade. Both you and the triggering creature have standard cover as long as you remain adjacent to each other and you both have your shields raised; when this is no longer the case, the effect ends. You and your ally can't use this cover to [[Hide]], as it's obvious you're standing there holding your shields, but you and your ally can use it to [[Take Cover]]. Normally, if you and your ally don't move, Shield Wall lasts until the beginning of your next turn, when your shield is no longer raised.

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
