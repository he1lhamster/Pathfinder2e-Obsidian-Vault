# Tracing Sigil <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Spell Trickster|Spell Trickster]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Spell Trickster Dedication|Spell Trickster Dedication]]; ability to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Sigil|sigil]]

When you cast _sigil_, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: The target leaves a magical trail that you and others can try to follow. You and other creatures can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Track|Track]] the target, substituting an [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]], [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] check (whichever matches the magical tradition of your sigil spell) for the [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] check. Much like Tracking with Survival, this must take place somewhere the target has been and follow the trail; it doesn't allow anyone to find the target from a distance. You can only have a single target marked with a modified sigil in this way. If you use this ability again on a second target, the _sigil_ spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.
