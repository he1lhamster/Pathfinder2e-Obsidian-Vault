---
You become trained in either [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]]; if you were already trained in both these skills, you become an expert in one of them instead. You gain either the [[DATABASE/feat/Ki Rush|Ki Rush]] or [[DATABASE/feat/Ki Strike|Ki Strike]] monk feat, which grants you a ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] activity as a [[DATABASE/class_/Monk|monk]] does. If you already have both feats, you can instead choose a single 1st-level monk feat.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the Jalmeri Heavenseeker or [[DATABASE/archetype/Student of Perfection|Student of Perfection]] archetypes.
