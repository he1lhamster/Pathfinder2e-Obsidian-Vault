**Trigger** A creature within your eidolon's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

---
Your eidolon makes a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, your eidolon disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.

## Traits

**Eidolon:**

A creature with this trait is a [[DATABASE/class_/Summoner|summoner's]] eidolon. An action or spell with this trait can be performed by an eidolon only. An item with this trait can be used or worn by an eidolon only, and an eidolon can't use items that don't have this trait. (An eidolon can have up to two items invested.)

**Evolution:**

Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.
