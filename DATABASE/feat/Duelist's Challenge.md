Select one foe that you can see and proclaim a challenge. That foe is your dueling opponent until they are defeated, flee, or the encounter ends. Any time you hit that enemy using a single one-handed melee weapon while your other hand or hands are free, you gain a circumstance bonus to the Strike's damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals.
 If you attack a creature other than your dueling opponent, you take a circumstance penalty to damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals.
