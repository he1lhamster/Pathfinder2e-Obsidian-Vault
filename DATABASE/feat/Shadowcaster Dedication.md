**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Shadowcaster|Shadowcaster]]
**Prerequisites** ability to cast spells

---
You've sacrificed a piece of your spirit, allowing the powers of shadow into your being and changing the nature of your magic. You can no longer cast spells that have the light trait; if an ability, such as a class feature or ancestry feat, would automatically grant you a light spell, such as the [[DATABASE/feat/Domain Initiate|Domain Initiate]] feat granting you the [[DATABASE/spell/Dazzling Flash|dazzling flash]] spell, you don't gain that spell.
 You gain the [[DATABASE/spell/Cloak of Shadow|cloak of shadow]] domain spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] activity. You can Refocus by meditating to siphon power from the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] and refill your focus pool. Your domain spells from the shadowcaster archetype are of the same tradition as the spells you used to meet the shadowcaster archetype's prerequisites.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the shadowcaster archetype.
