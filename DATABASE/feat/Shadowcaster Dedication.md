# Shadowcaster Dedication <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
**Archetype** [[Shadowcaster]]
**Prerequisites** ability to cast spells

---
You've sacrificed a piece of your spirit, allowing the powers of shadow into your being and changing the nature of your magic. You can no longer cast spells that have the light trait; if an ability, such as a class feature or ancestry feat, would automatically grant you a light spell, such as the [[Domain Initiate]] feat granting you the [[Dazzling Flash]] spell, you don't gain that spell.
 You gain the [[Cloak of Shadow]] domain spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [[Refocus]] activity. You can Refocus by meditating to siphon power from the [[Shadow Plane]] and refill your focus pool. Your domain spells from the shadowcaster archetype are of the same tradition as the spells you used to meet the shadowcaster archetype's prerequisites.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the shadowcaster archetype.

## Shadowcaster Dedication Leads To...

[[Disciple of Shade]], [[Shadow Reservoir]], [[Shadow Spell]], [[Shadow Spells]], [[Unending Emptiness]]
