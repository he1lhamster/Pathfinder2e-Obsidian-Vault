You can react whenever a foe leaves a gap in their defenses. At the start of each enemy's turn, you gain an extra reaction you can use only during that turn to perform an [[DATABASE/action/Opportune Riposte|Opportune Riposte]], or an [[DATABASE/feat/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]] if you have that reaction.
