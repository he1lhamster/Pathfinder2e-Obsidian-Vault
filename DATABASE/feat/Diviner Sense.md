You sense magical dangers. When using the [[DATABASE/action/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]] exploration activity, you can roll initiative twice and use the better result so long as at least one opponent has a magical effect or magic item and is in range of your [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]].

## Traits

**Divination:**

The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
