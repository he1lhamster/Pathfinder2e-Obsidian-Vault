You tumble around your foes, expertly avoiding their reactions. Stride up to half your Speed and roll an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check. Compare the result to the Reflex DC of each foe whose reach you began in or enter during the movement, in sequence.
**Critical Success** This movement doesn't trigger reactions from the foe, the foe is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to you until the end of your turn, and you gain panache.
**Success** This movement doesn't trigger reactions from the foe, and you gain panache.
**Critical Failure** Your movement immediately stops when you enter the creature's reach; if you began in the creature's reach, you don't move.
