**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]

**Trigger** A creature you can see damages you with a melee Strike.

---
You respond with a startled look, dramatic pratfall, or theatrical arm-flailing that stymies your attacker. The attacker must succeed at a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 round (stupefied 2 on a critical failure).

## Traits

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Poppet:**

Small constructs originally designed to serve as companions or servants. They occasionally gain a greater spark of life, transforming them into independent, sapient creatures.
