<span class="item-trait">Light</span><span class="item-trait">Talos</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes
**Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of you targets you, and you can see the attacker.
**Requirements** You are in dim or bright light.

---
Your body's natural luster has been polished to a gleaming shine. You use this to reflect light back into your enemy's eyes, disrupting its aim and focus; it must succeed at a Reflex save against your class DC or be [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the end of your next turn.

## Traits

**Light:**

Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.

**Talos:**

Taloses are [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Planar Scion|planar scions]] descended from [[DATABASE/monster/Zuhra|zuhras]].
