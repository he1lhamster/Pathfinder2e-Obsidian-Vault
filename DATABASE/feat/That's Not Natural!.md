**Prerequisites** expert in [[Survival]]

---
Your mastery at surviving in the wild has given you a sort of sixth-sense when it comes to noticing creatures that aren't part of the natural order. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all initiative checks made at the start of a battle in which at least one of your enemies is an aberration, fey, mutant, or undead, or if one of your enemies is from a plane other than the [[Material Plane]], as long as the battle takes place in a wilderness region. In wilderness regions, you also increase your Perception DC by 1 against these types of creatures for the purposes of resolving their [[Stealth]] checks. If you're master in Survival, this circumstance bonus increases to +2.
 If you know the [[Commune with Nature]] ritual, you can use Survival as a primary or secondary check to resolve that ritual—if you do so, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

### Adventuring with Amiri

**Source** [[Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
As Amiri explores the Stolen Lands, her legend grows with her. Already a larger-than-life personality, she begins to accidentally encourage something akin to a cult of personality in the PCs' kingdom. If brought to her attention that a new generation of adventurers are using her exploits and legends as an inspiration for their own adventuring style, she's amused but also perhaps a bit put off by the idea.
 The following new skill feats become available to the PCs starting at 4th level, assuming Amiri remains allied with them.
