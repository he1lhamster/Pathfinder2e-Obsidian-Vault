You have reconfigured the magical resonance of your core to attune to the planar energies of [[DATABASE/plane/Axis|Axis]]. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|plane shift]] twice per week as an arcane innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to Axis or the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], and your body serves as the focus component.

## Traits
