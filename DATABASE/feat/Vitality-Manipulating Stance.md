You have learned to attack meridians and pressure points like your rival Shino Hakusa. You gain a vitality blast ranged unarmed Strike that deals 1d4 negative damage, has a range of 30 feet, and has the unarmed and versatile positive traits.
 Additionally, when you use [[Stunning Fist]], instead of saving against being [[Stunned]], you can choose to have the target make a Fortitude save against your class DC with the following results. You must choose to do this before the target rolls its save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target's muscles become temporarily weaker. For 1 round, the target is [[Enfeebled]], and any time it attempts to take an action with the manipulate trait, the action is disrupted unless it succeeds at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + its enfeebled value.
**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute, the flat check is DC 11, and the target takes –10-foot status penalty to all Speeds for the duration.

## Traits

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
