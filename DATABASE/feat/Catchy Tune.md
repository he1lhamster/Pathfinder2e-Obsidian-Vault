You create a tune so catchy, your foes can't help but dance along. Attempt a [[Performance]] check against the Will DCs of all enemies in a 30-foot emanation.
**Critical Success** The target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed and is [[Flat-Footed]], both for 1 round.
**Success** The target takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** The target is temporarily immune for 1 hour.

## Traits

**Auditory:**

Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as [[Deafened]] targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Emotion:**

This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Sprite:**

A family of diminutive winged fey with a strong connection to primal magic.
