Choose a second kinetic element to add to the one you already have. You gain an impulse feat for that element. For the purpose of meeting its prerequisites, your kineticist level is equal to half your level. If you gain more kineticist feats, you can select hybrid impulses that have both your elements, as normal for a kineticist.
