**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
**Archetype** [[Sleepwalker]]

---
You draw no distinction between the sleeping and waking worlds. Your [[Sleepwalker Dedication]] has an unlimited duration, and you no longer need to take an action to enter it. If you're [[Unconscious]] due to sleep, you don't take the –4 penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and don't have the [[Flat-Footed]] condition. You're still [[Blinded]] while asleep. You can act on your turn while asleep, though you're [[Slowed]] until you fully awaken.
