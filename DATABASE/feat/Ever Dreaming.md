You draw no distinction between the sleeping and waking worlds. Your [[DATABASE/feat/Sleepwalker Dedication|Daydream Trance]] has an unlimited duration, and you no longer need to take an action to enter it. If you're [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] due to sleep, you don't take the –4 penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and don't have the [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] condition. You're still [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] while asleep. You can act on your turn while asleep, though you're [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 2]] until you fully awaken.
