---
The vanaras of old were tricksters able to step across wide rivers or slip into impossibly small spaces. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Enlarge|enlarge]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Shrink|shrink]] once per day each as 2nd-level divine innate spells. You can target only yourself and other vanaras with these spells.
