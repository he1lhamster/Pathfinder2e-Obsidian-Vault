When you cast [[Fireball]] heightened to at least 6th level, you can modify the spell's standard effects as follows: Reduce the spell's damage by 6d6. Your fireball leaves behind a lingering cloud of toxic smoke in its area. While it's smoke instead of mist, this cloud otherwise has the effects of [[Stinking Cloud]].
