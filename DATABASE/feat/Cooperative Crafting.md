---
You've learned to make the most of working with others on your crafting projects, a must when working with the various guilds of Highhelm. If an ally is attempting to [[Aid]] you with your Crafting, you ignore the –1 circumstance penalty if they roll a critical failure. If an ally also has the Cooperative Crafting feat, you can choose to pool your resources and work on the same item together; you can only work with 1 ally in this way. Both of you attempt a Crafting check on the same item; if you both succeed, reduce the minimum time to craft the item by 1 day. When determining the level of item you and your ally can craft, you use the higher of your level or your ally's level plus 1. If you attempt to [[Craft]] an item that's a higher level than either of you and one of you fails, both checks become critical failures instead.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
