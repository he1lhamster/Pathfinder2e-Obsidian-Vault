**Requirements** A creature is in your and your eidolon's reach.

---
You and your eidolon each attack, seamlessly targeting the same foe without interfering with each other's movements. Your eidolon makes a melee Strike, and then you make a melee Strike against the same creature. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks have been made.

## Traits

**Tandem:**

Actions with this trait involve you and your eidolon acting in concert. You can't use a tandem action if either you or your eidolon can't act, if you haven't [[DATABASE/action/Manifest Eidolon|Manifested your Eidolon]], or if you've Manifested your Eidolon in a way where it isn't a separate entity (such as with the [[DATABASE/feat/Meld into Eidolon|Meld into Eidolon]] feat). Tandem actions often let both you and your eidolon take separate actions, but these must be actions taken separately by you and your eidolon; you can't use a tandem action to take another tandem action.
