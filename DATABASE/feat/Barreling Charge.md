You rush forward, moving enemies aside to reach your foe. You Stride, attempting to move through your enemies' spaces and make a melee Strike. Roll an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check and compare the result to the Fortitude DC of each creature whose space you attempt to move through during your Stride, moving through its space on a success but ending your movement before entering its space on a failure. You can use Barreling Charge to [[DATABASE/action/Burrow|Burrow]], [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]], or [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]] instead of Stride, as long as you have the corresponding movement type.
