<span class="item-trait">Monk</span><span class="item-trait">Stance</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[Martial Artist]]*
**Requirements** You are unarmored and touching the ground.
* This archetype offers Mountain Stance at a different level than displayed here.

---
You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—a technique first discovered by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with the weight of an avalanche. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the [[Brawling]] group; and have the forceful, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
 While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 item bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against being [[Shove]] or [[Trip]]. However, you have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5 feet. The item bonus to AC from Mountain Stance is cumulative with [[Armor Potency]] on your [[Explorer's Clothing]], [[Mage Armor]], and [[Bracers of Armor]].

## Traits

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
