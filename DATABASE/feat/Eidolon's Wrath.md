Your eidolon gains the [[DATABASE/spell/Eidolon's Wrath|eidolon's wrath]] focus spell, which it casts, instead of you. You determine the damage type when you gain the feat: acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative, positive, or sonic. If your eidolon is a celestial, fiend, or monitor with an alignment other than true neutral, you can choose a damage type in its alignment. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. As normal, your eidolon shares your Focus Points.

## Traits

**Evolution:**

Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.
