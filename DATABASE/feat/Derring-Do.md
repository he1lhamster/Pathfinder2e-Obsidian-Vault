When you compound panache with even more derring-do, it somehow tends to work out. When you already have panache, you can roll twice and use the higher result on checks to which the circumstance bonus for having panache applies ([[DATABASE/action/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] and any skill actions listed in your swashbuckler's style).

## Traits

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
