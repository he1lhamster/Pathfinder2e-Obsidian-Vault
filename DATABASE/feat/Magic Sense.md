**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Lich|Lich]]*
* This archetype offers Magic Sense at a different level than displayed here.

---
You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.
**Special** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).
