Your spells become a radiant display of light and color. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that doesn't have the darkness trait, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a Reflex save, the spell explodes in a spray of scintillating lights, in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round, and those who critically failed are instead [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round.

## Archetype Use

This feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Light:**

Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
