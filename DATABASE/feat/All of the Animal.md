---
You know how to make the best and most efficient use of a hunted animal's carcass. Choose a Large or larger corpse of an animal that died within the past day. While using Survival to [[DATABASE/action/Subsist|Subsist]] near the carcass, you always receive enough food for yourself and one additional Medium creature, using up the meat from the carcass to do so. Since you're using all of the animal, others can't use the carcass's meat for any other purpose, including their own use of All of the Animal.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

### Skill Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 175. Broken Tusk Moon|Pathfinder #175: Broken Tusk Moon]]
Characters can gain access to the following new skill feats throughout “Broken Tusk Moon.”
 **All of the Animal**: Head scout Wipa teaches this skill feat to characters who help her butcher an animal for meat, such as the moose at the beginning of the adventure or another animal slain throughout the course of the Broken Tusk following's journey.
 **Spirit Speaker**: Mammoth Lord Argakoa, also known as Argakoa the Songsinger, might teach a fraction of her tremendous skill to a young scout who joins her in song. 
**Tame Animal**: The young herd tender Imek has a natural way with animals. She is happy to teach what she knows to any characters who display a similar reverence toward living creatures, such as by peacefully resolving their encounter with the giant porcupine in Chapter 1 of this adventure. Although this feat is particularly useful to characters who want to recruit animal followers throughout the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path, it isn't strictly necessary for the party to succeed in their adventures. It can be a great boon to parties taking part in other quests, as well.
