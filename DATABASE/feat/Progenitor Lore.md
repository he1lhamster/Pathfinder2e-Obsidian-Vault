**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]

---
You didn't just inherit your physical form from your progenitor; you also retained some of their knowledge. You're trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] corresponding to your ancestry (e. g., Elf Lore if your progenitor is an [[DATABASE/ancestry/Elf|elf]]).
