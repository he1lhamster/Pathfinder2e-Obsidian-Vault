**Source** [[Dark Archive]]

---
You didn't just inherit your physical form from your progenitor; you also retained some of their knowledge. You're trained in [[Deception]] and [[Occultism]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [[Lore]] corresponding to your ancestry (e. g., Elf Lore if your progenitor is an [[Elf]]).

## Traits
