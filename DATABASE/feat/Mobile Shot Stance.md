**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[Archer]]*
* This archetype offers Mobile Shot Stance at a different level than displayed here.

---
Your shots become nimble and deadly. While you're in this stance, your ranged Strikes don't trigger [[Attack of Opportunity]] or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack.
 If you have Attack of Opportunity, you can use it with a loaded ranged weapon you're wielding. The triggering creature must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.

## Archetype Use

This feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.

## Traits

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
