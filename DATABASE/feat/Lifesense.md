You have a limited ability to sense life force, like your [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomp]] forebears. You gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Lifesense|lifesense]] as an imprecise sense with a range of 10 feet. This allows you to sense the life force within living creatures and its counterforce that animates the undead, though you can't distinguish between the two.
