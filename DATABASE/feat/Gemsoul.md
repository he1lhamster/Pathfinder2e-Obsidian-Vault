The earth inside you asserts itself as crystallized gemstones or metals, like a cluster of quartz or veins of iron and gold. This shimmering presence inside your being inspires you to flashy and flamboyant performances. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]]. If you would automatically become trained in Performance (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Impressive Performance|Impressive Performance]] skill feat.
