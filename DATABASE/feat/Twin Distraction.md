Your movements with two weapons are so swift and disorienting that they befuddle your opponent. When using Twin Feint, if both your Strikes deal damage to a targeted creature, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw against your class DC or become [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn.
