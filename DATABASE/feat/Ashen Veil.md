By smearing ash or tainted earth over your skin and armor, you shroud yourself from the dead. You become concealed to undead using vision or [[DATABASE/monsterability/Lifesense|lifesense]], allowing you to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] and [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]] without other sources of cover or concealment. This effect lasts only as long as you continue to take no actions other than to Hide, Sneak, or other surreptitious actions. The GM determines which actions end the effect, but attacking, casting spells, activating items, and the like always do.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
