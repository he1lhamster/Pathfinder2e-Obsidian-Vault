**Access** Help either the Washboard Dogs or the Diobel Sweepers destroy their rival.
**Requirements** You're wielding a melee weapon that deals slashing damage and you have a free hand.

---
You attempt a melee Strike with the required weapon. If you hit and deal damage and the result of your attack roll exceeds the target's Perception DC, you [[DATABASE/action/Steal|Steal]] a small object from the target (as if you had succeeded at that task using the [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] skill). Depending on the object, the target might realize that it has been stolen, and onlookers might realize you have stolen the object if the attack roll doesn't exceed their Perception DCs.

## Traits

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

### Gang Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 159. All or Nothing|Pathfinder #159: All or Nothing]]
Street gangs in Absalom recruit amateur pickpockets, ruffians, and vandals who show promise in their specialties and operate well in tight groups.
 Rogue agents can gain access to some of the following rogue feats by successfully helping Maurrisa Jonne or Bloody Berleth eliminate their rival (see Chapter 1). Some of these feats, however, can be gained only by helping a particular side in the gang conflict.
