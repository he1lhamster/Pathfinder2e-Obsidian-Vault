**Prerequisites** You've partied extensively with an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Azata|azata]] or entered a romantic relationship with an azata.

---
You've been ensnared by an azata's infectious enthusiasm for life, love, and freedom that manifests as a pearlescent afterimage in your graceful movements, a spring in your soft steps, an ever-present melody in your euphonic voice, and eddies of passionate colors in your mesmerizing eyes. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], or a +2 circumstance bonus if the target is chaotic good. You gain the Set Free reaction.
 **Set Free** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (fortune) **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You attempt a check to remove or counteract an effect with the [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]], [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]], [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] conditions; **Effect** You roll twice and use the better result.

## Traits

**Aftermath:**

This trait describes feats that represent special abilities gained after exposure to the weird and deadly.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
