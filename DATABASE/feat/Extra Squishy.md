Your rubbery physique makes it easier for you to wedge yourself into tight spaces and more difficult for your enemies to dislodge you. You become trained in [[Acrobatics]]. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. If you roll a success to [[Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead. While you're Squeezing, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DCs against attempts to [[Shove]] you or otherwise move you from your space.
