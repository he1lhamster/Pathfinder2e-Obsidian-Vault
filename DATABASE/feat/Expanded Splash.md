The particularly volatile compounds that you brew into your bombs result in them creating especially large and powerful explosions. When you throw an alchemical bomb that has the splash trait, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the bomb’s usual splash damage, and it deals splash damage to every creature within 10 feet of the target.
