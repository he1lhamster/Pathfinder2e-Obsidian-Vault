You have learned some of the tricks the fey use to bend primal magic toward illusions and trickery. Add [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Disguise|illusory disguise]], [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Object|illusory object]], [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Scene|illusory scene]], and [[DATABASE/spell/Veil|veil]] to your spell list as primal spells.
