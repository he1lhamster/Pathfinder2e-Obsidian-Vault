## Traits

**Catfolk:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the [[Catfolk]] ancestry. Catfolk are humanoids with feline features. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by catfolk. An item with this trait is created and used by catfolk.

**Divination:**

The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.

**Misfortune:**

A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.
