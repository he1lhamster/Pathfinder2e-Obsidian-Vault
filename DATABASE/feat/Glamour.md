**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Fey Influence|Fey Influence]]

---
You unlock a new level of fey power and can manipulate the perceptions of others using a font of First World magic. You gain the [[DATABASE/spell/Fey Glamour|fey glamour]] focus spell as a primal spell that doesn't have the sorcerer trait. If you don't already have a focus pool, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point.
**Special** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|human]], goblin for [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblin]], etc.).

## Traits

**All Ancestries:**

A feat with this trait is available to all ancestries.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
