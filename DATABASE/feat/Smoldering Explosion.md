When you cast _fireball_ heightened to at least 4th level, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: Your _fireball_ leaves behind a brief cloud of smoke in its area. While it's smoke instead of mist, this cloud otherwise has the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]], except that it lasts only 1 round.
