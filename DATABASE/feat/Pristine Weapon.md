Your [[Verdant Weapon]] can cut through the resistances of magical creatures. The weapon is treated as [[Cold Iron Weapon]] and [[Silver Weapon]]. If you critically hit a creature that has a weakness to cold iron or silver, the target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]] as the primal energies within your weapon slow its natural healing.
