Your [[DATABASE/feat/Verdant Weapon|verdant weapon]] can cut through the resistances of magical creatures. The weapon is treated as [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]] and [[DATABASE/equipment/Silver Weapon|silver]]. If you critically hit a creature that has a weakness to cold iron or silver, the target takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] as the primal energies within your weapon slow its natural healing.
