If you fail a recovery check while [[Dying]], your dying condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your dying condition increases by only 1. You become trained in Ancient Osirion [[Lore]], or expert if you were already trained.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the living monolith archetype.
