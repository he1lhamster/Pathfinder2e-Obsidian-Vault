**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

---
You've grown up around a forge and are well-suited to dealing with smoke and flame. Your flat check to remove [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]] is DC 10 instead of DC 15, which is reduced to DC 5 with appropriate assistance. In addition, if you roll a success on a saving throw against suffocation or choking due to smoke or ash, you get a critical success instead.

## Traits

**Dwarf:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the dwarf ancestry. Dwarves are stout folk who often live underground and typically have [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by dwarves. An item with this trait is created and used by dwarves.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
