# Snare Genius <span class="item-type">Feat 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Kobold</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Prerequisites** expert in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]]; [[DATABASE/feat/Snare Crafting|Snare Crafting]]

Your expertise makes your snares more powerful, and you can place them quickly and efficiently. Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare three snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if the snare normally takes 1 minute to [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]], you can Craft it with 3 Interact actions. Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft. The number of snares you can prepare this way increases to four if you are a master in Crafting, and to five if you are legendary.
 When you Craft and deploy a snare that deals damage, any creature that critically fails its saving throw against the snare's initial effect and takes damage becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until the end of its next turn.
