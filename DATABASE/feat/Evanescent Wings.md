You've manifested wings that can flutter for brief spurts. You don't need to spend any additional actions to reach something in your space that a Medium creature could reach. For instance, if you wanted to open a cookie jar located four feet off the ground, you only need to spend a single Interact action to do so. When you use Evanescent Wings to flutter to a higher place in your space, your action gains the move trait.
