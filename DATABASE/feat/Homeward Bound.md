**Frequency** twice per week

---
The connection between you and the [[First World]] resonates within your body stronger than it does for most gnomes, allowing you to cross the threshold between the [[Material Plane]] and the First World. You gain [[Plane Shift]] as a primal innate spell. You can cast it twice per week. This can be used only to travel back and forth between the First World and the Material Plane. Due to your body's natural resonance, you can act as the spell focus, and you don't require a tuning fork.

## Traits

**Gnome:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the gnome ancestry. Gnomes are small people skilled at magic who seek out new experiences and usually have [[Low-Light Vision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by gnomes. A weapon with this trait is created and used by gnomes.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
