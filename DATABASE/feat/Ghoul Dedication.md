# Ghoul Dedication <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Archetype** [[Ghoul]]
**Prerequisites** You were killed by ghoul fever.

---
You have succumbed to ghoul fever, dying and returning as a [[Ghoul]], an undead cursed with a never-ending hunger for dead flesh that slowly overrides your reason and willpower until you would do anything for the meal you crave. In addition to the personality changes, your body changes as well. Your ears become pointed, and your skin grows blueish and pale. Your fingernails sharpen into claws; your teeth become razor sharp, ready to tear flesh off the bone; and your tongue grows long and pointed.
 You gain the ghoul and undead traits and the basic undead benefits. Your undead craving is for the flesh of dead creatures; freshly dead corpses from sapient creatures fulfill your cravings much more than non-sapient or rotted corpses, but any dead creature can stave off the hunger for at least a little while. You gain two unarmed attacks in the [[Brawling]] weapon group. The first unarmed attack is a claw that deals 1d4 slashing damage with the agile and finesse traits, and the second unarmed attack is a set of jaws that deal 1d6 piercing damage and have the finesse trait.
 You gain the Consume Flesh action. Satisfying your craving is difficult. Consuming Flesh temporarily satiates you. Many ghoul feats have extra abilities or functions that can be used when you are satiated, though using those abilities also causes you to lose your satiated status. You can always Consume Flesh, but eating more than a normal amount has no further effect; a ghoul's hunger is satiated, or it is not.
 **Consume Flesh** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate) **Requirements** You are adjacent to the corpse of a Small or larger creature that died in the last hour; **Effect** You devour a chunk of the corpse. You become satiated for 1 hour.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the ghoul archetype

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Dedication:**

You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
