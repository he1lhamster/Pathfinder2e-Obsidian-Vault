If your next action is to use your divine font to cast a 3-action [[Heal]] or [[Harm]] spell to damage creatures, you can harness the residual energy to counterbalance opposing forces. You use your heal or harm spell to attempt to counteract one effect in the spell's area with the chaotic, evil, good, or lawful trait. The chosen trait must oppose one component of your deity's alignment; if your deity is neutral, you can choose any one trait.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
