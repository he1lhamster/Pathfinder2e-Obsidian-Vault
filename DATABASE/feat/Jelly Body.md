**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
**Prerequisites** You've been reduced to 0 Hit Points while engulfed by an ooze.

---
Some of the ooze that surrounded you made its way permanently into parts of your body, turning you soft to the touch and semitransparent enough to show bones. You gain resistance equal to your level to precision damage and damage from critical hits. You can submerge up to 1 Bulk of items within your body by sticking them inside of yourself. While the protrusion of the item is still visible from the outside, the items don't count toward making you encumbered or your maximum Bulk while stored in you. You can Interact to retrieve or store an item submerged into your body.

## Traits

**Aftermath:**

This trait describes feats that represent special abilities gained after exposure to the weird and deadly.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
 Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Transmutation:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something’s form.
