When you came of age, your fingernails grew long and sharp. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage. Your claws are in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] group and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.
**Special** claws can develop at any point in a changeling's life, allowing you to select this feat anytime you would gain an ancestry feat, but once you've selected it, you can't retrain out of it.

A creature with this trait has the changeling versatile heritage. Changelings are the children of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Hag|hags]] and members of other humanoid ancestries. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by changelings.
