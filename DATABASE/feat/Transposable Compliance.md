---
Your protean vitality is fecund and many-succoring: your veins run with life-giving ichor that adapts to the blood and physiology of any body, and your skin molts on command, creating wound-stanching sheaths of tissue for yourself and others. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]]. If you were already trained in Medicine, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can [[DATABASE/action/Administer First Aid|Administer First Aid]] without [[DATABASE/equipment/Healer's Tools|healer's tools]] by using your physiology instead, but you must take 1 damage to make the attempt. Similarly, you can [[DATABASE/action/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]] without healer's tools but take 2d8 damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on all Medicine checks to Administer First Aid and Treat Wounds using your own physiology.
