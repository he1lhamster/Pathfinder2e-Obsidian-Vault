Inspired by the tale of Arnisant, you transform your shield into a magic ward. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain the following reaction:

### [[Absorb into the Aegis]] <span class="action-icon">5</span>

**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
**Trigger** An enemy casts a spell that targets you or an ally within 15 feet of you

---
You interpose your shield’s ward against the spell. Attempt a counteract check, using your Religion modifier as your counteract modifier. On a success, the spell is counteracted and your shield takes damage equal to four times the spell level as it absorbs and disperses the magical energy. On a failure, the shield takes damage equal to twice the spell’s level.
