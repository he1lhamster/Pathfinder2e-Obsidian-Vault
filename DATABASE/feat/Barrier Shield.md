When you cast _shield_, you can modify the spell to create a solid barrier you can use for cover, but not for blocking. You can't use the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction when the spell is modified in this way, but you (and only you) can spend an action to [[DATABASE/action/Take Cover|Take Cover]] to gain standard cover from it.
