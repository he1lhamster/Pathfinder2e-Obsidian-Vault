<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Grand Bazaar]]
**Archetype** [[Spell Trickster]]
**Prerequisites** [[Spell Trickster Dedication]]; ability to cast [[Shield]]

---
When you cast _shield_, you can modify the spell to create a solid barrier you can use for cover, but not for blocking. You can't use the [[Shield Block]] reaction when the spell is modified in this way, but you (and only you) can spend an action to [[Take Cover]] to gain standard cover from it.
