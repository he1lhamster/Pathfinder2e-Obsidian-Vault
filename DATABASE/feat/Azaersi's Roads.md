Azaersi has granted you limited access to the Stone Roads, attuning you to the tiniest sliver of the _Onyx Key_. You gain [[DATABASE/spell/Plane Shift|plane shift]] as a primal innate spell. You can cast it twice per week. This can be used only to travel back and forth between the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] and the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]. Due to your attunement to the _Onyx Key_, you can act as the spell focus, and you do not require a tuning fork.

## Traits

They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

### The General's Armory

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Legends|Legends]]Azaersi believes in rewarding loyalty and service, and she is always in search of reliable and trustworthy agents. Sensible officers, clever spies, and trade negotiators who show skill at dealing with non-hobgoblins are all likely to win General Azaersi's favor, and rewards that only she can offer.
