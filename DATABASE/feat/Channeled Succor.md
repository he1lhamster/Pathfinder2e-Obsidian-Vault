You can remove conditions with divine grace. You can sacrifice one [[Heal]] spell you’ve prepared in your extra slots from healing font to cast one of the following spells instead: [[Remove Curse]], [[Remove Disease]], [[Remove Paralysis]], or [[Restoration]]. The spell is heightened to the same level as the _heal_ spell you sacrificed.
