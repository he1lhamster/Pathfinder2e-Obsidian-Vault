You can remove conditions with divine grace. You can sacrifice one [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] spell you’ve prepared in your extra slots from healing font to cast one of the following spells instead: [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Curse|remove curse]], [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Disease|remove disease]], [[DATABASE/spell/Remove Paralysis|remove paralysis]], or [[DATABASE/spell/Restoration|restoration]]. The spell is heightened to the same level as the _heal_ spell you sacrificed.
