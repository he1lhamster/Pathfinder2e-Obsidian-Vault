Seeing an enemy's attack, you quickly consult multiple scraps of lore in your mind, synthesizing them into the perfect plan. Make a check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] (using an appropriate skill) about one creature within 60 feet. On a success, in addition to the normal benefits, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that creature and to your AC against the creature's next attack. On a critical success, the bonuses are +2.

## Traits

**Psyche:**

Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.
