You have witnessed hundreds of fighting styles and quickly adapt to defend against complicated maneuvers. Choose a creature within 30 feet who you’re aware of, and attempt a Perception check against that target’s Will DC. If you succeed, you size up their fighting style, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws against that creature’s attacks (or a +2 circumstance bonus for a critical success). These benefits last until the end of your next turn.
