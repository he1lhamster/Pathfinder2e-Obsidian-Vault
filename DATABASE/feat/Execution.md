**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Night of the Gray Death|Night of the Gray Death]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Gray Gardener|Gray Gardener]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Harsh Judgment|Harsh Judgment]]; [[DATABASE/feat/Vigilante Dedication|Vigilante Dedication]]; member of the Gray Gardeners
**Requirements** You have condemned a foe with [[DATABASE/feat/Harsh Judgment|Harsh Judgment.]]

---
You swing wide, attempting to behead your condemned foe. Make a melee Strike against your condemned foe. If you hit, your condemned foe takes 8d6 extra precision damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the condemned foe is reduced to 0 Hit Points by the execution and requires a head to live, they die. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your Execution for 1 day.
