# Combat Grab <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Fighter</span><span class="item-trait">Press</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[DATABASE/archetype/Wrestler|Wrestler]]*, [[DATABASE/archetype/Zombie|Zombie]]*
**Requirements** You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.
* This archetype offers Combat Grab at a different level than displayed here.

---
You swipe at your opponent and grab at them. Make a melee Strike while keeping one hand free. If the Strike hits, you grab the target using your free hand. The creature remains [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] until the end of your next turn or until it [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]], whichever comes first.

## Archetype Use

This feat can be used for one or more Archetypes in addition to the listed Classes. When selected this way, the feat is not considered to have its class traits.

## Traits

**Press:**

Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can't use one when it's not your turn, even if you use the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ready|Ready]] activity.
