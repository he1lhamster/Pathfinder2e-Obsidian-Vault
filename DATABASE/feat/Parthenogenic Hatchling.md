# Parthenogenic Hatchling <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Lizardfolk</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]]

---
You were hatched from an unfertilized egg during hard times for your people, and you are a biological copy of your mother. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases. Each of your successful saving throws against a disease reduces its stage by 2, or by 1 for a virulent disease. Each critical success against an ongoing disease reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 for a virulent disease. You take damage only every 2 hours from thirst and every 2 days from starvation, rather than every hour and every day.
**Special** You can take this feat only at 1st level.

## Traits

**Lizardfolk:**

These reptilian humanoids, also known as iruxi, are extremely adaptable and patient.
