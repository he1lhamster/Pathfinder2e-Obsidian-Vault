Combining necromancy with the mysterious temporal powers of clockwork, you wind a creature backward from the moment of its death. Attempt a DC 40 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Raise Dead|raise dead]], except it still has the [[DATABASE/condition/Wounded|wounded]] condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is then temporarily immune to Unwind Death for 1 day.
