You have heard the Call, and in constantly resisting that persistent demand, you've developed a mental bulwark against effects that would target your mind. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saving throws against mental effects. If you roll a success on your saving throw against a mental effect that would make you [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]], you get a critical success instead.
