# Malleable Form <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 13</span>

<span class="item-trait">Reflection</span><span class="item-trait">Transmutation</span>
**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
**Prerequisites** ability to cast at least one polymorph spell
**Requirements** You're polymorphed by a spell that has multiple choices of battle form.

---
You adroitly shift your form, taking on another appearance. Choose a different battle form of the polymorph spell affecting you, and change to that form instead of the current one. This destabilizes the spell's magic, reducing its duration by 1 round. Use the level of the spell to determine the statistics, as normal.
