---
Your elemental lineage manifests in the polished gleam of precious metals, such as silver and gold, or even rare and valuable skymetals like [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine|adamantine]] or [[DATABASE/equipment/Orichalcum|orichalcum]]. This natural luster enhances your charm; you become trained in your choice of [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]]. If you would automatically become trained in both these skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. If you're trained in Society, you also gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Courtly Graces|Courtly Graces]] skill feat.

## Traits

**Lineage:**

A feat with this trait indicates a character's descendance from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat. You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of these feats.

**Talos:**

Taloses are [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Planar Scion|planar scions]] descended from [[DATABASE/monster/Zuhra|zuhras]].
