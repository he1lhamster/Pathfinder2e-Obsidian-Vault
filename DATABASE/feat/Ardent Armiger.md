# Ardent Armiger <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Hellknight Armiger]]
**Prerequisites** [[Hellknight Armiger Dedication]]

---
You have been trained to resist the manipulations of fiends, and your Hellknight discipline makes you difficult to influence. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against mental effects that specifically improve your attitude and to your Will DC against someone Coercing you, Demoralizing you, Making an Impression on you, or Making a Request of you.
 If a mental effect would compel you to act in a way that violates your Hellknight order’s tenets (as determined by the GM), you can attempt to break free from the effect as a reaction triggered by receiving the violating order, and you gain a new Will save against the effect. You can attempt this new save only once for a given effect, even if you are compelled to violate your order’s tenets multiple times.
