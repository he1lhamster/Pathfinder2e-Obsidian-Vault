## Traits

**Fetchling:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the fetchling ancestry. Fetchlings were once human, but generations of life on the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] have transformed them.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
