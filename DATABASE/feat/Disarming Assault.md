You attack with enough force to knock the weapon out of your foe's hands. Make a melee Strike; if you hit, you can attempt an [[Athletics]] check to [[Disarm]] that foe.

## Traits

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
