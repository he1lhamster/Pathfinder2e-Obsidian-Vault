---
You become trained in your choice of [[Deception]] or [[Diplomacy]] and in [[Lore]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to [[Lie]] or [[Impersonate]] to pass yourself off as a worshipper of [[Walkena]]. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.

## Bright Lion Dedication Leads To...

[[Blessing of the Sun Gods]], [[Elude the Divine]], [[Lion's Might]], [[Sun's Fury]], [[Warding Light]]
