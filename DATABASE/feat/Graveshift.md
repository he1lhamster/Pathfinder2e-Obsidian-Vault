---
The maggots inhabiting your body impart you with the knowledge to travel from grave to grave, drawing upon the mystical power of the labyrinthine network of magical warrens and tunnels that connect Everglut to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]. You can spend 10 minutes channeling this power to transport you and all target creatures or objects that are inside the grave you are standing in to a chosen grave you are aware of (unoccupied or occupied) within 100 miles. When you target an occupied or filled grave, you and all transported creatures and objects appear scattered aboveground around the targeted grave (or belowground in adjacent tunnels or passageways if available).

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Conjuration:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the conjuration school of magic, typically involving summoning, creation, teleportation, or moving things from place to place.

**Divine:**

This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Teleportation:**

Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.
