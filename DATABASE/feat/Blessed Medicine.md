**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Archetype** [[Undead Slayer]]
**Prerequisites** [[Undead Slayer Dedication]]
**Trigger** You fail a check to [[Treat Disease]] that was inflicted by an undead (such as ghoul fever or mummy rot).

Your experience battling undead has uniquely prepared you to fight the diseases they inflict on the survivors, and you know that leaving these maladies untreated for long will eventually lead to more undead. Reroll the failed check and use the new result.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
