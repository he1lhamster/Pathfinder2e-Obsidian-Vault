# Idol Threat <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 13</span>

<span class="item-trait">Tiefling</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Beastbrood|Beastbrood]]
**Requirements** You're holding something sacred or precious to a creature, such as a relic or personal depiction of their deity or a precious personal memento.

You brandish the precious object you're holding menacingly, at once mocking it and threatening its safety. Attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the creature whose precious item you threaten. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check to Demoralize, and on a success, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] for 1 round out of distraction for the object's safety and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 minute (or stupefied 2 on a critical success). These conditions are both in addition to the normal effects of Demoralize. The creature is then temporarily immune to any Idol Threat using that specific object for 1 day.
