Something about your presence causes creatures of your bloodline to, consciously or not, recognize you as one of their own, and you become inured to their tricks. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]], and [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks when interacting with creatures that have the trait corresponding to your bloodline, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception and saving throws against such creatures. For example, an [[DATABASE/sorcererbloodline/Aberrant|aberrant bloodline]] sorcerer would gain this benefit against creatures with the aberration trait. The GM is the final arbiter of which creatures match your bloodline.
