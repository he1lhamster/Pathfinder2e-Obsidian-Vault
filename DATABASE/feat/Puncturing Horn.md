While many kashrishi never use their horns for more than cracking open hard-shelled fruits or amplifying their psychic powers, you've practiced using yours offensively. You gain a horn unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your horn is in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] group and has the finesse and unarmed traits.
**Special** If you have the [[DATABASE/heritage/Xyloshi|xyloshi]] heritage, your horn instead deals 1d8 piercing damage.
