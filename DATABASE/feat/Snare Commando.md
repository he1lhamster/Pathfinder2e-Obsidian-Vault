# Snare Commando <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 9</span>

<span class="item-trait">Kobold</span>

**Prerequisites** [[Snare Crafting]]; expert in [[Deception]] or [[Intimidation]]
**Trigger** A creature fails or critically fails a save against your snare.

---
Your snares are so befuddling that your victims rarely notice you slipping out of sight. If you have expert proficiency in [[Deception]], you can [[Create a Diversion]] against the triggering creature. If you have expert proficiency in [[Intimidation]], you can instead [[Demoralize]] the triggering creature. If you have both, choose one of the two effects.
