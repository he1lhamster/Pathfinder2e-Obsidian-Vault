Your snares are so befuddling that your victims rarely notice you slipping out of sight. If you have expert proficiency in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]], you can [[DATABASE/action/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] against the triggering creature. If you have expert proficiency in [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]], you can instead [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the triggering creature. If you have both, choose one of the two effects.
