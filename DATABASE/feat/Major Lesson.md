Your patron grants you even greater secrets. Choose a major, greater, or basic lesson. You gain its associated hex, and your familiar learns the associated spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
**Special** You can select this feat a second time if you're 14th level or higher, and a third time if you're 18th level or higher. Choose a different lesson each time.
