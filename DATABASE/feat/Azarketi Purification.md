You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Purify Food and Drink|purify food and drink]] as a primal innate spell, but only on liquids. You can cast this spell once every 10 minutes. You can also use your innate _purify food and drink_ on a touched creature instead of a liquid to purify their blood, giving that creature a +2 status bonus for 1 minute on their ongoing saves against poisons already present in their body when you cast the spell.
