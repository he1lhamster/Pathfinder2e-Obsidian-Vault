**Trigger** An enemy within 60 feet uses an ability that has the trait corresponding to your deviation damage type.

---
Your connection to energy is so much stronger than the offending display in front of you, allowing you to claim it for yourself. Attempt a counteract check against the triggering effect as you draw it into your body. If you successfully counteract the ability, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double the counteract level of the ability, which last for 1 minute.
**Awakening** The energy you consume helps empower your abilities. The next ability from the dragon classification that you use increases its range by 30 feet if it has a range, or increases its area by 10 feet if it's a cone or line. If you don't use this benefit within 1 minute, it fades.
**Awakening** You channel some of the seized energy into your next attack. Choose one of your weapons or unarmed attacks. Until the end of your next turn, Strikes with the chosen weapon or unarmed attack deal an additional 1d6 damage of a type matching the energy you consumed.

## Traits

**Abjuration:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the abjuration school of magic, typically involving protection or wards.

**Deviant:**

This trait describes strange supernatural or paranormal abilities.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
 Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
