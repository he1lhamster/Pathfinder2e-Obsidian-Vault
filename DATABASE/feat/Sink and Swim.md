Your body looks like it's made of flowing water, clear and pristine, providing a natural grace to all your movements. You gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you already had a swim Speed, it's increased by 10 feet. You gain the Water Transfer activity, which enables you to teleport through a body of water.
 **Water Transfer** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (conjuration, primal, teleportation, water) **Frequency** once per minute; **Requirements** You're on land and adjacent to a body of water; **Effect** You sink into the water and emerge back onto land in another space within 120 feet that's adjacent to the same body of water. You can transport yourself, any items you're wearing and holding, and up to one other willing creature.

## Traits

**Aftermath:**

This trait describes feats that represent special abilities gained after exposure to the weird and deadly.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Water:**

Effects with the water trait either manipulate or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a magical connection to the element. Planes with this trait are mostly liquid, perhaps with pockets of breathable air.
