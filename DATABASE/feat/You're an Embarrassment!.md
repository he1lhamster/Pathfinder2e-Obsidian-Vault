---
Some Firebrands can't stand it when their allies are ruining their moment, and you're no different. Your loud and forceful condemnation of an ally succumbing to an incapacitation effect gives them a second chance to impress you and shake off the effect. Your ally rerolls the triggering Will saving throw with a +1 circumstance bonus. Regardless of the result of the save, your ally is temporarily immune to You're an Embarrassment! for 10 minutes.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
