<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]
**Access** A character who is a member of the Pathfinder Society has access to this option.
**Trigger** You fail, but don’t critically fail, an attempt to [[Disable a Device]] on a trap.

---
You intentionally set off the trap, but you take special precautions to protect yourself and your allies from the trap’s effects. For the next 2 rounds, if the trap rolls a critical success on an attack roll, it gets a normal success instead, and if anyone rolls a critical failure on their saving throw against the trap, they get a normal failure instead.
