You enter a stance that lets you throw [[Shuriken]] with lightning speed. While in this stance, you can use your monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed attacks with shuriken instead.

## Traits

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
