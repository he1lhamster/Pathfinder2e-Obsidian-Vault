You siphon the destructive energies of positive or negative energy through a melee attack and into your foe. Make a melee Strike and add the spell’s damage to the Strike’s damage. This is negative damage if you expended a [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] spell or positive damage if you expended a [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]] spell. The spell is expended with no effect if your Strike fails or hits a creature that isn’t damaged by that energy type (such as if you hit a non-undead creature with a _heal_ spell).
