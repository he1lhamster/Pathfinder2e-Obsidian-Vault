You focus your mind on thoughtforms of fundamental magical forces, shaping them into a property rune that you mentally etch onto your mind weapon. During your daily preparations, choose one rune from the following list of weapon property runes: [[DATABASE/equipment/Corrosive|corrosive]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|disrupting]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Flaming|flaming]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost|frost]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Shock|shock]], and [[DATABASE/equipment/Thundering|thundering]]. You enhance your weapon with the chosen rune until your next daily preparations. This rune counts toward your maximum limit of runes as normal.
