The spell you deliver tries to force out magic affecting your enemy. Make a Spellstrike. If it hits, you also attempt to counteract a single spell (of your choice) active on the target. The counteract level is half your level rounded up, and the counteract check modifier is the standard modifier for counteracting with a spell (your Intelligence modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus, plus any bonuses or penalties that specifically apply to counteract checks).
