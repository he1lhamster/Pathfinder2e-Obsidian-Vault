You perform a bewildering show of prowess, such as by whirling and flashing a weapon, that unnerves foes. Attempt Intimidation checks to [[Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet. If your last action was a critical hit against an enemy or reduced an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your Intimidation checks. Regardless of the results of your checks, each creature is then temporarily immune to Dazzling Display for 1 minute.
