**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/action/Exploit Vulnerability|Exploit Vulnerability]]
**Trigger** The target of your Exploit Vulnerability is within 120 feet and uses a teleportation effect.
**Requirements** You are benefiting from Exploit Vulnerability.

---
You can hunt your foe to the ends of creation. You teleport along with the enemy, appearing the same direction and distance from it as you were before it teleported (or the nearest unoccupied space if your destination is occupied). Any allies affected by [[DATABASE/feat/Share Weakness|Share Weakness]] or [[DATABASE/feat/Ubiquitous Weakness|Ubiquitous Weakness]], if you have those abilities, can spend their reaction to teleport along with the enemy if they're within 120 of the enemy and choose to do so.

## Traits

**Conjuration:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the conjuration school of magic, typically involving summoning, creation, teleportation, or moving things from place to place.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Teleportation:**

Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.
