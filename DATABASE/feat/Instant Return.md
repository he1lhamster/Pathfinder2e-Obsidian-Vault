With a single fluid gesture, you catch a projectile out of the air, load it in your weapon, and shoot it back at the attacker. Interact to load the projectile into your weapon, then make a Strike with the required weapon against the triggering opponent. Since you're using the foe's ammunition, this Strike applies any special effects that ammunition would have (for instance, if it was [[DATABASE/equipment/Explosive Ammunition|explosive ammunition]], it would explode in a burst of fire if your Strike hits).
