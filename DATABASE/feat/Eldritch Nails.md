Your nails are supernaturally long and sharp. You gain a nails unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage. Your nails are in the [[Brawling]] group and have the agile and unarmed traits. You can etch your nails with runes with the same cost and restrictions as for etching runes onto [[Handwraps of Mighty Blows]]; runes etched onto your nails apply to nails unarmed attacks with both hands but not to other unarmed attacks.
 You can deliver hexes through your nails. When you successfully cast a non-cantrip hex that requires 2 actions or more to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a nails Strike against the foe before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect.
