Some rebel Firebrand cells make a practice of publicly declaring the main target of a given operation. You announce your intention to kill your mark for all to hear and reveal the reason they must die, perhaps listing their crimes or sharing a damning secret. Creatures within 30 feet who can see and hear you are shocked by your proclamation or otherwise reluctant to come to your mark's aid. They must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the creature can't attack you or otherwise perform hostile actions against you until the end of your next turn. If you use a hostile action against a creature other than your mark, this effect ends. Your mark becomes temporarily immune to your Public Execution for 1 day.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Auditory:**

Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deaf]] targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.

**Flourish:**

Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Linguistic:**

An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
