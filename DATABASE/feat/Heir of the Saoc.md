In the past, you would have been a proud initiate of the Saoc Brethren. Today, you carry on their legacy. When you use Saoc Astrology, roll 1d4 instead; on a 1, you take a –1 penalty to the skill check. On any other result, you gain a circumstance bonus of that value (for instance, a +3 circumstance bonus on a 3).
