Your spell reaches into the mind of a creature and removes you from it. The amped cantrip must be one that has one or more targets and must either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw. Use this amp in place of the psi cantrip's normal amp entry.

---
**Amp** Choose one target of the spell or one creature in its area. If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] by that creature, disappearing from its senses for 1 minute or until you use a hostile action. This is similar to being [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], but effects like [[DATABASE/spell/See Invisibility|see invisibility]] don't reveal you—you're affecting the target's mind, not its vision. [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|True seeing]] can still see through this illusion if the counteract check succeeds.

## Traits

**Amp:**

An amp is a special thoughtform that modifies the properties of your psi cantrips. Psi cantrips each have their own amp, and feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps.

**Illusion:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the illusion school of magic, typically involving false sensory stimuli.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.
