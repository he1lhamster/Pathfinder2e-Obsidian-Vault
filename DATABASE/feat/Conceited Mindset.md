Because you know your mind is superior, you scoff at anyone who would alter your mental state—but this hubris gets the better of you when you're wrong. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against mental effects. If you succeed at a save against a mental effect, you critically succeed instead; similarly, if you fail at a save against a mental effect, you critically fail instead.

## Traits

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
