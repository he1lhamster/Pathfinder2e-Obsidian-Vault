You've uncovered basic thaumaturgy. You become trained in thaumaturge class DC. Choose an implement; you can use it to Glimpse Vulnerability, but don't gain its benefits. You also gain a few esoterica, allowing you to use esoterica actions. You become trained in your choice of [[Arcana]], [[Nature]], [[Occultism]], or [[Religion]]; if you were already trained in these, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the Glimpse Vulnerability action.
 **Glimpse Vulnerability** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (esoterica, manipulate); **Frequency** once per round; **Requirement** You are holding your implement; **Effect** You glimpse a hidden vulnerability and then strengthen it to aid you. Select a creature you can see. Until you Glimpse Vulnerability again, that target gains weakness 2 against your unarmed and weapon Strikes.
