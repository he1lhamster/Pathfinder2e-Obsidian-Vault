Your hardiness lets you withstand more punishment than most before going down. Increase your maximum Hit Points by your level. When you have the [[Dying]] condition, the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value (instead of 10 + your dying value).
If you also have the [[Toughness]] feat, the Hit Points gained from it and this feat are cumulative, and the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 6 + your dying value.
