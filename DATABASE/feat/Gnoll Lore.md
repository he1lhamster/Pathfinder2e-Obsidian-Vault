You paid attention to your senior hunters to learn their tricks. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Gnoll Lore.
