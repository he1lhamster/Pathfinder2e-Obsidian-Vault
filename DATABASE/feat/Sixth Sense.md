Your psychic abilities also allow you to detect the lingering thoughts of spirits and similar entities. While you're exploring but not [[Search]], the GM rolls a secret check for you to find haunts that usually require Searching, as well as spirits, creatures on the [[Ethereal Plane]], and beings made entirely of spiritual essence, such as celestials, fiends, and monitors.
 You can also potentially notice [[Ethereal]] creatures and spirits inside solid objects, provided they are within 30 feet of you. This applies while Searching, [[Seek]], and on the automatic secret check from Sixth Sense. You can still notice spirits only on a successful check, and you can't see them if they're more than 5 feet inside an object.
 When you notice a creature with your Sixth Sense, you also learn its location, making it [[Hidden]] to you if it had been [[Undetected]].
