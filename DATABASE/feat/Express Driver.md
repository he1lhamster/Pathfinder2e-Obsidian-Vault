You can optimize your vehicle's performance, coaxing extra speed and choosing paths to avoid slowdowns. When calculating your travel speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Driving Lore]] check to increase your vehicle's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your vehicle's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters.

## Traits

**Exploration:**

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill.
