You dig deeper into the magical tools found in wizard schools and divine domains. You gain an advanced focus spell, either the [[DATABASE/wizardarcaneschool/Necromancy|necromancer]] advanced school spell [[DATABASE/spell/Life Siphon|life siphon]] or the advanced domain spell of the [[DATABASE/domain/Death Domain|death domain]], [[DATABASE/spell/Eradicate Undeath|eradicate undeath]]. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. If you choose _life siphon_, it triggers when you expend spell slots from your class even if they aren't wizard spell slots.
**Special** You can select this feat a second time, choosing the other advanced focus spell.
