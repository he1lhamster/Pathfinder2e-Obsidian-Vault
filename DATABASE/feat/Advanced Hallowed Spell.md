<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Archetype** [[Hallowed Necromancer]]
**Prerequisites** [[Necromancy]] initial school spell or [[Death Domain]] initial domain spell; [[Hallowed Necromancer Dedication]]

---
You dig deeper into the magical tools found in wizard schools and divine domains. You gain an advanced focus spell, either the [[Necromancy]] advanced school spell [[Life Siphon]] or the advanced domain spell of the [[Death Domain]], [[Eradicate Undeath]]. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. If you choose _life siphon_, it triggers when you expend spell slots from your class even if they aren't wizard spell slots.
**Special** You can select this feat a second time, choosing the other advanced focus spell.
