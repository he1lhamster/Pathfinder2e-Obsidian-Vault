The seasons shift rapidly. This impulse affects a cube 100 feet in each dimension within 1,000 feet. Choose the starting season. The impulse lasts for 4 rounds, proceeding to the next season at the start of each of your turns. You can't use this impulse again until the previous one ends.
 **Spring** Each ally in the cube gains 20 temporary HP that last until the start of your next turn. Any [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]] ally rolls a recovery check, but can't get worse than a success.
 **Summer** (light) Each enemy in the area is exposed to sunlight and must attempt a Reflex save against your class DC. It's unaffected on a critical success, [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazed]] until the start of your next turn on a success, or [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] until the start of your next turn on a failure.
 **Autumn** Leaves and rain make everything in the area [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] until the start of your next turn, and a cold wind makes each enemy in the area [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] until the start of your next turn unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your class DC.
 **Winter** Each enemy in the aura takes 5d6 cold damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save also takes 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent cold damage]].

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Wood:**

Effects with the wood trait conjure or manipulate wood. Those that manipulate wood have no effect in an area without wood. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of wood or have a connection to magical wood.
