---
You infuse a spell with the power of your faith, consecrating it. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that targets a single undead, you can expend a Focus Point, channeling the power of your focus spells into the primary spell. If you do, the spell you cast deals additional good or positive damage (your choice) equal to the level of your focus spells. As normal for additional damage, this additional damage is doubled if the spell cast requires an attack roll and the result of the attack roll is a critical hit, or if the spell cast requires a saving throw and the result of the saving throw is a critical failure.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
