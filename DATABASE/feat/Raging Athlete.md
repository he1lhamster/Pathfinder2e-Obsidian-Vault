Physical obstacles can't hold back your fury. While you are raging, you gain a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to your land Speed and the DC of [[High Jump]] and [[Long Jump]] decreases by 10. Your distance for a vertical [[Leap]] increases to 5 feet vertically, and your distance for a horizontal Leap increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet and to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.
