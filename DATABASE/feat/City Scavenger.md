You know that the greatest treasures often look like refuse, and you scoff at those who throw away perfectly good scraps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Subsist|Subsist]], and you can use [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] when you Subsist in a settlement.
 When you Subsist in a city, you also gather valuable junk that silly longshanks threw away. You can [[DATABASE/action/Earn Income|Earn Income]] using Society or Survival in the same time as you Subsist, without spending any additional days of downtime. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this check.
**Special** If you have the irongut goblin heritage, increase the bonuses to +2.
