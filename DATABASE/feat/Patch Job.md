You can patch up damage to an object with a quick fix. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Improvised Repair|Improvised Repair]] general feat. When you use Improvised Repair, you can attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check with the same DC as [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repair]]. If you succeed, you can use the object as a normal object of its type until it takes damage rather than as a shoddy object of its type.
