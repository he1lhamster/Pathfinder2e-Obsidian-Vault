# Educated Assessment <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 12</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Secret</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]]

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Pathfinder Agent Dedication|Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]
**Access** A character who is a member of the Pathfinder Society has access to this option.

---
You attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about a creature, and the GM uses the same secret roll result against the creature’s [[DATABASE/action/Retributive Strike|Deception]] or [[DATABASE/action/Bear Hug|Stealth]] DC, giving you the information from a [[DATABASE/feat/Battle Assessment|Battle Assessment]]. You might get a different degree of success on the Recall Knowledge check than what you get for the Battle Assessment. If you have the Battle Assessment feat, you gain the effects of Educated Assessment whenever you Recall Knowledge (such as with the [[DATABASE/feat/Automatic Knowledge|Automatic Knowledge]] feat).
