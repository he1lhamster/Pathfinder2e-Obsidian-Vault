You've battled more undead than you care to remember, often with little time to prepare between foes, forcing you to rely on experience and muscle memory to guide your blade. Attempt a check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about an undead you can see and then Strike that undead. If your attempt to Recall Knowledge is successful, your Strike treats the target's resistances as 5 lower. The target is then immune to your Practiced Opposition for 24 hours.
