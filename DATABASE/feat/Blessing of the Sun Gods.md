The Old Sun Gods share their power with you. Select the [[DATABASE/domain/Ambition Domain|ambition]], [[DATABASE/domain/Cities Domain|cities]], [[DATABASE/domain/Darkness Domain|darkness]], [[DATABASE/domain/Dreams Domain|dreams]], [[DATABASE/domain/Family Domain|family]], [[DATABASE/domain/Fire Domain|fire]], [[DATABASE/domain/Freedom Domain|freedom]], [[DATABASE/domain/Healing Domain|healing]], [[DATABASE/domain/Moon Domain|moon]], [[DATABASE/domain/Passion Domain|passion]], or [[DATABASE/domain/Sun Domain|sun]] domain. You gain an initial domain spell for that domain. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] activity to pray to the Old Sun Gods; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your Bright Lion focus spells are divine spells; you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability score.
**Special** You can select this feat multiple times, selecting a different domain each time and gaining its domain spell.
