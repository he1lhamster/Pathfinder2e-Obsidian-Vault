The Old Sun Gods share their power with you. Select the [[Ambition Domain]], [[Cities Domain]], [[Darkness Domain]], [[Dreams Domain]], [[Family Domain]], [[Fire Domain]], [[Freedom Domain]], [[Healing Domain]], [[Moon Domain]], [[Passion Domain]], or [[Sun Domain]] domain. You gain an initial domain spell for that domain. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [[Refocus]] activity to pray to the Old Sun Gods; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your Bright Lion focus spells are divine spells; you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability score.
**Special** You can select this feat multiple times, selecting a different domain each time and gaining its domain spell.
