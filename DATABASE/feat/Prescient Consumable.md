---
You can predict which consumables you might need in advance. When using [[Prescient Planner]], you can procure a consumable item from your [[Backpack]], instead of a piece of adventuring gear. The consumable item must still be common with a level no higher than half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it wouldn't have made you [[Encumbered]].

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.
