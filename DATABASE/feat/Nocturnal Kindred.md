You have an innate connection with other creatures of the night and understand some of them. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use [[Diplomacy]] with bats, rats, and wolves. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Make an Impression]] on such animals.
 Once per day, you can cast [[Animal Allies]] as a divine innate spell, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. The creatures it summons are bats, rats, and wolves. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened by an additional level, to a maximum of a 9th-level _animal allies_ when you are 19th level.
