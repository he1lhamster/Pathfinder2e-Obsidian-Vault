Your punches have incredible force and control. When you damage a target using [[One-Inch Punch]], you can focus your ki to send the foe flying. If you do, the target must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is pushed back 5 feet.
**Failure** The target is pushed back 10 feet.
**Critical Failure** The target is pushed back 10 feet for each action you spent on One-Inch Punch.
