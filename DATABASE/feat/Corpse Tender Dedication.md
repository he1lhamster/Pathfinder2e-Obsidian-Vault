You have a connection to mindless undead that allows you to communicate your intentions to them on a rudimentary level. You can use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make an Impression]] on mindless undead and to make very simple [[Request]] of them; their mindless trait doesn't grant immunity to these mental effects. Most mindless undead are likely [[Hostile]] toward you by default and must be kept at a safe distance to give you time to Make an Impression.
 You become trained in Diplomacy; if already trained, you instead become trained in another skill of your choice.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the corpse tender archetype.
