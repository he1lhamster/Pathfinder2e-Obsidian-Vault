## Traits

**Aura:**

An aura is an emanation that continually ebbs out from you, affecting creatures within a certain radius. Aura can also refer to the magical signature of an item or a creature with a strong alignment.

**Emotion:**

This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.
