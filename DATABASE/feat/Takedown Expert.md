You've mastered combat practices that let you get up close and bring down perpetrators alive. You can use your Intelligence modifier on attack rolls when you [[Devise a Stratagem]] if you're using a weapon of the [[Club]] group in one hand (like a [[Club]], [[Staff]], or [[Sap]]), in addition to the usual weapons, and those Strikes qualify for your strategic strike. Additionally, you can make any of your Strikes nonlethal without taking the normal –2 penalty.
