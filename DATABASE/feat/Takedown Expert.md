You've mastered combat practices that let you get up close and bring down perpetrators alive. You can use your Intelligence modifier on attack rolls when you [[DATABASE/action/Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Stratagem]] if you're using a weapon of the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Club|club]] group in one hand (like a [[DATABASE/weapon/Club|club]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Staff|staff]], or [[DATABASE/weapon/Sap|sap]]), in addition to the usual weapons, and those Strikes qualify for your strategic strike. Additionally, you can make any of your Strikes nonlethal without taking the normal –2 penalty.
