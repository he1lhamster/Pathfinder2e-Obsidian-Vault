---
Rebellions require an intricate knowledge of one's surroundings—because you might need to escape at any moment. You remember the locations of escape routes, ambush spots, and cover from a scouting expedition or a previous visit to the area. Roll a d20. At any point during the subsequent combat, you can substitute the result of this roll instead of rolling a d20 on one [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] or on one [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]].

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
