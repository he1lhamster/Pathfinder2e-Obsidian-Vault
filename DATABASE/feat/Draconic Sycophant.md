---
You have an affect that dragonkind find unusually pleasing—and when that fails, you know when to duck. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks and saving throws against dragons. In addition, whenever you meet a creature with the dragon trait in a social situation, you can attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on that creature immediately, rather than after conversing for 1 minute; you take a –5 penalty to this check. If you fail, you can choose to engage in 1 minute of conversation and then attempt a new check rather than accept the failure or critical failure result.
**Special** If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Glad-Hand|Glad-Hand]] skill feat, you don't take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target has the dragon trait.
