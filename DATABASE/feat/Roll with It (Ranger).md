**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Giant Hunter|Giant Hunter]]
**Trigger** Your hunted prey, which must be a giant, hits you with a melee attack.

---
You can dodge attacks from giants. Attempt a Reflex save using 10 + the giant's attack bonus as the save DC. If the result allows you to Stride as part of the reaction, you may instead [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]] or [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]] if you have the corresponding movement type.
**Critical Success** The attack misses you (or if the attack was a critical hit, it becomes a regular hit). You can Stride up to 10 feet as part of the reaction; if you do so, the reaction gains the move trait.
**Success** The attack deals half damage. You can Stride up to 5 feet as part of the reaction, but you must end this movement adjacent to the triggering giant. If you do so, the reaction gains the move trait.
**Critical Failure** You fail to avoid the attack and are knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] by the blow.

## Traits

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

### Adventuring with Ekundayo

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
Ekundayo eventually develops his own methods to pursue his favored enemies—giants. Once he gains the Magical Crafting feat at 4th level, he begins to craft specialized ammunition and runes for weapons. As long as his attitude toward the PCs is at least friendly, he shares these discoveries with them, unlocking the following ranger class feats and items as soon as his level equals the level of the feat or item.
