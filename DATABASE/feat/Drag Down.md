While swimming in water at least 10 feet deep, you grab an adjacent creature (on nearby land or in the water) and pull it below the surface. Attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] the creature. On a success, if the creature is on land, in addition to the normal effects of Grapple, you pull the creature into the water in a space adjacent to you. If the creature is already in the water, on a success, in addition the normal effects of Grapple, you drag the creature 10 feet deeper into the water, moving 10 feet with the creature. Moving a creature into water or deeper into water using Drag Down is forced movement for the creature but not for you.
