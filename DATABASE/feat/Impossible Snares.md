You can create endless shorter-lived snares, protecting your lair or using them against foes. Once per minute, you can [[DATABASE/action/Craft|Craft]] one of the snares you've prepared for quick deployment without expending the prepared snare. Once deployed, such a snare lasts for 10 minutes before losing its effectiveness.
