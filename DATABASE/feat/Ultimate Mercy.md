Your mercy transcends the bounds of life and death. When you use Mercy, you can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Lay on Hands|lay on hands]] on a creature that died since your last turn to return it to life. The target returns to life with 1 hit point and becomes wounded 1. You can’t use Ultimate Mercy if the triggering effect was [[DATABASE/spell/Disintegrate|disintegrate]] or a death effect.
