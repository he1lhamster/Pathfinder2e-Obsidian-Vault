**Prerequisites** expert in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]]; living creature, ability to cast 6th-level or higher spells from spell slots, completed ritual to become a lich and crafted a _soul cage_

---
After years of study and careful planning, you finally completed a _soul cage_ to house your soul and successfully performed a ritual to transform yourself into a lich. Now, neither death nor time can prevent you from pursuing your studies and achieving your grand ambitions. You gain the undead trait and the basic undead benefits. Your undead craving is for knowledge.
 You gain a unique [[DATABASE/equipment/Soul Cage|soul cage]]—a magic item that houses your soul. Whenever you would die, your soul flees to the _soul cage_ to allow you to be rebuilt. As long as your soul cage exists, you can't truly be destroyed.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the lich archetype.

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Dedication:**

You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
