You often find that the best way to win a conflict means avoiding a fight in the first place. You're good at talking to potential opponents without making things worse. If you would critically fail at a check to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], you instead fail. You can attempt checks to make [[DATABASE/action/Request|Requests]] of creatures who're [[DATABASE/condition/Indifferent|indifferent]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Unfriendly|unfriendly]] toward you.
