Your blood becomes thick and sluggish, but no less effective at oxygenating your cells. You can selectively stop your bleeding with ease. Reduce the DC of flat checks to stop [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] from 15 to 10, and you can use a single action that has the concentrate trait to gain an early flat check without physically binding the wounds. You recover from the [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]] condition twice as quickly as normal.
