<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Spell Trickster|Spell Trickster]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Spell Trickster Dedication|Spell Trickster Dedication]]; ability to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Grease|grease]]

---
When you cast _grease_, you can modify its target to be 1 creature. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You splash the target with combustible grease. The target must attempt a Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is splattered with grease and gains weakness 2 to fire until the end of your next turn. The target or an adjacent creature can rub off the combustible grease with an Interact action, ending the effect.
**Failure** As success, except the weakness to fire lasts for 1 minute.

---
**Heightened (+2)** The weakness increases by 1.
