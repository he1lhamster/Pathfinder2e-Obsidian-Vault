You’ve sworn an oath to hunt down wicked evildoers and bring them to judgment. Add the following tenet to your code after the others: “You must hunt down and exterminate evil creatures that have committed heinous atrocities as long as you have a reasonable chance of success and aren’t engaged in a mission that would prevent your doing so.”
 You can use [[DATABASE/spell/Lay on Hands|lay on hands]] to damage a creature you witness harming an innocent or a good ally as if it were undead; in this case, lay on hands deals good damage instead of positive damage and gains the good trait. This good damage can affect non-evil creatures. This doesn’t prevent you from healing such a creature with _lay on hands_; you choose whether to heal or harm.
