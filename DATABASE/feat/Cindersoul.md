The fire of your elemental ancestor manifests like dying embers of a blaze, and your inner charcoal helps staunch bleeding, purify simple poisons, and absorb acid. The DC for you to recover from [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent acid, bleed, and poison damage]] is 10 instead of 15 (or 5 if you have particularly effective assistance).
