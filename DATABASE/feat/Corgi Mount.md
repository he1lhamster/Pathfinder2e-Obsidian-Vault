# Corgi Mount <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

---
The smallest of fey have ridden corgis as mounts since time immemorial, leading to a pattern on corgis' backs called a “faerie saddle.” You have formed a magical connection with a corgi that can serve as your mount. Your corgi familiar is Small rather than Tiny, and it's appropriate for use as your mount, unlike most familiars. It has the [[DATABASE/familiarability/Scent|scent]] ability, which counts against your limit for familiar and master abilities as normal. Furthermore, it can never gain a familiar ability that grants it any Speeds other than a land Speed. If you're a [[DATABASE/heritage/Pixie|pixie]], you can't ride a corgi due to your Size, but you can take this feat to gain a corgi familiar.
