---
Now's your chance! You're a Firebrand, and the world must know it. You strike a dramatic pose, deliver a snappy quip, or reveal a shocking new costume, captivating everyone who can see you. You don't roll initiative. Instead, you voluntarily go last. Enemies who can see you must attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the enemy is overcome with anticipation for what you'll do next on the battlefield and becomes [[Stunned]] (stunned 2 on a critical failure). As your first action on your first turn, you can Interact to draw or stow an item of light Bulk as a free action; if this item is a small garment or accessory, such as a fan, a pair of gloves, or a wine glass, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based skill checks until the end of your turn.
