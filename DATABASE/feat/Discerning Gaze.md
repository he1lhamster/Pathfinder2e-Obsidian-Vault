You have a sense for when people are lying. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your secret Perception checks to [[Sense Motive]]. 
If you use [[Sense Motive]] on a creature you have currently condemned with [[Harsh Judgment]], your GM rolls the Perception check twice and takes the higher result (this is a fortune effect).
