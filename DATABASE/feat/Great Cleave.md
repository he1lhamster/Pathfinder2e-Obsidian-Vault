---
Your fury carries your weapon through multiple foes. When you [[Cleave]], if your Strike also kills or knocks the target unconscious, you can continue to make melee Strikes until you make a Strike that doesn’t kill or knock a creature unconscious, or until there are no creatures adjacent to the most recent creature you attacked while Cleaving, whichever comes first.

## Traits

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
