You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations. A spellcaster using [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Read Aura|read aura]] must succeed at a Perception check against your [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] DC to see through your obfuscations.
