Your Spellstrike sweeps are so wide and devastating, they splash onto nearby foes. Make a Spellstrike. Foes adjacent to the target take splash damage equal to 2 + the extra damage from Arcane Cascade. The damage type is the same as Arcane Cascade; if the spell already deals splash damage of the same type, combine the damage together before applying weaknesses or resistances.
