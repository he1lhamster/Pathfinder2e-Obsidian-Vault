Although you may not even be aware, the [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Alghollthu|alghollthus]] your ancestors once served maintain a stranglehold on the deepest, tethered parts of your mind. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to Will saves against mental effects that would make you [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]], and if you roll a success against such an effect, you get a critical success instead. However, you gain none of these benefits against effects originating from alghollthus and instead take a –2 circumstance penalty against mental effects from alghollthus.
