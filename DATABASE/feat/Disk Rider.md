# Disk Rider <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Spell Trickster|Spell Trickster]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Spell Trickster Dedication|Spell Trickster Dedication]]; ability to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Floating Disk|floating disk]]

When you cast _floating disk_, you can modify its duration to be sustained, up to 10 minutes. If you do, add the following heightened entry to its effects.
**Heightened (3rd)** The disk can hold up to 10 Bulk. The spell no longer ends if you ride atop the disk (though it does if any other creature rides atop it, including if the creature is riding on you). If you are riding the disk, it changes its capacity to hold you, plus additional Bulk equal to the maximum you could carry without being [[DATABASE/condition/Encumbered|encumbered]]. If you ride atop the disk, you can direct it to move along the ground up to 30 feet or your Speed, whichever is slower, each time you Sustain the Spell. While you ride atop it, the disk can move over liquids as long as it ends its movement on solid ground. If it ends its movement on a surface that can't support it, the spell ends.
