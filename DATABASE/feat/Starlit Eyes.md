Starlight shines in your sight, enhancing your perception and range. When you make a ranged Strike while in Arcane Cascade stance, you lower the DC of your flat check to target a creature that's [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from you. The DC is reduced to 3 instead of 5 against a concealed creature and to 9 instead of 11 against a hidden one. When you cast [[DATABASE/spell/Shooting Star|shooting star]] and target a hidden creature, you don't have to attempt the flat check for targeting a hidden creature with a ranged Strike.
