Your uttered prayers become an aegis, drawing the blessing of your deity across the surface of your shield. Until the beginning of your next turn your shield, any [[Shield Boss]], or [[Shield Spikes]] gain the effects of a [[Ghost Touch]] property rune. Additionally, damage you take as a result of an incorporeal creature's Strike can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.
