Your uttered prayers become an aegis, drawing the blessing of your deity across the surface of your shield. Until the beginning of your next turn your shield, any [[DATABASE/weapon/Shield Boss|shield boss]], or [[DATABASE/weapon/Shield Spikes|shield spikes]] gain the effects of a [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] property rune. Additionally, damage you take as a result of an incorporeal creature's Strike can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.
