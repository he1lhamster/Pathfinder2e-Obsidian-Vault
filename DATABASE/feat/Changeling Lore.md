All too aware of your true nature, you’ve studied hags and their powers. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Hag Lore]].
