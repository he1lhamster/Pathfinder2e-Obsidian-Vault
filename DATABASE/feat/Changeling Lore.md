<span class="item-trait">Changeling</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]]

---
All too aware of your true nature, you’ve studied hags and their powers. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Deception]] and [[Occultism]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[Lore]].

## Traits

**Changeling:**

A creature with this trait has the changeling versatile heritage. Changelings are the children of [[Hag]] and members of other humanoid ancestries. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by changelings.
