Your ability to blend into the background allows you to fade away entirely or appear innocuous even to magical effects. You gain [[DATABASE/spell/Invisibility|invisibility]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Misdirection|misdirection]] as 2nd-level innate occult spells. You can target only yourself with _invisibility_, and you must be the primary target of _misdirection_. You can cast each spell once per day.
