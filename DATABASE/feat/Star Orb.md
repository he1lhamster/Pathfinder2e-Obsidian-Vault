Your magic has crystallized into a spherical stone. You gain a familiar, except it's a star orb: a Tiny stone of light Bulk. The familiar has no Speeds and must select a Speed familiar ability before it can move, animating in a way appropriate to the chosen Speed and using the statistics of a normal familiar for that day; when it‘s an immobile stone, it can't select any familiar or master abilities that require it to move. It always has the [[DATABASE/familiarability/Innate Surge|innate surge]] master ability, which counts against your limit for familiar and master abilities.
