**Trigger** A creature within 60 feet is falling.

---
Air currents flow upward to slow the target's fall to 60 feet per round. The cushion ends when the target reaches the ground, and the creature takes no damage from the fall. The cushion expires if the creature doesn't reach the ground within 1 minute, but any distance it fell during that minute doesn't count for any damage the creature would take from the fall. You can't use Air Cushion again while you have one in effect.

---
**Level (8th)** The range is 120 feet, and you can create cushions for up to 5 falling creatures with one reaction.

## Traits

**Air:**

Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air with various degrees of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
