To you, crocodilians, giant lizards, and dinosaurs are loyal steeds, not monsters. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Ride|Ride]] feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] checks to Handle an Animal as long as the animal is a reptile, dinosaur, or even a non-sapient dragon.

## Traits

These reptilian humanoids, also known as iruxi, are extremely adaptable and patient.
