<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Cleric</span>

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Emblazon Armament|Emblazon Armament]]

Your sacred etchings imbue objects with power. It takes you only 1 minute to emblazon a symbol using [[DATABASE/feat/Emblazon Armament|Emblazon Armament]], and you can have up to four symbols emblazoned at a time. Each item can still have only one symbol emblazoned upon it, and if you exceed the limit of four, the oldest symbol disappears. These symbols can benefit even those who don’t follow the deity, provided they aren’t directly opposed (as determined by the GM).
 You can select a different benefit for each emblazoned symbol, chosen from any you have from Emblazon Armament or other feats such as [[DATABASE/feat/Emblazon Energy|Emblazon Energy]] or [[DATABASE/feat/Emblazon Antimagic|Emblazon Antimagic]].

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
