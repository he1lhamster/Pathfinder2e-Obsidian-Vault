Your features reshape into those of a type of fiend who serves your deity; for example, as a demon you might have putrid scales, twisted horns, and red eyes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. You gain darkvision if you don't already have it, and you gain the fiend trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor you've become (such as daemon, demon, or devil).

## Traits

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
