**Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points.

---
In a burst of flame, you return to health like a [[Phoenix]] rising from the ashes. Change your current Hit Points to 30 and cast a 6th-level [[Fireball]] centered on yourself. This fireball doesn't affect you. Your hair turns brilliant red for 1 hour.
 If you haven't used Ruby Resurrection and you die, you stay in initiative order and Ruby Resurrection triggers automatically at the start of your next turn, bringing you back to life at 0 HP before having its normal effects. This happens only if there are some remains to resurrect; for instance, if you were killed by [[Disintegrate]] you wouldn't return.
**Special** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast.

## Traits

**Healing:**

A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.

**Necromancy:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
