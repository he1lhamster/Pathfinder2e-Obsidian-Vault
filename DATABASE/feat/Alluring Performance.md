You command the attention of those around you with an elegant display. Attempt a Performance check and compare it to the Will DC of each creature in a 15-foot emanation.
**Critical Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] with you for as long as you perform (unless it breaks from the fascination, as normal for the condition) and is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round or as long as it's fascinated, whichever is longer.
**Success** The target is fascinated for 1 round and is dazzled for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is dazzled for 1 round.
**Critical Failure** The target is unaffected.

## Traits

**Incapacitation:**

An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Vishkanya:**

These faintly ophidian humanoids have venomous blood and saliva.

**Visual:**

A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.
