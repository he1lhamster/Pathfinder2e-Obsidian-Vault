The Sapphire Butterfly is not one for violence when simply intimidating a foe will do. From that vigilante's techniques, you've learned how to pull a deadly blow at the last moment, threatening your target instead of striking them. Rather than dealing damage with the triggering Strike, attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check with a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet who can see you. If you critically succeed at your check to Demoralize the target of your Strike, their attitude toward you improves by one step while they also become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 2]].

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Emotion:**

This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.

**Fear:**

Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Press:**

Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can't use one when it's not your turn, even if you use the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ready|Ready]] activity.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
