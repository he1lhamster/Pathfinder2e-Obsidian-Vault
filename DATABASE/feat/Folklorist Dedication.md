You are a master archivist and entertainer, capable of pulling wisdom from the tales you tell and weaving your allies and enemies into a powerful narrative. You gain the Spin Tale action. 
**Spin Tale** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (auditory, linguistic) **Frequency** once every 10 minutes; **Effect** You tell a story, designating one of your allies (but not yourself) as the hero of the story, and one enemy as the villain; both must be within 60 feet. The hero gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws against the villain until the start of your next turn. If you Spin a Tale on your next turn, the story continues for another round, for a maximum of 10 rounds. While the tale continues, minor, crude illusions spring into being in your space; these are arcane illusion effects that have no mechanical impact other than illustrating your tale.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the folklorist archetype.
