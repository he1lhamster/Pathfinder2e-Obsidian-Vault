Putting on a grim face for the battle ahead, you encourage your allies to strike fear into their foes with vicious attacks. When you use this action, attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.
**Critical Success** Your marshal's aura increases to a 20-foot emanation, and it grants you and allies a status bonus to damage rolls equal to the number of weapon damage dice of the unarmed attack or weapon you are wielding that has the most weapon damage dice. When you or an ally in the aura critically hits an enemy with a Strike, that enemy is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]].
**Success** As critical success, but your aura's size doesn't increase.
**Failure** You fail to enter the stance.
**Critical Failure** You fail to enter the stance and can't take this action again for 1 minute.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Open:**

These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an open only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
