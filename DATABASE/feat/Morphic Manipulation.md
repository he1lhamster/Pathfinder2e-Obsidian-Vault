You've attuned your natural aura to that of plant life, coaxing it to grow faster than normal. You sit for 10 minutes with a small, natural non-creature plant—such as a lone flower, a small bush, or a potted succulent—while you bring your aura in tune through meditation. You coax the plant to advance one stage in its life cycle: from seed to sprout, sprout to plant, plant to flower, or flower to fruit. If the plant doesn't have proper nutrients (if you're sprouting a seed without soil or water, for example), the plant withers 5 minutes after you complete the activity. Performing this activity more than once per day renders you [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] and unable to use Morphic Manipulation until your next full night's rest.

## Traits

**Exploration:**

An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Necromancy:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death.

**Positive:**

Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy. Planes with this trait are awash with life energy of such intensity that it can harm living creatures. Creatures with this trait are natives of the [[DATABASE/plane/Positive Energy Plane|Positive Energy Plane]]. They can survive the basic environmental effects of the Positive Energy Plane.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
