You're adept at noticing the tells of a liar—sweat, flushing, a quavering voice, a quickening pulse. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] and to Perception DCs against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]] to you. When you determine someone is lying to you, you can use their deceit to your advantage to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]], [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check you attempt against that creature within the next minute.
