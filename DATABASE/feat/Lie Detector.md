You're adept at noticing the tells of a liar—sweat, flushing, a quavering voice, a quickening pulse. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive]] and to Perception DCs against attempts to [[Lie]] to you. When you determine someone is lying to you, you can use their deceit to your advantage to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next [[Deception]], [[Diplomacy]], [[Intimidation]], or [[Performance]] check you attempt against that creature within the next minute.
