You can launch a mass of quills at opponents. You spray quills in a 30-foot cone, dealing 5d8 piercing damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. On a critical failure, a creature also takes 5 [[Persistent Damage]]. At 11th level and every even level thereafter, the piercing damage increases by 1d8 and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1.
