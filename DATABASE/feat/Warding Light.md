You gain a tattoo that serves as a special ward to defend you against [[DATABASE/deity/Walkena|Walkena's]] forces. The tattoo allows you to cast the [[DATABASE/spell/Light|light]] cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. The cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. If you die, the tattoo immediately casts [[DATABASE/spell/Gentle Repose|gentle repose]] on your corpse, heightened to the same spell level.
