Ragged pieces of metal weld together into a ramshackle structure. The barricade is up to 30 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1/2 inch thick. It must form in a straight line in an unbroken open space that doesn't pass through any creatures or objects, or the impulse fails. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 20 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. If any section is destroyed, the entire wall collapses, and each creature adjacent to the wall takes 2d8 slashing damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The wall lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute.

---
**Level (+2)** The maximum length of the wall increases by 10 feet, the HP of each section increases by 10, and the damage when it's destroyed increases by 1d8.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Metal:**

Effects with the metal trait conjure or manipulate metal. Those that manipulate metal have no effect in an area without metal. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of metal or have a connection to magical metal.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
