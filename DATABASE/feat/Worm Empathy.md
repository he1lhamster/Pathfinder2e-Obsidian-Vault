You can connect with [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Cave Worm|cave worms]] (and other worm-related creatures, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on cave worms and to make simple [[DATABASE/action/Request|Requests]] of them. In most cases, the cave worm's starting attitude is indifferent and they will give you time to establish contact.
