You can connect with [[Cave Worm]] (and other worm-related creatures, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make an Impression]] on cave worms and to make simple [[Request]] of them. In most cases, the cave worm's starting attitude is indifferent and they will give you time to establish contact.
