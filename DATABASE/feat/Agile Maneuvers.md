Your easily maneuver against your foes. Your [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]], [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]], and [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] actions have a lower multiple attack penalty: –4 instead of –5 if they're the second attack on your turn, or –8 instead of –10 if they're the third or subsequent attack on your turn.
