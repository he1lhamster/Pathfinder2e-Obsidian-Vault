Enormous pieces of rock cluster around your body. You can Dismiss this impulse.

* You become Large if you were smaller. This increases your reach by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny).
* You gain a climb Speed equal to your land Speed, but you can use it only to climb surfaces of earthen matter.
* The armor grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude saves and a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DCs against attempts to [[Shove]] you, [[Trip]] you, or knock you [[Prone]].
* If your Strength is below +4, this armor raises your Strength to +4. If your Strength is +4 or higher, this armor grants you a +1 item bonus to your Strength.
* If you have the [[Armor in Earth]] impulse, you can add its effects to Assume Earth's Mantle.

## Traits

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
