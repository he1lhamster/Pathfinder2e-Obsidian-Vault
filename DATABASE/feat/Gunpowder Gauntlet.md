Your flair keeps foes' attention, as your motions with your gun draw your foes into a deadly game. As you toy with them and performatively brandish your weapon, you build their tunnel vision, leaving them trapped in a perceptual gauntlet of your own making. Attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check against the Will DC of a single target within your one-handed firearm's first range increment.
**Critical Success** The target takes a –2 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you until the beginning of your next turn.
**Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you until the beginning of your next turn.
