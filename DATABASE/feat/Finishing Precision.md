You've learned how to land daring blows when you have panache. You gain the [[Swashbuckler]] but you deal 1 additional damage on a hit and 1d6 damage on a finisher. This damage doesn't increase as you gain levels. In addition, you gain the Basic Finisher action.
 **Basic Finisher** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (Finisher, Swashbuckler) You make a graceful, deadly attack. Make a Strike; if you hit and your weapon qualifies for precise strike, you deal the full 1d6 damage from precise strike.
