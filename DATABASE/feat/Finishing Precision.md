You've learned how to land daring blows when you have panache. You gain the [[DATABASE/class_/Swashbuckler|precise strike class feature]] but you deal 1 additional damage on a hit and 1d6 damage on a finisher. This damage doesn't increase as you gain levels. In addition, you gain the Basic Finisher action.
