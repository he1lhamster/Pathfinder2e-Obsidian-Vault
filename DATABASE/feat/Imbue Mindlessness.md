---
You grasp the mind of an undead creature and temporarily wipe it as empty as a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Zombie|zombie's]] brain. You can target any undead with your divine innate [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] spell, not just mindless undead. When you target one non-mindless undead creature with this spell, you can transform its effects. Instead of harm's normal effects, the target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is stupefied 2 for 1 minute. While it is stupefied, you can use your Corpse Tender feats on the target as though it were mindless.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is stupefied 3 for 10 minutes.
