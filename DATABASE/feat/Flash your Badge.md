You make a fearsome show of your authority. Roll Intimidation checks to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each creature in a 30-foot cone. When you do so, Demoralize gains the visual trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. If a target creature hasn't broken a law in the past week (as determined by the GM), the result of your check against that creature is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled.
