---
Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes studying your surroundings in search of omens related to a particular course of action to cast [[Augury]] as an innate divine spell. Unless the result of the _augury_ was “nothing,” you gain the following reaction for the next 30 minutes:

### [[Call Upon the Brightness]] <span class="action-icon">5</span>

**Trigger** You attempt an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw while performing the course of action from your _augury_, but you haven’t rolled yet

You gain a +1 status bonus to the triggering check, or a +2 status bonus if the result of the _augury_ was “woe” and you proceeded anyway.
