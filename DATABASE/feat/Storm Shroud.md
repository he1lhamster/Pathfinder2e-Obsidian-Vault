You become surrounded by a swirling storm of rain, sand, snow, or clouds, whichever of those suits your bound terrain. This activity has traits appropriate to the storm you create— typically earth for sand and water for rain, snow, or clouds. You become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] for 1 minute. You can't use this concealment to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]] or [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]], as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.
