# Sword and Pistol <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Gunslinger</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Archetype** [[Pistol Phenom]]*
* This archetype offers Sword and Pistol at a different level than displayed here.

---
You're comfortable wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand and a melee weapon in the other, combining melee attacks with shots from the firearm. When you make a successful ranged Strike against an enemy within your reach with your one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow, that enemy is [[Flat-Footed]] against your next melee attack with a one-handed melee weapon.
 When you make a successful melee Strike against an enemy with your one-handed melee weapon, the next ranged Strike you make against that enemy with a one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack but not a melee attack, such as [[Attack of Opportunity]]. Either of these benefits is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.
