# Chance Death <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Duskwalker</span><span class="item-trait">Fortune</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Ancestry Guide|Ancestry Guide]] 
**Frequency** once per day
**Trigger** You would die as a result of a failed saving throw or recovery check.

---
Your previous life ended due to sheer poor luck, struck by lightning or choking on a fish bone. You can reroll the triggering recovery check or saving throw, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse than the first roll.
**Special** You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.

## Traits

**Duskwalker:**

A creature with this trait has the duskwalker versatile heritage. Duskwalkers are planar scions infused with the supernatural energy of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomps]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by duskwalkers.

**Fortune:**

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
