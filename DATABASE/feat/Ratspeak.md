To you, the squeaking of rats and other rodents makes a strange kind of sense. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the [[Diplomacy]] skill with rodents, including beavers, mice, porcupines, rats, and squirrels, but not with other mammals, such as dogs or bats. The GM determines which animals count as rodents.
