When you trick a foe, instead of catching them off guard, you goad them into overextending their next attack. On a successful [[Feint]], you can use the following success and critical success effects instead of any other effects that would occur when you Feint. You can choose a different effect each time you Feint against a given foe.
**Critical Success** The target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to all attack rolls against you before the end of its next turn.
**Success** The target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its next attack roll against you before the end of its next turn.
