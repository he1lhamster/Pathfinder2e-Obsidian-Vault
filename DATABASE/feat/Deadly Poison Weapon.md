Famous not only for its pesh cash crop and the host of medicinal plants that grow naturally in the nearby desert, but also for the consistent demand for efficient toxins, Katapesh has developed its own specialized poisons and toxic techniques. The city's infamous Poison Maker's Guild is the source of many of these concoctions as well as secret techniques for using them, though unscrupulous Katapeshi bodyguards, thieves, and assassins all know at least one poison recipe or a unique means of inflicting such toxins.
