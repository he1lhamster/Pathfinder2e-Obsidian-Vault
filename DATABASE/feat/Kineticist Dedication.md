**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
**Archetype** [[Kineticist]]
**Prerequisites** Constitution +2

---
You become trained in kineticist class DC and impulse attack rolls. Choose one element to be your kinetic element (air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood). You gain a kinetic aura and the [[Channel Elements]] action, though you don't get to use an Elemental Blast or stance impulse when you take that action. You gain the [[Elemental Blast]] action. Your Elemental Blast does not automatically gain additional damage dice every four levels, instead requiring you to take the [[Improved Elemental Blast]] feat.

## Kineticist Dedication Leads To...

[[Base Kinesis]], [[Expert Kinetic Control]], [[Improved Elemental Blast]], [[Through the Gate]]
