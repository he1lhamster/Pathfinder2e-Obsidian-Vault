**Prerequisites** Constitution +2

You become trained in kineticist class DC and impulse attack rolls. Choose one element to be your kinetic element (air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood). You gain a kinetic aura and the [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]] action, though you don't get to use an Elemental Blast or stance impulse when you take that action. You gain the [[DATABASE/action/Elemental Blast|Elemental Blast]] action. Your Elemental Blast does not automatically gain additional damage dice every four levels, instead requiring you to take the [[DATABASE/feat/Improved Elemental Blast|Improved Elemental Blast]] feat.
