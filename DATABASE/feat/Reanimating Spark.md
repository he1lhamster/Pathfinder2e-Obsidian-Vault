# Reanimating Spark <span class="item-type">Feat 13</span>

<span class="item-trait">Poppet</span>
**Source** [[Grand Bazaar]]
**Frequency** once per day
**Trigger** You have the [[Dying]] condition and are about to attempt a recovery check.

---
The magic that animates you strains to keep you alive. You're restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the dying and [[Unconscious]] conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the [[Wounded]] condition as normal when losing the dying condition in this way.

## Traits

**Poppet:**

Small constructs originally designed to serve as companions or servants. They occasionally gain a greater spark of life, transforming them into independent, sapient creatures.
