A vortex of sand and dust surrounds you. Each creature inside your kinetic aura (including you) is [[Concealed]] from any creature outside your kinetic aura, and creatures outside the aura are concealed from creatures inside the aura other than you. Your air impulses carry sands that cut at great speed. When you use a damaging air impulse that affects at least one creature in your kinetic aura, that impulse deals 1 additional slashing damage, or 2 if the impulse has a single target.

**Level (+2)** The extra damage increases by 1, or 2 if the impulse has a single target.

## Traits

**Air:**

Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air with various degrees of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies.

**Composite:**

A composite impulse combines multiple elements. You can gain an impulse with the composite trait only if your kinetic elements include all the elements listed in the impulse's traits.

**Earth:**

Effects with the earth trait either manipulate or conjure earth. Those that manipulate earth have no effect in an area without earth. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of earth or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait are mostly solid, with caverns and other hollow pockets.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
