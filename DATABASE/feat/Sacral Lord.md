By right of ritual or sheer stubbornness, you have claimed rulership of the land. Claim a defined territory, such as a small section of forest or river, or a district of a larger city. Within its borders, you can cast [[Detect Magic]], [[Guidance]], and [[Sigil]] as innate divine cantrips, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Make an Impression]] on creatures that have the celestial, fiend, fey, monitor, or spirit traits.
**Special** You and your land are linked. Changes to one mirror themselves on the other—if you're depressed, gray rain and clammy mist might set in. These effects have no immediate mechanical impact, but they might give clues about problems afflicting the land.

## Traits

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
