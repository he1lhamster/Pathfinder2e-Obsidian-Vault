Any necromancer can create [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Zombie|zombie]] and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Skeleton|skeleton]], but you know the secrets behind the creation of far more advanced undead monstrosities. You learn the [[DATABASE/ritual/Create Undead|create undead]] rituals to create two types of common undead for which you meet the prerequisites. (Your GM might give you access to additional types of undead.) You can't teach these rituals to anyone else and you can't participate in either ritual while allowing someone else to serve as the primary caster unless they also know the ritual. When you reach a new level, you can change either or both of these rituals to a different type of undead for which you now meet the prerequisites.
 When acting as primary caster, you can perform all _create undead_ rituals in 4 hours instead of 1 day and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your primary check. You can also perform the ritual without the aid of a secondary caster, in which case you attempt the secondary check.
**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, you learn the rituals to create two more types of undead creatures.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
