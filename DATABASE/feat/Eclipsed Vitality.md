You're always taking precautions when [[DATABASE/action/Avoid Notice|Avoiding Notice]], [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hiding]], and [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneaking]] to foil [[DATABASE/monsterability/Lifesense|lifesense]], and you're [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] to any creature using only precise lifesense to observe you.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
