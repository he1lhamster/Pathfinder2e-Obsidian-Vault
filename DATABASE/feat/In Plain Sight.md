People often only see what they want to see, a weakness you know how to take full advantage of. While you've Assumed a Role, you can use [[Deception]] in place of [[Stealth]] when using the [[Avoid Notice]] exploration activity in an area where someone with your role wouldn't be unusual, such as when impersonating a sailor or fisher when infiltrating the docks.
