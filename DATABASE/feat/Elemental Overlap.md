Though you've dedicated yourself to one element, you learn to mix that element with another. Gain a composite impulse feat that includes your kinetic element. You can use that impulse even though you can't channel all its elements. The feat's level must be lower than the level at which you selected Elemental Overlap.
**Special** You can select this feat more than once, choosing a different impulse feat each time.
