You were forced into service as a laborer, either pressed into indentured servitude or shackled by the evils of slavery, but you've since escaped and have trained to ensure you'll never be caught again. Whenever you roll a success on a check to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] or a saving throw against an effect that would impose the [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] condition on you, you get a critical success instead. Whenever a creature rolls a failure on a check to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] you, they get a critical failure instead. If a creature uses the [[DATABASE/monsterability/Grab|Grab]] ability on you, it must succeed at an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to grab you instead of automatically grabbing you.
