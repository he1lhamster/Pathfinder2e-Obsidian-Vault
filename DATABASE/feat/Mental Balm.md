---
Your spells release soothing mental waves. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. You can use this amp only on a psi cantrip that targets or affects you or one or more of your allies and doesn't target or affect any enemies.

---
**Amp** You or one ally within 30 feet gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves against emotion effects for 1 minute. You can also have the amped psi cantrip attempt to counteract one effect imposing the frightened condition on yourself or the chosen ally, or an effect imposing the stupefied condition that has a duration of 1 hour or less. If you successfully counteract the effect, you remove only the frightened and stupefied conditions, not any other part of the effect.

## Traits

**Amp:**

An amp is a special thoughtform that modifies the properties of your psi cantrips. Psi cantrips each have their own amp, and feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps.

**Emotion:**

This effect alters a creature's emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.
