You've learned obscure lessons about your fellow fetchlings. You're trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Shadow Plane Lore]].
