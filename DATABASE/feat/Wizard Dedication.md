**Prerequisites** Intelligence 14

---
You cast spells like a wizard, gaining a [[DATABASE/equipment/Spellbook (Blank)|spellbook]] with four common arcane cantrips of your choice. You gain the Cast a Spell activity. You can prepare two cantrips each day from your spellbook. You're trained in arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for wizard archetype spells is Int, and they are arcane wizard spells. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]]; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. Select one arcane school of magic; you don't gain any abilities from your choice of school.
**Special** You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the wizard archetype.
