---
You've mastered a defensive technique unique to the ancient dragons of Bloodsalt: beating your wings to create a billowing cloud of mist. You become momentarily [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from the triggering attack if vision is the attacker's only precise sense. Normally this means the attacker must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to target you. You also gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
