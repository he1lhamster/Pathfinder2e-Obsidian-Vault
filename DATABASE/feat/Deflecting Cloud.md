You've mastered a defensive technique unique to the ancient dragons of Bloodsalt: beating your wings to create a billowing cloud of mist. You become momentarily [[Hidden]] from the triggering attack if vision is the attacker's only precise sense. Normally this means the attacker must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to target you. You also gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.
