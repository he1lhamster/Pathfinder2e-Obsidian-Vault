When you Make an Impression, you can compare your Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It’s possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets increases to four if you’re an expert, 10 if you’re a master, and 25 if you’re legendary.

## Traits

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
