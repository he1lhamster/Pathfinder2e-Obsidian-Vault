Your lineage shows the signs of [[Velstrac]] tampering, including some curious quirk bequeathed by those shadowy surgeons of flesh and souls. Your flesh heals cleanly and quickly—all the better for you to serve as a subject for their ghastly art. You gain the [[Fast Recovery]] feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites.

## Traits

**Lineage:**

A feat with this trait indicates a character's descendance from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat. You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of these feats.

**Tiefling:**

A creature with this trait has the tiefling versatile heritage. Tieflings are [[Planar Scion]] descended from fiends. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tieflings.
