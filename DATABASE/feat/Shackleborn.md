Your lineage shows the signs of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Velstrac|velstrac]] tampering, including some curious quirk bequeathed by those shadowy surgeons of flesh and souls. Your flesh heals cleanly and quickly—all the better for you to serve as a subject for their ghastly art. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Fast Recovery|Fast Recovery]] feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites.
