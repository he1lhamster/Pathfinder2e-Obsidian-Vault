You become more adept with the spells that are always in your mind. You gain an additional spell slot of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th levels. You can use these spell slots to cast only a spell granted by your conscious mind. At 18th level, you also gain an additional 5th-level spell slot, with the same restrictions.
