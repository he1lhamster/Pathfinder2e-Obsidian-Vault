You draw upon the reservoir of your patron's magic that resides within your familiar. During your turn, you can cast one spell your familiar knows that was granted by your patron's theme or lessons without spending a spell slot to do so (or even having it prepared). The spell must be at least 1 level lower than your highest-level witch spell slot.
**Special** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).
