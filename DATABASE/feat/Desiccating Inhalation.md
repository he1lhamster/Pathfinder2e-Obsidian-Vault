You draw in the moisture from nearby creatures, draining them dry to heal your wounds. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take 6d8 negative damage, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails this saving throw is also [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]]. As long as at least one creature was damaged by your Desiccating Inhalation, you regain HP equal to your level.
 At 14th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d8.
