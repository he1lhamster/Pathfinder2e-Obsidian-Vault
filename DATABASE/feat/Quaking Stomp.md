**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
