You make an assessment informed by your knowledge of how a creature fights. Attempt a check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about a creature. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check if you previously hit the creature with a Strike this turn. If your check is successful, recharge your Spellstrike. The subject of your check is temporarily immune to Magus's Analysis for 1 day.
