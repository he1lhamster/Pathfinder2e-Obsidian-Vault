When you resist a spell, you capture some of its magic for your own use. You enter your Arcane Cascade stance, using the triggering spell to determine what damage type your Arcane Cascade deals. Alternatively, if you're already in Arcane Cascade, you can instead amplify its effects temporarily. Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +2 status bonus to the damage from your Arcane Cascade.
