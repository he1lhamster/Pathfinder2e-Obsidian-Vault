Your steps echo with the thunderous retort of exploding black powder as you dance a dance of death. Take any of the following actions you choose in any order: Step, Strike against a target within your firearm's first range increment, and Interact to reload. If you attempted a Strike and it succeeded, you can repeat these three actions again in any order. If you attempted a Strike in the second set and succeeded, you can repeat the actions one last time.
 After using Dance of Thunder, you become fatigued for 1 minute.
