Your spell leaves a lingering connection between you and a creature—one through which you can nudge the creature's mind this way or that. The amped cantrip must take 2 or more actions to cast, target one or more creatures, and either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw. Use this amp in place of the psi cantrip's normal amp entry.

---
**Amp** Choose one enemy who is a target of the spell. If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you whisper in the creature's mind, forcing it to Step in a direction of your choosing; as this is forced movement, you can't force the creature to Step into hazardous terrain, off a ledge, or the like. After it Steps, the creature becomes temporarily immune to this amp for 24 hours.

## Traits

**Amp:**

An amp is a special thoughtform that modifies the properties of your psi cantrips. Psi cantrips each have their own amp, and feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps.

**Enchantment:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the enchantment school of magic, typically involving mind control, emotion alteration, and other mental effects.

**Mental:**

A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

**Occult:**

This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.
