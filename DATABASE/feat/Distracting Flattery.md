You know how to maintain a good impression and manage your image, even while keeping uncouth company. Make a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check against the target's Will DC. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Distracting Flattery for 10 minutes.
**Success** The target's attitude doesn't decrease as a result of your ally's social blunder.
**Failure** The target's attitude decreases, as normal.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt makes matters worse, decreasing the target's attitude toward you by one step, in addition to any changes from the behavior that triggered this reaction.
