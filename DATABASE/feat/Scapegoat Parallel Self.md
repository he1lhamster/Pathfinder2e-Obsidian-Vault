Seeing Syndara superimpose creatures with similar metaphysical properties, you've realized a way to manipulate the effects of your oracular curse. You immediately change your curse to its minor, moderate, or major stage, or back to its mild form, exchanging the curse effect with that of a parallel version of yourself in another reality.
