You have a knack for breaking and dismantling things. Putting them back together is the boring part, so you largely don't bother with that. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]]. If you would automatically become trained in Thievery (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. In addition, whenever you hit with a Strike against a trap or an unattended object, you ignore the first 5 points of the object's Hardness.
