Your confidence borders on self-delusion, but it keeps you going against overwhelming odds. Attempt a Deception check against the attack DC of the triggering Strike. You take a penalty to this check equal to twice your wounded value, if any. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, use the result one degree of success worse than what you rolled.
**Critical Success** You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point.
**Success** You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, but you increase your [[Wounded]] value by 1.
