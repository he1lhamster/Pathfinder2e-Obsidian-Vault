Your twirling weapons create a grand distraction that's difficult to look away from. When using Pistol Twirl to [[DATABASE/action/Feint|Feint]], you can target all enemies within your weapon's first range increment who you can perceive and who can see you. You roll one [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check and compare it against each target's Perception DC.
