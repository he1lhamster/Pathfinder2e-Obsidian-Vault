You are dedicated to the cause of the Shining Sentinels. You gain expert proficiency in [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]]. When you are between an ally and a foe and would provide lesser cover to your ally against the foe’s attacks, you twist to become even more obtrusive, providing standard cover instead.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Knight Vigilant archetype.
