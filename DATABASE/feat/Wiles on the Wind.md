Speaking lies, you set them loose upon a drifting wind. You create an auditory illusion that comes from a square within 500 feet and can be as loud as four normal humans talking. The sound can be intricate, including speech or music, though the GM might require you to attempt a check or know a language for it to be convincing. The illusion lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse.
 You can have any creature within 40 feet of the illusion, or that comes within 40 feet of it during the duration, attempt a Will save against your class DC. This is a mental effect.
**Success** The creature is unaffected, disbelieves the illusion, and is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
**Failure** The creature is [[Fascinated]] with the source of the sound until the end of its next turn. When the fascination ends, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is fascinated for 1 minute or until it [[War Pony]].

## Traits

**Air:**

Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air with various degrees of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies.

**Auditory:**

Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as [[Deafened]] targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.

**Illusion:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the illusion school of magic, typically involving false sensory stimuli.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
