**Trigger** You're about to roll initiative.

---
You allow your foes to make the first move in a show of incredible confidence. You don't roll initiative; instead you voluntarily go last. You gain panache. If more than one character uses this ability or another ability to go last, use the normal rules for resolving a tie: NPCs and monsters act before PCs, and within those groups, the creatures can choose whichever order they want.
