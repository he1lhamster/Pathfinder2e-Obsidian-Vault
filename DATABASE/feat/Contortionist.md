You can squeeze out of tight situations surprisingly quickly, gaining an advantage against foes that try to pin you down. You gain the [[Quick Squeeze]] skill feat, and if you're a master in [[Acrobatics]], you can Squeeze at full Speed. Whenever you successfully [[Escape]] using Acrobatics, the creature you Escaped from is [[Flat-Footed]] against the next attack you make against it before the end of your next turn.
