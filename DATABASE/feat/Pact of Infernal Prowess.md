You've sworn a pact with [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|devils]], granting you success in life in exchange for your soul in the afterlife. Once per hour, when you critically fail a check, you can reroll the check as a free action; this is a fortune effect. Additionally, you can choose to automatically succeed at checks to [[DATABASE/action/Earn Income|Earn Income]] for tasks below your level, without rolling.
 However, when you die, your soul is consigned to [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell]]. You can't be returned to life except by powerful magic such as [[DATABASE/spell/Miracle|miracle]], and even then, the devils responsible for the contract can track your every move for 1 year. The devils gain the effects of a [[DATABASE/spell/Discern Location|discern location]] spell. They can also use 10th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Scrying|scrying]] on you at will, and you automatically critically fail your saving throw.
**Special** You can't retrain out of a Pact of Infernal Prowess without journeying to Hell and destroying the devil's written contract spelling out the terms of your pact.
