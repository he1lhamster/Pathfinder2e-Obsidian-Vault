---
The chill of ice entered your veins and never left, adjusting the internal temperature of your body. Your breath comes out in puffs, and your skin is as cold and smooth as the ice in your veins. You can cast [[Ray of Frost]] as a primal innate cantrip. You gain resistance to cold damage equal to half your level, and you're protected from severe cold temperatures.

## Traits

**Aftermath:**

This trait describes feats that represent special abilities gained after exposure to the weird and deadly.

**Cold:**

Effects with this trait deal cold damage. Creatures with this trait have a connection to magical cold.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
