Sheets of bent and rusted metal cover you in an armored shell. The carapace is medium armor but uses your highest armor proficiency. The carapace's statistics are: _AC Bonus_ +3; _Dex Cap_ +2; _Check Penalty_ –2; _Speed Penalty_ –5 feet; _Strength_ 14; _Bulk_ 2; _Group_ [[DATABASE/armorgroup/Plate|plate]]; _Armor Traits_ noisy. Any bonuses, runes, and magical abilities of your actual armor are suppressed, but any that could apply to the metal carapace are replicated onto it.
 When you use this impulse, you can also create a rusty steel shield in a free hand, which uses the statistics of a regular steel shield. You can [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] with this shield even if you don't have that feat. The hand wielding this shield counts as a free hand for using impulses. The shield crumbles to flakes of rust if it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]] or leaves your grasp.
 The impulse lasts for 10 minutes, and you can Dismiss this impulse. If you use this impulse again, any existing one ends. The metal is rusted and fragile. If you take damage from a critical hit, the metal shatters and the impulse ends.

**Level (+3)** The shield's Hardness increases by 1, its HP by 4, and its BT by 2.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Metal:**

Effects with the metal trait conjure or manipulate metal. Those that manipulate metal have no effect in an area without metal. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of metal or have a connection to magical metal.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
