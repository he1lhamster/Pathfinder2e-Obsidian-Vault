<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** member of the Pathfinder Society
**Access** You are from Absalom.

---
Your Pathfinder training has broadened your horizons and made you more flexible at various skills, since you never know when you might need an obscure skill to complete your mission. You become trained in one skill of your choice, or expert in a skill of your choice in which you were trained. You also become trained in Pathfinder [[Lore]], or an expert if you were already trained. When using a skill untrained, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level instead of 0. You gain access to [[Wayfinder]].
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Pathfinder Agent archetype.
