Your taunts and threats earn your foes ire. When you successfully [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a creature, its [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] condition can't decrease to less than 1 at the end of its turn until it either uses a hostile action against you or can no longer observe or sense you for at least 1 round.
