Thick tattoos, each one a rune fragment from the saumen kar's long-lost language spelling out their pact with their equally lost deity, cover your body and stretch across your limbs, torso, and face. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against evil and necromancy spells and effects. You can sense the presence of evil undead as a pervasive taste of oily corruption in the air; this is a vague sense that allows you to know when such a creature is within 60 feet of you, though you can't precisely pinpoint their location with this sense. As normal for a vague sense, it can be fooled, but undead might not realize they need to take precautions against it. This sense also extends to living creatures who have the [[DATABASE/monsterability/Negative Healing|negative healing]] ability, like [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dhampir|dhampir]].
 You deal an additional 1 cold damage with all Strikes made with an ice-crafted weapon. If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Crown of the Saumen Kar|Crown of the Saumen Kar]] feat, you deal an additional 1 cold damage with your unarmed horns Strikes.
