You can guide your crop to move without notice. When you and any of your crop are Avoiding Notice, you can choose one member of your crop to temporarily gain the benefits of the [[DATABASE/feat/Quiet Allies|Quiet Allies]] skill feat until the group is no longer Avoiding Notice. The group rolls two checks instead of one, using the higher die roll. This is a fortune effect.

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
