Your interactions with other cultures on the surface have not only taught you about many other ancestries, but have also helped you realize the value of your own. You gain the trained proficiency rank in the [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] skill (or another skill of your choice if you were already trained in Society), and you gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] skill feat for the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] corresponding to your culture (for instance, Ouat Lore or Pahmet Lore).

## Traits

**Dwarf:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the dwarf ancestry. Dwarves are stout folk who often live underground and typically have [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by dwarves. An item with this trait is created and used by dwarves.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
