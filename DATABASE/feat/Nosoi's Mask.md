---
Many [[Psychopomp]] wear masks when dealing with the living, and many cultures believe that seeing an unmasked psychopomp's face invites death. You are trained in [[Intimidation]] and gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat. If you were already trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also know how to make masks like those worn by psychopomps, a process that takes 1 hour and 1 sp of appropriate material. If you instead pay 50 gp for a splendid psychopomp mask, the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to Intimidation while you are wearing it. Its usage is worn (mask).
