You control the size of your kinetic aura. You can make your kinetic aura's emanation any size from a 5-foot emanation to a 20-foot emanation (you must choose a multiple of 5). You choose the size when you [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]] and can change it when you use a stance impulse that affects your kinetic aura. Increase the maximum size you can choose by 5 feet at 15th and 20th levels.
