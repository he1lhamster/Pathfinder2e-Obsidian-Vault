When you Unleash your Psyche, all your rage and pain—the portion of your psyche dedicated to cruel retribution—come along with it.
 The force of your dark persona's negativity batters constantly against all creatures in a 30-foot emanation when you Unleash your Psyche and for as long as your Psyche is Unleashed. A creature must attempt a Will save against your spell DC the first time it enters the emanation, or if it's in the emanation when you take this action; it doesn't need to attempt a save again, even if it leaves the emanation and returns. A creature [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] by your Dark Persona's Presence can't decrease its frightened value below 1 while within the emanation.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The target is frightened 1.
**Failure** The target is frightened 2.
**Critical Failure** The target is frightened 3.
 While your Psyche is Unleashed, your dark persona cares only for destruction. You can Cast a Spell only if it can directly damage an enemy or object or can impose a detrimental condition or penalty on one.
