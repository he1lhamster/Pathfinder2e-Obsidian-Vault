**Trigger** You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical item that has the elixir trait and is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.

---
You’ve discovered how to mix two elixirs into a single hybrid concoction. You can spend 2 additional batches of infused reagents to add a second elixir to the one you’re crafting. The second elixir must also be at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level, and the combination elixir is an alchemical item two levels higher than the higher of the two elixirs’ levels. When this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs take effect. For example, you can combine two [[Elixir of Life]] to create a combined elixir that heals twice the normal amount, or you can combine a [[Darkvision Elixir]] with a [[Eagle-Eye Elixir]] to both gain darkvision and find secret doors.

## Traits

**Additive 2:**

Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the [[Quick Alchemy]] action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level.
