# Additional Circus Trick <span class="item-type">Feat 3</span>

<span class="item-trait">Circus</span><span class="item-trait">General</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Come One, Come All, to the Extinction Curse Player’s Guide!|Come One, Come All, to the Extinction Curse Player’s Guide!]]
**Prerequisites** You must have a signature trick

---
Your signature trick can have one additional trait beyond the number provided in Table 2: Trick Progression on page 63 of _Pathfinder #151: The Show Must Go On_. If the trick trait has an associated skill (such as [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] with the fire trait) and that skill is one of your trick checks, your checks with that skill to Perform a Trick aren't penalized if you Perform a Trick using a different skill. For example, if your signature trick has [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] and Intimidation as trick checks and you take this feat to add the fire trait, you can Perform a Trick using Acrobatics (at no penalty), then Acrobatics again (at a -5 penalty), and then Intimidation (at no penalty).
