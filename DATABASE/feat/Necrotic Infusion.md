You pour negative energy into your undead subject to empower its attacks. If the next action you use is to cast [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] to restore Hit Points to a single undead creature, the target then deals an additional 1d6 negative damage with its melee weapons and unarmed attacks until the end of its next turn. If the _harm_ spell is at least 5th level, this damage increases to 2d6, and if the _harm_ spell is at least 8th level, the damage increases to 3d6.

## Traits

**Concentrate:**

An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.

**Metamagic:**

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
