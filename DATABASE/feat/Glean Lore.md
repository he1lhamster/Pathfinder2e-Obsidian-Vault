You tap into the collected lore of the divine, accessing a variety of potentially useful information. Attempt a [[Religion]] check to understand the information you gain. The GM sets the DC (similar to the DC to [[Recall Knowledge]]), potentially adjusting the DC of the check for topics far removed from your mystery.
**Critical Success** You comprehend the lore accurately or gain a useful clue from the divine about your situation.
**Success** You learn two pieces of information about the topic, one true and one erroneous, but you don't know which is which.
**Failure** You recall incorrect information or gain an erroneous or misleading clue.
**Critical Failure** You recall two pieces of incorrect information or gain two erroneous or misleading clues.
