Your eidolon inflicts bleeding wounds on a telling blow. If your eidolon critically hits with a melee unarmed Strike that deals slashing or piercing damage, its target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]]. Your eidolon gains an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the unarmed attack's item bonus to attack rolls. This is a critical specialization effect.
