**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Trigger** Your turn begins, and you are at half or fewer Hit Points.

---
Your blood boils when you take a beating, and you throw caution to the wind to finish the fight. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls, a –2 penalty to AC, and a –1 penalty to saves. These bonuses and penalties last until your Rage ends or until you are above half Hit Points, whichever comes first.

## Traits

**Rage:**

You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.
