**Archetype** [[Snarecrafter]]

---
You've learned to create a limited number of snares at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare four snares from your [[Formula Book (Blank)]] for quick deployment; if they normally take 1 minute to [[Craft]], you can Craft them with 3 Interact actions. The number of snares increases to six if you're a master in Crafting and eight if you're legendary. Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft.
**Special** The feat counts as [[Snare Specialist]] for the purpose of feat prerequisites. If you also have the Snare Specialist ranger feat, the quick snares from both feats are cumulative. You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter archetype.
