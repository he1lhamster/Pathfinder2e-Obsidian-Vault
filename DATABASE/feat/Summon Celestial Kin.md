You have a connection to the celestial realms, allowing you to summon a celestial ally. Once per day, you can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Summon Celestial|summon celestial]] as a 5th-level divine innate spell, but the celestial summoned must be from the same category as your own lineage, such as a creature with the angel trait if you are angelkin.
