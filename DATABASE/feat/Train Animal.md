---
You spend time teaching an animal to do a certain action. You can either select a basic action the animal already knows how to do (typically those listed in the [[Command an Animal]] action) or attempt to teach the animal a new basic action. The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time the training takes (usually at least a week). It’s usually impossible to teach an animal a trick that uses critical thinking. If you’re expert, master, or legendary in [[Nature]], you might be able to train more unusual creatures, at the GM’s discretion.
**Success** The animal learns the action. If it was an action the animal already knew, you can Command the Animal to take that action without attempting a Nature check. If it was a new basic action, add that action to the actions the animal can take when Commanded, but you must still roll.
**Failure** The animal doesn’t learn the trick.

## Traits

**Downtime:**

An activity with this trait takes a day or more, and can be used only during downtime.

**General:**

A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

**Manipulate:**

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

**Skill:**

A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.
