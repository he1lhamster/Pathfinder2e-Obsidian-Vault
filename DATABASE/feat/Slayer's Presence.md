Your very presence strikes fear into the undead. When you use [[DATABASE/feat/Undead Slayer Dedication|Slayer's Identification]] and succeed at your check, you can Frighten Undead as a free action, targeting the creature you identified. Any time you get a critical success to Frighten Undead, if the target's level is lower than yours, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] for 1 round.
