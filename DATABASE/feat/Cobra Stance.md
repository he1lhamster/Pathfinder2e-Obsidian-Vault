You enter a tight stance, coiled up like a lashing cobra with your hands poised as venomous fangs. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are cobra fang unarmed attacks. These deal 1d4 poison damage; are in the [[Brawling]] group; and have the agile, deadly d10, finesse, nonlethal, poison, and unarmed traits.
 While in Cobra Stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves and your Fortitude DC, and you gain poison resistance equal to half your level.

## Traits

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
