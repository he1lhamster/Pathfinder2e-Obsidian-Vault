Your panache allows you to perform incredible feats: climbing, swimming, and leaping far beyond your normal capacity. While you have panache, you gain the following benefits.

* You gain climb and swim Speeds equal to half your land Speed.
* The DCs of your [[High Jump]] and [[Long Jump]] decrease by 10. This doesn't combine with other abilities that reduce those DCs.
* The distance you can move with a vertical [[Leap]] increases to 5 feet. Your distance for a horizontal Leap increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.
