Not even space itself is a match for the unleashed power of your mind. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Teleport|teleport]] as an innate occult spell. You don't need to touch creatures to target them with this innate spell as long as they're in range of your empathic sense.

## Traits

**Kashrishi:**

A stout ancestry bearing distinctive crystal horns and inherent psychic abilities.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
