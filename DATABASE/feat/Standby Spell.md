You've honed one spell as your favored combat technique, and you've practiced it enough that you no longer need to prepare it to cast it. Choose a spell in your [[Spellbook (Blank)]] that you could use with Spellstrike and that has a level no higher than the highest-level magus spell slot you have. You can Cast this Spell without having it prepared ahead of time by expending a spell slot of a sufficient level to cast your chosen spell. You can change this spell whenever you add new spells to your spellbook, or by studying your spellbook for 1 hour.
