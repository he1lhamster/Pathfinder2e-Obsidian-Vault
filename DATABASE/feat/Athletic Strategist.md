You know how to calculatedly manipulate joints and body weight. In addition to using [[DATABASE/action/Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Stratagem]] to modify a Strike, you can use it to modify a [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]], [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]], [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]], or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] attempt, substituting your Devise a Stratagem roll for the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check. You must apply the substitution to the first eligible attack you make, whether it's a Strike or one of the Athletics actions.
 You can also use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength for the Athletics check when you substitute your Devise a Stratagem roll, unless you're using a weapon for the maneuver and the weapon doesn't fit the restrictions for using Intelligence with a stratagem.
