PFS Note

---
Your identity as a member of your clan is as central to your sense of self as your dwarven ancestry. You gain the trained proficiency rank in the two skills of your clan. If you would automatically become trained in one of these skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in the listed [[Lore]] for your clan. If you come from a clan not listed here, you become trained in an appropriate selection of skills as determined by your GM. Since the trade of a clan takes a while to learn, these skills don't automatically change should you ever leave your clan and join another, though your GM might allow you to change these skills as part of retraining during downtime.
