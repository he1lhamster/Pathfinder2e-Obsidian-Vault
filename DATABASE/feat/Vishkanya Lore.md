You deeply understand vishkanyan strengths and cultural traditions. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Vishkanya Lore]].
