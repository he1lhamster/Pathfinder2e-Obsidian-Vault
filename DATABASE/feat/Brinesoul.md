---
Your elemental ancestor's legacy asserts itself as brackish water, like the seawater of the ocean. You gain the Salt Wound reaction.
**Salt Wound** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (undine) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** A creature that has blood and is not at its maximum Hit Points hits you with a melee Strike; **Effect** You channel salt and brine from your blood into the creature's wounds. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent acid damage]] and is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] by the pain. On a critical failure, it instead takes 2d6 persistent acid damage and is sickened 2.
