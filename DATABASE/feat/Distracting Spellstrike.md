You weave distracting magic with one hand to enhance your Spellstrike. Make a Spellstrike and [[Feint]] against the target of your Strike. Do this immediately before making the Strike, but after choosing your target. The Feint gains the arcane, illusion, and visual traits, and it always has the basic effects of a Feint, rather than applying any adjustments or alternate effects from other feats or abilities.
