**Trigger** You're about to attempt a Fortitude save or a Reflex save.

---
Flames scouring at your body, venom coursing through your veins—you refuse to believe they exist, and nothing can affect you if you don't believe in it. You attempt a Will save against the triggering effect, instead of a Reflex or Fortitude save. You don't gain the benefits of fortress of will or walls of will on this save.

## Traits

**Psyche:**

Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.
