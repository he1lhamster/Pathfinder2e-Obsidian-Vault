In addition, when you cast a spell that requires one or more actions while in this stance, your unarmed Strikes gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage.

## Traits

**Archetype:**

This feat belongs to an archetype.

**Stance:**

A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
