You drive your piercing weapon into an imperceptible foe, revealing its location to your allies. Make a Strike with the required melee weapon. You don't have to attempt a flat check to hit a [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] creature, and you have to succeed at only a DC 5 flat check to target a [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] creature. If you hit and deal damage, you can drive the required weapon into a corporeal target, revealing its current position. You Release the weapon, and it becomes lodged in the target. If the target is concealed, other creatures don't need to succeed at a flat check to hit it. If the target is hidden, other creatures have to succeed at only a DC 5 flat check to target it. The creatures need to be able to see your weapon to gain any of these benefits, and the target can't become [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] to anyone who sees your weapon. If the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]], the weapon remains visible while lodged in it.
 This benefit lasts until the weapon is removed from the creature. An adjacent creature or the target can remove the weapon with 2 Interact actions.
