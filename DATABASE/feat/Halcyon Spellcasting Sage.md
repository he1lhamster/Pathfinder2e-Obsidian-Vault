Your command over halcyon magic is nearly unmatched. You gain two common 6th-level and 7th-level halcyon spells. You also gain a 6th-level halcyon spell slot and a 7th-level halcyon spell slot. Your proficiency rank in either arcane or primal spell DCs and spell attack rolls advances from expert to master.
