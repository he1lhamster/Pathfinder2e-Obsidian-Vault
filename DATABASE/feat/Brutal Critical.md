Your critical hits are particularly devastating. On a critical hit with a melee Strike, add one extra damage die. This is in addition to any extra dice you gain if the weapon is deadly or fatal. The target also takes [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] equal to two damage dice.
