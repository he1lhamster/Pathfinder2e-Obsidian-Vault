You learn a mystical stance that transforms your ki into sticky smoke that shrouds your limbs, clinging to everything you touch. You gain the [[Clinging Shadows Stance]] ki spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. While entering the stance uses a ki spell, the shadow grasp attacks it grants are not, so you can use them as often as you like while in the stance.
