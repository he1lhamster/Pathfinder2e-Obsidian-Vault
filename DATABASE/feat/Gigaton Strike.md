When you use a full-power Megaton Strike, you can knock your foe back. When you succeed at your Strike while using an unstable Megaton Strike, your target must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is pushed back 5 feet.
**Failure** The creature is pushed back 10 feet.
**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed back 20 feet.
**Special** If your innovation is a minion, this benefit applies on its unstable Megaton Strikes.
