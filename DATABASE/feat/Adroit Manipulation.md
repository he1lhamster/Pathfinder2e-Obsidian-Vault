You’ve fiddled with knots, locks, and blacksmith’s puzzles since you were a child to give your hands something to do. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Thievery]] (or another skill of your choice, if you’re already trained in Thievery). If you roll a success on a Thievery check to Pick a Lock, you get a critical success instead.

## Traits

**Halfling:**

A creature with this trait is a member of the [[Halfling]] ancestry. These small people are friendly wanderers considered to be lucky. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by halflings. A weapon with this trait is created and used by halflings.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
