<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">All Ancestries</span>
**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Prerequisites** [[Fey Influence]]

---
You become a powerful fey creature, gaining strengths tied to the [[First World]] but also some of the weakness against which all fey must contend. You gain a +2 status bonus to saves against illusion, emotion, and enchantment effects, and you can use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make an Impression]] on and to make very simple [[Request]] of animals and plants. You regain twice the number of Hit Points when resting in a natural wooded area, such as a forest or jungle. You have weakness to [[Cold Iron Weapon]] equal to half your level.
**Special** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for [[Human]], goblin for [[Goblin]], etc.).

## Traits

**All Ancestries:**

A feat with this trait is available to all ancestries.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
