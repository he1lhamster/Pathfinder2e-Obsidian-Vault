# Defy the Darkness <span class="item-type">Feat 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Dwarf</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Prerequisites** darkvision

---
Using ancient dwarven methods developed to fight enemies wielding magical darkness, you've honed your darkvision and sworn not to use such magic yourself. You gain [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|greater darkvision]], enabling you to see through magical darkness even if it normally hampers darkvision (such as the darkness created by a 4th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Darkness|darkness]] spell). You can't cast spells with the darkness trait, use item activations with the darkness trait, or use any other ability with the darkness trait.
