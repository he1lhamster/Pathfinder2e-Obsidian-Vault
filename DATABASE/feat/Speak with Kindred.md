You have a connection with creatures that share your physiology. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill with plants or fungi that match your leshy heritage. Generally, fungus leshies can speak to mushrooms and fungi; gourd leshies can speak to gourds, melons, and similar fruiting plants; leaf leshies can speak with deciduous trees; and vine leshies can speak with vines and climbing plants. The GM determines which plants or fungi count for this ability.
