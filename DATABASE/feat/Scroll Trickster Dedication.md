You've studied scrolls in depth. This might have been a comprehensive education in formal setting, or the sort of education where you somehow obtain a number of scrolls and try not to explode anything you didn't mean to explode. You gain the [[Trick Magic Item]] feat, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick scrolls. If you roll a critical failure to Trick a Magic Item that's a scroll, you get a failure instead.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scroll trickster archetype.
