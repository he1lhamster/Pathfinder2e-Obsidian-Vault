Striking out against your enemies draws praise and protection from your deity. When you damage a creature with a Strike using your deity’s favored weapon, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level, or equal to your level if the Strike was a critical hit. These temporary Hit Points last until the start of your next turn.
