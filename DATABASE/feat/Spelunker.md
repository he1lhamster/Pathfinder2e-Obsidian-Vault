Living underground, you have learned to find your way without landmarks or even solid ground. If you roll a success on an [[Survival]] check to [[Sense Direction]] or an [[Athletics]] check to [[Climb]], you get a critical success instead. You're not [[Flat-Footed]] when you attempt to Climb.

## Traits

Secretive humanoids covered in bony plumage that reside underground.
