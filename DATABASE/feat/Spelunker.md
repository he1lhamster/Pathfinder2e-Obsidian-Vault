Living underground, you have learned to find your way without landmarks or even solid ground. If you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]] or an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], you get a critical success instead. You're not [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] when you attempt to Climb.
