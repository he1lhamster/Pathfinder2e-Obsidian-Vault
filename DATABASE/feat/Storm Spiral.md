Dark thunderclouds swirl in a miniature storm, crisscrossed with lightning bolts; a tremendous thunderclap fills the air. The storm appears in a 20-foot burst within 60 feet. Each creature in the area takes 3d12 electricity damage and 1d10 sonic damage, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] until the end of its next turn (or for 1 minute on a critical failure). A creature wearing metal armor or made of metal takes a –1 circumstance penalty to its save.

**Level (+3)** The electricity damage increases by 1d12.

## Traits

**Air:**

Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element. Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air with various degrees of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies.

**Electricity:**

Effects with this trait deal electricity damage. A creature with this trait has a magical connection to electricity.

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Overflow:**

Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[DATABASE/action/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Sonic:**

An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage. A creature with this trait has a magical connection to powerful sound.
