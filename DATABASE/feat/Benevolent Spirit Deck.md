---
You manifest a ghostly deck of harrow cards that seek to protect you or an ally. Select one willing target within 30 feet; the cards move through the air to surround that target, protecting them from harm and granting a +1 status bonus to AC and resistance 5 to a type of damage associated with your active harrow omen (see below). This resistance increases to 10 if you're at least 10th level and 15 if you're 15th level. This effect lasts as long as you sustain it, up to 1 minute, or until you no longer have an active harrow omen. Once the effect ends, you lose your active harrow omen.

* **Hammers**: cold damage
* **Keys**: fire damage
* **Shields**: poison damage
* **Books**: electricity damage
* **Stars**: mental damage
* **Crowns**: acid damage
