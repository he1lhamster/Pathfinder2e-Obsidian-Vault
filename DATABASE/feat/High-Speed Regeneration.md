**Trigger** Your turn begins.

---
Your wounds knit together with barely a thought. You regain Hit Points equal to double your level. When you gain this deviation, the GM secretly selects one type of energy damage or precious material, such as fire or [[DATABASE/equipment/Cold Iron Weapon|cold iron]]. When you take damage of that type, your wound smokes until the end of your next turn, preventing you from using High-Speed Regeneration.
**Awakening** Your regeneration can automatically save you from the brink of death. Once per day, you can use High-Speed Regeneration when your Hit Points would be reduced to 0 instead of the usual trigger. You avoid being [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|knocked out]] and remain at the number of HP you regained.
**Awakening** Regrowth invigorates you. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed until the end of your turn.

## Traits

**Deviant:**

This trait describes strange supernatural or paranormal abilities.

**Healing:**

A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.

**Magical:**

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
 Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

**Necromancy:**

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death.

**Rare:**

This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.
