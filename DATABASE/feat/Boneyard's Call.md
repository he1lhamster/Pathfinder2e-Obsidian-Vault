You have a powerful connection to the [[Boneyard]] and its courts, granting you the ability to travel to and from the Boneyard. You gain [[Plane Shift]] as a divine innate spell. You can cast it twice per week. This can be used only to travel to the Boneyard or from the Boneyard to the [[Material Plane]]. Due to your unique connection to the Boneyard, your body serves as the focus, and you don't require a tuning fork.
