Your conviction redirects the undead’s attack through your armor and then harmlessly away. You gain resistance 5 to physical damage and resistance 10 to negative damage against the triggering attack. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against effects from the undead’s natural attack; if you succeed at the saving throw, you get a critical success instead.
