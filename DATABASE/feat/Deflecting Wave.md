**Trigger** You would take acid, bludgeoning, fire, or slashing damage from an enemy's attack, spell, or other hostile effect.
**Requirements** You're aware of the hostile effect, and you aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Off-Guard|off-guard]] against it.

---
A cascade of water blunts or disperses the incoming attack. You gain resistance to damage from the triggering effect equal to your level if it's bludgeoning or slashing, or double your level if it's acid or fire damage. If the effect deals more than one applicable type of damage, apply the highest resistance, but apply it only once.

## Traits

**Impulse:**

The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.

**Primal:**

This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

**Water:**

Effects with the water trait either manipulate or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a magical connection to the element. Planes with this trait are mostly liquid, perhaps with pockets of breathable air.
