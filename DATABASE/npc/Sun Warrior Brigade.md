The damage depends on the number of actions. 
 <span class="action-icon">1</span> 1d12+1 piercing damage 
 <span class="action-icon">2</span> 2d12+11 piercing damage 
 <span class="action-icon">3</span> 3d12+11 piercing damage</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Troop Movement** Whenever the troop Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troop enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Troop Spellcasting** When the sun warrior brigade Casts a Spell, its constituent members combine their efforts into casting a more powerful version of the spell than any one member could achieve alone. When Casting a Spell that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and doesn't have a duration, increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Walkena's Radiance** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, evocation, fire, light) The brigade calls upon [[DATABASE/deity/Walkena|Walkena]] to burn and blind their foes. The sun warriors present their [[DATABASE/equipment/Religious Symbol|religious symbols]] and create a white-hot flash of light in a 45-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 10d8 fire damage (DC 29 basic Fortitude save). Creatures that fail their save become [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round. Creatures that critically fail become [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round instead. When the troop is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 20-foot cone.</span>
