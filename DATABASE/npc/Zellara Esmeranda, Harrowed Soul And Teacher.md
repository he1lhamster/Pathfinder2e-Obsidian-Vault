description: 'Zane is the scion of a noble family in the Nine Walls, the homeland
  of Matanji orcs in the Mwangi expanse. He has natural charm and good looks and fully
  expects to become an ambassador for his people when he''s older. He considers his
  education at the Magaambya to be a pleasant dalliance, and he spends most his time
  with the friends he''s made there. Zane is an intelligent young man with something
  of a lazy streak, simply putting in the necessary work to get by.<br/><br/> When
  Zane was a toddler, his parents gave him to local priests for a blessing in a local
  river. Playful water spirits took notice of the baby and stole him from the inattentive
  priests. Zane''s parents believed he''d been drowned and lost. A year and a day
  after Zane disappeared, he washed back up on the banks of the river and was reunited
  with his relieved but puzzled family. Since then, Zane has felt the stirring of
  fey magic within him, but his family insisted on putting the disappearance firmly
  in the past and moving on. Zane''s budding powers frightened his family, so he learned
  to keep them hidden, something he no longer has to do since his enrollment in the
  Magaambya.<br/><br/> Due to his charm, Zane is quick to make friends, but he''s
  found he has the most in common with Ekene. The two both know how it feels to be
  misunderstood and understand the heavy weight of the expectations placed upon them

# Zellara Esmeranda, Harrowed Soul And Teacher

The Esmeranda clan was a storied group of traveling merchants, fortune-tellers, and performers whose lineage could be traced as far back as ancient Thassilon (or so the family tales say). When the eldest daughter of the clan, Zellara, found love during a visit to the city of Korvosa and elected to settle down in that city, the rest of the clan considered her departure bittersweet. Losing Zellara was a blow for the clan, but they were not about to interfere with the desires of her heart. Zellara bid her family farewell and settled down with her husband, Aramir, in the city's cosmopolitan Midland district. The two found a home, had a son, and generally lived a happy life for a few years.
 When Zellara lost Aramir to sickness, the rest of her clan urged her to return to them, but she had grown to love Korvosa and its people. She chose to stay and make a living as a harrower for tourists and interested locals. She also took on several students during this time, teaching them the honored tradition of harrowing that was passed down among her clan. Unfortunately, Zellara's love of the harrow would ultimately lead to her death.
 During an outing in the city, pickpockets working for a small-time criminal named Gaedren Lamm stole Zellara's cherished harrow deck. Her son Eran took it upon himself to recover the deck, only to end up dying at the hands of Gaedren's thugs. With her son dead and the city guard unable to help, Zellara searched for Eran's killer, eventually tracking down Gaedren to his hideout only to be slain by him as well. Overcome with anguish and despair at the moment of her death, Zellara's spirit connected to her harrow deck, allowing her to live on as a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghost|ghost]] intent on stopping Gaedren and protecting the city of Korvosa.
 As a ghost, Zellara recruited a group of heroes to help her with her goal. From her harrow, Zellara could advise the heroes and frequently performed harrow readings to guide them during their adventures. With Zellara's help, these heroes not only brought Gaedren to justice, but eventually liberated all Korvosa from the tyranny of its new ruler, Queen Ileosa Arabasti. In the final days of this campaign to save Korvosa, Zellara's deck become empowered, transforming into a [[DATABASE/equipment/Deck of Many Things|harrow deck of many things]]. This new deck gave the heroes a greater advantage moving toward their final battle.
 Feeling she had accomplished her goal and could trust the heroes to save the city, Zellara's spirit moved on to the [[DATABASE/plane/Boneyard|Boneyard]]. Once there, she awaited her soul's judgment, but realized that her connection to the power of the harrow deck of many things afforded her more liberty than other souls. She eventually discovered she could step “out of line” from her judgment, free to return when saw fit. Zellara saw this development as an opportunity to visit her loved ones one last time before moving on.
 Zellara returned to Golarion and watched the lives of her clan, the saviors of Korvosa, and her former students. She spent several years observing them from afar, occasionally providing subtle guidance to help them with their goals or problems. Among these was her final student, [[DATABASE/npc/Raven Nicoletta, Thief Of Fate|Raven Nicoletta]]. Zellara checked in with Raven several times over the years, watching her grow into a brilliant harrower, surpassing Zellara's skill and even some of the greatest harrowers of the Esmeranda clan. In recent years, however, Zellara watched Raven become selfish, obsessed with power and legacy, and fall into the ways of evil. Zellara remained with Raven, hoping to return her to a better path, but found herself no longer able to influence her former student. Raven was lost to her. Zellara now believes that Raven is beyond saving and, while mourning this loss, hopes to find someone to put an end to the evil Raven seeks to enact on the world.

## Campaign Role

Zellara is a guiding figure for the heroes. She's aware of Raven's entire history and can bring the heroes up to speed on Raven's abilities and motivations. Although Zellara's grown more powerful as a ghost than she ever was in life, Raven is still beyond her ability to stop all on her own—she needs the PCs to step up to this task. Zellara sees the same potential in these heroes as she saw in the heroes of Korvosa over a decade ago. She hopes that these heroes will be the ones to put an end to Raven's evil machinations, and perhaps even save her from herself. Having gained wisdom in her afterlife, Zellara can provide any information or advice the heroes might need on their journey to recover [[DATABASE/equipment/The Deck of Destiny|the Deck of Destiny]].
