# Ambrost Mugland, Cutthroat Underworld Mogul

Ambrost Mugland is one of the most powerful underworld kingpins in Alkenstar—at least to hear him tell it. In truth, he's a mid-level crime lord with an ego far larger than his coffers. In spite of his petty and delusional personality (or perhaps because of it), he's nonetheless a very dangerous man to cross. Mugland believes he's worked hard to get to where he is today, and he's grown used to having everything he feels he deserves: money, power, and infamy. His most strongly held conviction of all though, is that he's totally immune from any negative consequences of his actions.
 Mugland comes from humble beginnings but always had a taste for the finer things in life. His parents owned a tavern on the outskirts of posh Graeson's Fingers, and from an early age the boy practiced taking advantage of patrons too distracted or deep in their cups to notice the server boy picking their pockets. His mischief extended to extracurricular activities when he fell in with some friends his parents deemed “undesirables”—cutpurses, cons, charlatans, and all the rest. He left home for good when he was just 12 years old to join one of Alkenstar's many nameless gangs of miscreant youths.
 Mugland swiftly built a reputation as one of the most ruthless go-getters in the city. He was a keen lookout and scout, known for his quick wits and feet; within a year, he was second in command. Shortly after that, the gang's leader was found dead in his room one night. Mugland assumed control and motivated his underlings with the promise of revenge. So spurred, Mugland and his goons set about enacting one of the grandest campaigns in Alkenstar's criminal underworld. They eliminated potential rivals, cut deals with corrupt shieldmarshals, cowed businesses into protection rackets, invested in unsavory businesses, and consolidated Mugland's control. At the apex of his power, he betrayed every last one of the minions who helped him ascend to the highest echelons of organized crime, leaving a river of blood in his wake.
 He can shed his public persona of the cunning businessman in an instant, revealing a cold-hearted killer devoid of mercy and regret.
 These days, Mugland is a silent partner in a number of successful inns and taverns in Alkenstar, brokering protection from one of his hired gangs in exchange for a cut of the take. He has repeatedly tried to bring Vivielle Ramslay and the Steaming Kingdom under his umbrella but has been rebuffed at every turn. Theft, extortion, and murder continue to be the tools of Mugland's trade—tools he wielded to dramatic effect against the protagonists of this Adventure Path shortly before launching on his latest criminal crusade.
 When Mugland witnessed Vashon Gattlebee's pyronite exhibition at Blythir College, he knew he had to get his hands on the deadly new invention. To say nothing of what it could do for him personally should he wield it against his rivals, pyronite also promised Mugland a fortune in blood money if he could find the right buyers. With the help of his highest-ranking accomplice among the shieldmarshals, a corrupt deputy named Anjelique Loveless, Mugland located not one, but two customers: a Nexian and a Gebbite who both claimed to seek pyronite to bolster their side of the interminable war between their nations.
 Mugland's persistence has paid off in the past, but it seems his luck may have finally run out. He's all but gone bankrupt funding his pyronite scheme, which has been stymied at every turn by the betrayed outlaws he'd all but disregarded. It's too late to turn back, so Mugland continues to double down on his plans to seize pyronite, heedless of the potentially dire consequences.

## Campaign Role

Ambrost Mugland, along with Deputy Anjelique Loveless, the crooked high-ranking shieldmarshal he's (so far) kept in his pocket, functions as a common nemesis to unite the characters during their early adventures. The _Outlaws of Alkenstar Player's Guide_ includes backgrounds that give the characters different reasons they might hold a grudge against this brutal business tycoon or Deputy Loveless, and the assumed personal impetus for much of this Adventure Path is to enact vengeance against this craven crook. Beyond these origin stories though, Mugland is also the chief instigator of the campaign's central events—it's by his hand that the secrets of pyronite are released to Alkenstar and, potentially, beyond. Unfortunately for Mugland, his grandiose pursuit ultimately cost him his entire fortune. After the characters stop the Gilded Gunners' assault on the Steaming Kingdom in Chapter 3 of this volume, Mugland has nowhere left to turn. He's forced to concede to the Gunners' demands, taking up residence with them until he can settle his debt.
 This precarious situation is what finally allows the party to corner Mugland and settle their score with their otherwise-untouchable archenemy. When the player characters meet the Gilded Gunners' leader, Sabora Sharkosa, in Chapter 4 of this adventure, they can either spend their hard-earned capital to strike a deal with her so she'll hand over Mugland peacefully, or they can fight their way through the Gilded Gunners to reach their target by force. Either way, Mugland—spiteful to the very end—doesn't go down without a fight.
