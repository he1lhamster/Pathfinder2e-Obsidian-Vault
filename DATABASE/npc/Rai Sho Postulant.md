<span class="in-box-ability">**Nightmare Guardian** Yetis gain a status bonus to saves against fear and against spells and abilities that affect dreams. A yeti that falls prey to a supernatural nightmare loses this ability and becomes permanently enraged, gaining a status bonus to attack and damage rolls and a –1 status penalty to AC.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vanish <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** The yeti is [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] while not in combat, and a creature would observe it. **Effect** The yeti Strides or [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climbs]] up to half its Speed to a location where it can [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]], then Hides. If its new Stealth check result meets or exceeds the triggering creature's Perception DC, the yeti remains hidden.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Frozen Flurry** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (cold) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The Rai Sho postulant makes two Strikes, which can be any combination of claw or icicle Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. If either Strike hits and deals damage, the target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] (or stunned 3 on a critical failure); this save has the incapacitation trait.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Grisly Arrival** <span class="action-icon">4</span> (emotion, fear, mental) **Trigger** The yeti hits a creature in the first round of combat and the yeti was [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from that creature at the start of combat. **Effect** Each enemy within 30 feet that witnesses the attack (including the target of the attack) must attempt a DC 37 Will save. On a failure, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 2]]; on a critical failure, it's frightened 4.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Nine Seals Spellcasting** The Rai Sho postulants have learned a technique that allows them to cast their ki spells more effectively by way of specialized hand postures. They replace the normal somatic and verbal components of their spells with nine seals components; these require that the caster have a hand free, but don't add any traits to the Cast a Spell action (preventing the Rai Sho postulants from triggering certain reactions, such as [[DATABASE/monsterability/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]], when they Cast a Spell).</span>
