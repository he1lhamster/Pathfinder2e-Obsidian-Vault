_With a twinkle in her eye and a laugh always at the ready, this middle-aged halfling typifies a happy-go-lucky attitude. Yet the deep lines in her face and the rough callouses on her hands and feet indicate a life of unceasing effort in the service of ending slavery._

## Campaign Use

As the head of the Bellflower Network in Kintargo, Nolly Peltry is deeply concerned about the Scarlet Triad. In the short time that the slavers have begun operating in Kintargo, she has tried to flush out their agents, to no avail. When the PCs encounter Nolly on Kite Hill, she is an immediate ally against the Scarlet Triad, particularly if the PCs are willing to help her in sending messages. She is willing and able to fight with the PCs and, at the GM's discretion, might accompany them in this and future adventures.
