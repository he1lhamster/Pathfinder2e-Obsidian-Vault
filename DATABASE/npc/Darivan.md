# Darivan

Darivan is not the classic image of a [[Lamashtu]] cultist. While deeply religious, his magical power stems not from his faith, but from a link to his ancestral past. The favor of a [[Dryad]] helped his grandfather escape from a brutal life and find a safe new homeland for his people, but Darivan never held patience for that. To Darivan, his sorcerous legacy and his sinister faith are two wholly separate elements, but his recent visions of the bloom of Lamashtu bringing a new swath of monsters to the Stolen Lands has compelled him strongly, showing him how his fey ancestry and his demonic faith can be made stronger.
 In combat, Darivan relies on his spells against ranged foes and his falchion and claw in melee. He activates Bloom Regeneration if an attack reduces him to 100 Hit Points or fewer, then shifts tactics to casting [[Air Walk]] and retreating upward to use spells against foes.
