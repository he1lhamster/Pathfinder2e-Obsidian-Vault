# Ashen Swale

Ashen Swale's past is shrouded in mystery. He was born among his Sutaki brethren, but violent voices no one else could hear drew him to the wilds of Lost Mammoth Valley. In these wilds, he discovered his spirit guide Idovik and the art of necromancy. He returned to Lyuba a changed man. With Idovik at his side, he established new customs and foul rituals that further cemented the white dragon Venexus's reign over his people.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Corpse Puppet** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate, enchantment, incapacitation, manipulate, necromancy, primal) Ashen Swale seizes control of the body of a creature within 30 feet that is dead or [[Unconscious]]. The target must attempt a Will save. Dead creatures automatically fail this save. On a success, the target is permanently immune to Corpse Puppet. On a failure, the target is controlled by Ashen Swale. It gains the minion trait and can act as though it were alive and conscious as long as it's controlled by Ashen Swale. Controlling each target requires Ashen Swale to take an action to Command a Minion. The only actions the target can take during this time are [[Interact]], [[Stride]], and [[Strike]]. Ashen Swale retains control of the target for 10 minutes. This control ends immediately if the target loses the unconscious condition or the target is dealt an additional 50 damage since Ashen Swale took control (which destroys the body completely). After he has lost control of a target, that target is permanently immune to Corpse Puppet. Ashen Swale can control up to two targets with Corpse Puppet at a time.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Hasten Eidolon** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate) Ashen Swale focuses on the link he shares with Idovik to quicken his eidolon's actions.

If Idovik was already manifested, Ashen Swale chooses whether to unmanifest Idovik or to teleport Idovik to an adjacent open space. If Idovik unmanifested at 0 Hit Points, this process takes 1 minute instead of 3 actions, but Idovik regains 1 Hit Point when he remanifests.</span>
