# Kalaggi Nakutu

Bundasu is one of countless villages that lie hidden in the depths of the Mwangi Jungle. As a child there, Kalaggi learned that the stars told a story with her in the role as Bundasu's next keeper, the village's physical and spiritual protector. Kalaggi was quick to learn combat and hunting. Tapping into her spiritual side, however, was much more difficult. Rather than push the young girl and risk her losing confidence, the villagers focused her training in the areas she was already competent.
 Once she mastered her martial skills, Kalaggi set her sights on the spiritual once again. She ventured from Bundasu and joined the Magaambya. She believes that learning the ways of magic will allow her to better understand her own spirit. Kalaggi seeks to return to Bundasu with greater inner knowledge to fulfill her destiny.
 Kalaggi is careful with her words around others. She feels an almost sibling-like bond with Ufi, however, and speaks freely with him.
