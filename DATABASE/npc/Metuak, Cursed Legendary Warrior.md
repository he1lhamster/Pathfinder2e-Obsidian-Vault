# Metuak, Cursed Legendary Warrior

Depending on the teller of the legend, the Burning Mammoth warrior Metuak was either a noble hero or a craven traitor. The truth, of course, lies somewhere between these two extremes.
 When the Great Quake opened a rift to the Abyss in northern Avistan, it sent the native people scrambling for safety. In response to the cataclysm that caused the creation of the Worldwound, the Burning Mammoth following disagreed on what to do with their people's ancestral artifact, the _Primordial Flame_. A small group of rebels (those who became the Broken Tusk) hid the sacred lantern in Red Cat Cave, where it would be safe from demonic hands. The majority of the following, including Metuak, went east to fight the demons, taking the Burning Mammoth banner with them.
 Metuak was one of the Burning Mammoth's bravest and best champions. He seemed immune to demons' temptations and mighty enough to overcome any single fiend. But the demons of the Worldwound were legion, and the Burning Mammoths quickly realized they had no hope of victory without the _Primordial Flame_. The following could scarcely spare a single warrior, so Metuak volunteered to retrieve their sacred artifact.
 No one knew how long this quest would take or what trials he would face. Few dared hope he'd succeed, since the Broken Tusk had placed the _Primordial Flame_ where it would be safe from any thief, mortal or demonic. Metuak proposed a desperate plan: He would allow a demon into his body to grant him the strength necessary to reclaim the flame. Metuak was known to be resilient against the influence of demons, and so the Mammoth Lords agreed. An invidiak named Xeleria—a demon of shadows capable of inhabiting a mortal body—was captured and bound to him.
 At first, Xeleria struggled mightily to corrupt the impervious Metuak, even when the warrior called upon her aid to defeat the ancient cat spirit who guarded the Primordial Flame, Syarstik Painted-Tiger of Red Cat Cave. Together, merging fiendish shadow magic and sheer brawn, the man and the demon slew the cat. In turn, with his dying breath, Syarstik cursed the artifact he guarded. Metuak seized the _Primordial Flame_ and instantly became obsessed, unable to part from it for even a moment without suffering unbearable anguish.
 In this state, Xeleria's magic finally found purchase in Metuak's torment. The invidiak intermittently possessed his body and amused herself with the _Primordial Flame_, scorching the land and terrorizing innocents. Ashamed, Metuak gave up his quest to return the _Primordial Flame_ to his people; instead, he sought a way to lift the curse and somehow separate himself from Xeleria. Metuak heard legends of noble, ancient creatures with knowledge far surpassing that of mortals, and he eventually found the lair of a powerful white dragon named Venexus. Venexus was neither noble nor wise, however, and she wrested the _Primordial Flame_ from Metuak, causing the warrior to flee despite his torment. Metuak knew he'd lost his way, but he trusted his people and ancestors. He sought the advice of the Hillcross Witches, but they banished him from their domain when they learned he'd lost the _Primordial Flame_. Despairing, Metuak wandered through the nearby Tamarnian Tar Forest, where his demonic hanger-on attracted the ire of the nymph who guarded the black woodland. Adalemma the Solstice Queen chased Metuak and his demonic possessor from her realm, and by the time Metuak regained control of his body, he was in the shadow of Castle Grimgorge, a remote Mendevian outpost on the forest's border. Metuak threw himself on the mercy of the soldiers, but they recognized only the demon inside him. The crusaders imprisoned Metuak beneath the castle, extinguishing his last hope. Resigned to his fate, Metuak yielded at last to Xeleria, who called on her demonic allies to descend upon Castle Grimgorge and slaughter the garrison. Sensing that her forest could be next if Xeleria's rampage were permitted to continue, Adalemma magically bound Metuak and Xeleria to their dungeon, where they remained for over a century.

## Campaign Role

In the final chapter of this Adventure Path, the characters break the curse of the _Primordial Flame_ and free Metuak from his eternal torment. To do so, they must face both the ancient warrior and his demonic possessor in the dungeons beneath Grimgorge Castle.
