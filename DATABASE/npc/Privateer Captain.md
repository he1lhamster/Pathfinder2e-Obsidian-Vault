# Privateer Captain

_A faint crust of salt rimes the coattails of this mariner, and her steely eyes gaze from beneath the brim of her tricorne hat._
 Dismissively called a pirate or thief by some, the privateer captain commands a loyal crew that plies the waters of the Inner Sea and beyond. Privateers work for their own profit and reputation, of course, but they also commit themselves to keeping the sea-lanes free from navies that strive to enforce land law on the unbounded waves. Tyrants and slavers are their favorite targets, and many a greedy colonizer or trafficker in flesh has been sent to the bottom of the sea after the captain liberated their cargo. Generally, however, the privateer captain is willing to spare prisoners so that they might be ransomed and spread tales of Firebrands' actions across the region.
 The privateer captain is often at the vanguard of boarding parties. Many call on the power of the fickle goddess Besmara to strengthen their crew in battle and sanctify each shipboard raid. As at home in water as on deck, a privateer captain will gladly leap into the sea to pursue a foe or rescue a fallen crewmate. Though the privateer captain might run under a false flag or attempt to deceive a foe before battle, they generally honor agreements to surrender and make a point to keep their word, particularly when dealing with other Firebrands.

For the ability's duration, enemies within 60 feet of the privateer captain treat the water as turbulent (if it was not already rougher), requiring an Athletics check DC of 20 to Swim, or the water's usual DC, whichever is higher.</span>

### Stella Fane

Captain Stella Fane was the victim of a greed-fueled mutiny when a Chelaxian slaving ring bought her crew and first mate out from under her. No one is certain how she survived—many whisper that she didn't, and the Stella who returned to the seas is actually a ghost. The rumors aren't true, but Stella doesn't correct them. Now armed with a new ship and crew, Stella is on a mission of vengeance against her former shipmates, the slavers of Cheliax, and anyone else who dares support either.
