description: "Tartuccio likes to think of himself as having been hand-picked by [[DATABASE/npc/Castruccio\
  \ Irovetti|King Irovetti]] of Pitax in his mission to claim the Stolen Lands for\
  \ himself, but in fact King Irovetti has never met Tartuccio. The gnome grew up\
  \ in Pitax and, of all that nation's rulers he'd observed, Irovetti impressed him\
  \ the most with his admiration of art and style. That the king wasn't very supportive\
  \ of art styles and pursuits he didn't enjoy never even registered in Tartuccio's\
  \ mind, as his tastes were so similar.<br/><br/> And so Tartuccio set into motion\
  \ plans to catch the king's attention, so as to become first his student, then his\
  \ trusted advisor, and in time his replacement. He even went as far as to seek out,\
  \ research, and learn a potent magical technique that allowed him to change shape,\
  \ intending to use this newfound supernatural power to adjust his appearance to\
  \ be something more pleasing to the king's eye when the time came to petition to\
  \ become his student. Tartuccio spent months scouring the rumor mills for opportunities,\
  \ and when he heard of [[DATABASE/npc/Jamandi Aldori|Lady Jamandi's]] call for heroes\
  \ to expand into the Stolen Lands, he saw his chance. Tartuccio gathered his supplies\
  \ and headed east.<br/><br/> Once the events of Chapter 1 play out, Tartuccio is\
  \ unsettled by the amount of competition he faces. He travels into the Stolen Lands\
  \ where he's heard rumors of a [[DATABASE/ancestry/Kobold|kobold]] settlement that's\
  \ ripe for the taking, uses his ability to change shape to assume the appearance\
  \ of an unusual purple kobold, and work the Sootscales into a sort of private army\
  \ he intends on using to wrest control of the PCs' nation just as they get started.\
