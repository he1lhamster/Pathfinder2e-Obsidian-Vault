###  Tips From The Guide

You might allow PCs who [[DATABASE/action/Follow the Expert|Follow the Expert]] when led by a guide to continue to add their level to the skill check for some time afterward: 1 hour if the guide is an expert, 1 day for master, or 1 week for legendary. (The guide here has expert [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Scouting Lore]], and [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]].) A character can have this benefit for only one skill at a time.
