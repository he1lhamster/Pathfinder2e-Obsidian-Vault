###  Tips From The Guide

You might allow PCs who [[Follow the Expert]] when led by a guide to continue to add their level to the skill check for some time afterward: 1 hour if the guide is an expert, 1 day for master, or 1 week for legendary. (The guide here has expert [[Athletics]], [[Lore]], and [[Survival]].) A character can have this benefit for only one skill at a time.
