# Innkeeper

The sight of an inn is a welcome one to any weary traveler. Innkeepers can often be found cleaning the common room, overseeing the evening meal, or settling in new lodgers. Innkeepers keep an eye on their neighbors' doings and are often excellent sources of information.

**Font of Gossip** The inkeeper's business gives them insight into the neighborhood's happenings. When [[DATABASE/action/Gather Information|Gathering Information]], a person can gain as much information chatting with the innkeeper for 30 minutes to an hour as they would gain from 2 hours spent canvassing the neighborhood. Each person can learn gossip from an innkeeper only once per day, and only if the innkeeper is friendly or helpful to that individual. Whatever information the innkeeper knows about a given topic doesn't change if someone else asks the innkeeper about that topic, unless the innkeeper has since learned more.
**Items** innkeeper's apron (functions as [[DATABASE/armor/Leather Armor|leather armor]]), broom (functions as staff), ledger
