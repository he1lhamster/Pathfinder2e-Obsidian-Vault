On a hit, the seamer slices a strip of flesh from the target and deals 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]] in addition to the war razor's usual damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Quick Stitch** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirements** The Skinsaw seamer is currently grappling a creature; **Effect** The seamer stitches a piece of cloth to the creature's arm, face, or leg, potentially hindering it. The creature must attempt a DC 26 Reflex saving throw; if the seamer has already successfully used their Flay ability against the creature within the past minute, the creature's save result is one degree of success worse.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature takes 1d4 piercing damage.
 **Failure** The creature is [[Clumsy]], [[Dazzled]], [[Enfeebled]], or [[Flat-Footed]] (seamer's choice). This effect lasts until the creature spends a single action to tear out the stitching, which deals 1d6 piercing damage to it.
 **Critical Failure** The creature is clumsy 2, [[Blinded]], enfeebled 2, or flat-footed (seamer's choice). This effect lasts until the creature spends 2 actions to tear out the stitching, which deals 2d6 piercing damage to it.</span>
