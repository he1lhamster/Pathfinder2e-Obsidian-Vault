<span class="in-box-ability">**Wire Catch <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** Every Skinsaw seamer keeps a sewing needle attached to a loop of thick silk, wrapped loosely around their hand not holding a weapon, which they can use in combat to snag or disarm attackers; **Trigger** A creature hits the seamer with a melee Strike; **Effect** The seamer attempts an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to either [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] or [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] the triggering creature.</span>

On a hit, the seamer slices a strip of flesh from the target and deals 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] in addition to the war razor's usual damage.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Quick Stitch** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Requirements** The Skinsaw seamer is currently grappling a creature; **Effect** The seamer stitches a piece of cloth to the creature's arm, face, or leg, potentially hindering it. The creature must attempt a DC 26 Reflex saving throw; if the seamer has already successfully used their Flay ability against the creature within the past minute, the creature's save result is one degree of success worse.
 **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
 **Success** The creature takes 1d4 piercing damage.
 **Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]], [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]], [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] (seamer's choice). This effect lasts until the creature spends a single action to tear out the stitching, which deals 1d6 piercing damage to it.
 **Critical Failure** The creature is clumsy 2, [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]], enfeebled 2, or flat-footed (seamer's choice). This effect lasts until the creature spends 2 actions to tear out the stitching, which deals 2d6 piercing damage to it.</span>
