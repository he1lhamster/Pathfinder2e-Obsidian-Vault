# Tracker

The forest offers dangerous creatures—whether they walk on four legs or two—a place to hide. Dim light, low brush, and fallen leaves conspire to hide their trails. Given these poor conditions, an unskilled eye might spot a sign or two of a creature's passing, but only a skilled tracker can identify several such signs and discern their relationship to each other, connecting one to the next until they form a trail of prints, scat, fur, feathers, and blood that leads to the quarry's lair.

**Forager** While using [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] to [[DATABASE/action/Subsist|Subsist]], if the hunter rolls a failure or a critical failure, they get a success instead. If the hunter rolls a success, they can provide food for 16 additional creatures that eat about as much as a human, or 32 creatures on a critical success.

The tracker gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] the prey and to [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] checks to Track the prey. The first time the tracker hits the designated prey in a round, they deal an additional 1d8 precision damage. The tracker also ignores the penalty for making ranged attacks within their second range increment. These effects last until the tracker uses Hunt Prey again.</span>
