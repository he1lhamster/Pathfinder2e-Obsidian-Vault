# Eleukas, Courageous Guard

Eleukas grew up in Otari, working hard in the logging camps and getting to know the townspeople. When he was old enough to join the Otari town guard, even the curmudgeonly Captain Longsaddle couldn't deny that the muscular lad had martial talent. What he didn't realize is that Eleukas also has heart. Though unsure of his own abilities, Eleukas joined with his friends to avert a serious threat to Otari, as described in _The Shroud of Four Silences_.
 Eleukas is an excellent example of a local folk hero. He's willing to raise his magical axe, _Visperath_, for coin, but he's more likely to raise it to protect the innocent.

## Plot Hooks

Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Eleukas into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.

* Eleukas needs help recovering an escaped prisoner who has made threats on the lives of a local family
* The heroes must defeat a marauding creature that can only be permanently killed by acid damage.
* Eleukas falls victim to some charm or possession effect and the heroes must stop him without killing him.
* While the heroes are investigating strange happenings in Otari, Eleukas lends his aid as someone who can make introductions to helpful townspeople and perhaps even convince Captain Longsaddle to overlook well-intentioned misdemeanors.
