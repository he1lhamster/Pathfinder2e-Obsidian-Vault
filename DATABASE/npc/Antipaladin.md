# Antipaladin

There is perhaps nothing more anathematic to peace than an antipaladin. Dedicated holy warriors to the darkest and foulest of deities, antipaladins work to fulfill the vile wishes of their evil masters. The zeal with which they implement the plans of dark gods makes them truly fearsome foes for anyone allied with the forces of good.

###  Servants Of Destruction

Antipaladins are the polar opposite of [[Paladin]]: chaotic evil warriors devoted to destruction. Much like champions of good, they must follow a code. Their code exhorts evil and prohibits selfless acts. Antipaladins usually serve [[Lamashtu]], [[Rovagug]], or demon lords. Many antipaladins used to be champions of good and seek to destroy their former faiths.
