# Rain-Scribe

_This sharp-eyed half-elf wears weather-beaten gear that would easily blend in with any natural terrain, and carries an elaborately carved walking staff._
 When a group of adepts leaves the Magaambya, whether to investigate a magical phenomenon, conduct a diplomatic mission, or visit scholars in a distant land, a Rain-Scribe often serves as their guide. An expert in travel through difficult environments, the Rain-Scribe provides for their companions while helping them avoid the many hazards of travel in the Inner Sea. Rain-Scribes are some of the most well-traveled members of the academy, and most have secured alliances or promises of safe passage through the lands where they walk.
 Should the Rain-Scribe or their companions be attacked on their journeys, the scribe is a capable combatant who strives to turn their communion with the natural world into their greatest advantage in battle. Whether by using primal magic against their foes or striking unseen from the underbrush, the Rain-Scribe assures that no opponent threatens their traveling companions for long.
