**Guide's Warning** When Vare is about to roll a Perception or [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] check to determine her initiative, she can alert her allies as a free action. Vare visually or audibly warns allies, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls. Depending on how Vare warns allies, this action has the auditory or visual trait.
**Snare Crafting** Vare can use the [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] skill to create the following snares: [[DATABASE/equipment/Alarm Snare|alarm snare]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Hampering Snare|hampering snare]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Irritating Thorn Snare|irritating thorn snare]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Marking Snare|marking snare]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Signaling Snare|signaling snare]], and [[DATABASE/equipment/Smoke Screen Snare|smoke screen snare]]. Vare can create four snares each day without paying for the materials, using 3 Interact actions to set up each snare.
