# Harbormaster

There are three flows important to any port: the seaward and coastal flows, marked by the rise and fall of the tides, and the flow of trade. A harbormaster is expected to know the former two reflexively and encourage the latter while knowing jurisdictional rules of law. Often old hands of the sea, harbormasters find themselves anchored to a port by commitment, conflict, or reputation.

**Steady Balance** Whenever the harbormaster rolls a success on a check to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]], they get a critical success instead. They're not [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] while Balancing on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. They can attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check instead of a Reflex save to [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]].
