# Guildmaster

In cities, artisans working in a common trade often form guilds to set standards of quality, establish common prices, engage in collective bargaining with business owners, and lobby local governments for favorable laws. The guildmaster—often a master artisan in their own right—also acts as an administrator and politician, advocating for artisans in their trade. The guildmaster is a 12th-level challenge when competing in crafting or their area of expertise (architecture in the example below).
