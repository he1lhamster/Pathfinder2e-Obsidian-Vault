# Virtuous Defender

_With his well-worn plate armor and mighty shield, this tall figure appears ready to stand against any foe._
 Even with the fall of the nation of Lastwall, many people still dedicate their lives to opposing the forces and schemes of the Whispering Tyrant. Styling themselves the Shining Sentinels, they see themselves as a bulwark against the further spread of the Tyrant's influence. When not rallying troops to battle against their sworn foe or protecting villages from undead incursions, these knights travel the Inner Sea in hopes of recruiting other righteous souls to fight against the undead hordes.
 Many Shining Sentinels are servants of good deities, such as Iomedae; in battle, they turn their god-given powers against their foes. These virtuous warriors put the safety of their companions before their own and often hold defensive positions to protect their allies.

### Avill Ransford

When Avill's sister chose the path of the crusader, Avill was supportive, eagerly reading all of his sister's letters about her training and religious studies. The final missive Avill received was bursting with pride, as his sister reported that she had been assigned to Vigil. Only months later, Tar-Baphon destroyed the city. Avill now wields a sword in his sister's honor and in his sister's place.
