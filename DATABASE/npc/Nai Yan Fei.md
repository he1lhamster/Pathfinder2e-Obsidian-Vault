  \ \u2014 an elite group of warriors that served the Nai family as bodyguards\u2014\

# Nai Yan Fei

Born in 7195 IC (4695 AR) to the noble Nai family of Goka, Yan Fei's comfortable childhood years were cut short when her parents fell to the blade of assassins during a diplomatic mission, leaving Yan Fei in the care of her grandfather, Nai Hu Buo, then the emperor of Goka.
 For the next 10 years, Hu Buo focused his time and efforts on Yan Fei's care. He trained her in the ins and outs of courtly life, shaping her into a suitable heir to the Nai legacy. Fearing future attempts on Yan Fei's life, Hu Buo also made sure Yan Fei could hold her own, and he tasked the [[Butterfly Blade]]— an elite group of warriors that served the Nai family as bodyguards—to train Yan Fei in martial arts and self-defense. The Butterfly Blades' storied history with the Nai family and Goka made them experts in espionage and intimidation, skills that Yan Fei learned and mastered alongside her grandfather's political expertise.
 By the age of 12, Yan Fei was fully trained in the arts of both combat and public affairs. Satisfied with his granddaughter's skill, Hu Buo returned to the world of Gokan politics, receiving an exuberant welcome from the people of Goka. Shortly thereafter, Hu Buo earned an unprecedented third term as emperor of Goka. Meanwhile, Yan Fei continued her training with the Butterfly Blades.

Campaign Role
The player characters get their first chance to meet the empress and make a good impression on the powerful ruler in Chapter 3 of this adventure. Nai Yan Fei continues to serve as an important figure in the following adventures as a potential guide and information-provider, and the characters' interaction with her on Bonmu will determine what kind of relationship they have with the empress going forward. If the characters manage to win her over, they'll meet the kind aristocrat who's rightly earned the admiration of Goka's common folk. On the other hand, if their impression proves less than favorable, the characters must instead contend with a calculating politician who deftly navigates the minefields of diplomacy and etiquette—a ruthless empress who knows how to make the most of a group like the player characters before casting them aside when their worth has run its course.
