# Duhgik, Kobold Trapsmith

After her tribe exiled her for not adhering to some of their more ruthless traditions, Duhgik was forced to live on the surface in the too-too bright sunshine. She found solace in the deep shade of the forest's tree canopy among the verdant foliage of various plants and edible mosses. Duhgik that the environment matched her own green scales well, and has since become an expert at hiding among the big-big trees.
 When Duhgik found the cruelty of her old kobold tribe reflected in the cruelty of hunters and poachers in the forest, she set out on a personal mission to help the critters of the woods by disarming poachers' snares and setting up some of her own. She strives to rid her woods of the would-be hunters who only care about trophies and leave the rest of the animal to rot—what a waste. As long as visitors to her forest are kind to the land and animals, Duhgik leaves them alone.

## Plot Hooks

Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Duhgik into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.

* A local noble or prominent merchant hires the heroes, describing a terrible attack they suffered in the woods by a terrifying creature the last time they were out hunting game—likely an [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ogre|ogre]], [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Troll|troll]], or some other vicious creature. In truth, these claims are an exaggeration, and the embarrassed noble fell victim to one of Duhgik's traps and simply embellishes the threat to save face.
* While traveling through the woods, the heroes come across a series of traps, each more dangerous than the last. A voice high in the trees tells them to flee or face the wrath of the “very-big-mean dragon” that protects the forest and its inhabitants.
* Duhgik meets the heroes while on a trip into town to buy supplies and sell some of her snares to hunters she trusts to use them honorably. She asks them to help her with a particularly aggressive magical beast that has been avoiding her snares and killing all the wildlife near her home.
