# Fence

The longer criminals hold on to stolen loot, the greater the chance they will get caught. Fences make themselves indispensable in the underworld by paying for stolen goods in order to resell them later, whether through a seemingly legitimate business or to a closed group of elite buyers.

**Fence's Eye** Fences live by their ability to recognize a viable trade. They can use [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Underworld Lore]] to identify an item's value and [[DATABASE/action/Identify Magic|Identify Magic]] on an item. They gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Underworld Lore checks when doing so, and to Underworld Lore checks to determine whether an item was stolen, whether a stolen item would be too recognizable to easily move, and who would be interested in purchasing such an item.
