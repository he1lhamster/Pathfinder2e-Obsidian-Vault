description: "<i>Discontent with Mengkare, Emaliza schemes with her brother Uri of\
  \ the Scarlet Triad, intending to become a powerful figure in Promise so that she\
  \ can one day take full control of the city.</i><br/><br/> Much like her brother\
  \ Uri, Emaliza received excellent education and continual care while growing up\
  \ in Promise, but rather than focus on physical training like her brother, Emaliza\
  \ chose to sharpen her mind. She dove into her arcane studies with great enthusiasm,\
  \ marveling at the power and control magic could give her, only to find herself\
  \ frustrated by Promise's restrictions and Mengkare's demands.<br/><br/> Uri eventually\
  \ left Promise to serve Mengkare as a recruiter, leaving Emaliza to climb the political\
  \ ladder in the Council of Enlightenment. Emaliza delighted in every message and\
  \ letter from her brother, marveling at the opportunities those in the world beyond\
  \ Hermea's shores had to seize power for themselves. Emaliza's appreciation for\
  \ such prospects grew stronger after Uri returned from his multiyear mission and\
  \ regaled her with tales of ambitious and powerful people encountered in his travels.\
  \ It was then the siblings began to refine their plans for taking control of Hermea.<br/><br/>\
  \ Emaliza masterminded these plots and, realizing that the support of a distant\
  \ but well-funded organization would support their goals, suggested that Uri leave\
  \ Promise again to take control of the Scarlet Triad. She secretly began to investigate\
  \ Mengkare, attempting to find weaknesses she could exploit. Unable to access the\
  \ deepest archives of the palace due to the restrictions imposed by her citizenship,\
  \ Emaliza focused on ingratiating herself to Mengkare instead. In time, she learned\
  \ about Alseta's Ring, the imprisoned manifestation of Dahak, and the shards of\
  \ the [[DATABASE/equipment/Orb of Dragonkind|Orb of Gold Dragonkind]] . The details\
  \ of Mengkare's plan eluded her, but she decided they were irrelevant. If she could\
  \ rebuild the orb and control Mengkare, and if she could claim Alseta's Ring and\
  \ weaponize the divine entity trapped within, the resulting power would be more\
  \ than enough to meet her needs. She spent years gaining Mengkare's favor and furthering\
  \ her position within the Council of Enlightenment, eventually becoming that organization's\
  \ senior member, second only to the dragon.<br/><br/> Decades later, Emaliza secured\
  \ permission from Mengkare to make her first voyage beyond Hermea's borders\u2014\
  a trip to Katapesh to review the Scarlet Triad's finances and efficiency. She'd\
  \ already been working to hide the Triad's dealings with slavery, but now she revealed\
  \ to Uri what she'd learned. She gave Uri the few shards of the <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i>\
  \ she'd managed to recover, asked him to gather more shards and organize the orb's\
  \ repair, and then returned to Hermea to set the stage for her coup.<br/><br/> Today,\
  \ as the high councilor, Emaliza has access to almost all of Hermea's resources.\
  \ She has been using this access to continue supporting the Scarlet Triad in secret,\
  \ partially shoring up the losses the group suffered when Mengkare cut its funding.<br/><br/>\
  \ Emaliza is an arrogant woman, believing herself to be the pinnacle of intelligence\
  \ and an incomparable mastermind. The fact that she's been able to keep the efforts\
  \ of the Scarlet Triad a secret from Mengkare for so long only reinforces her self-assessment\
  \ and the indulgence of her ego. When speaking with others, she is curt and pedantic,\

# Emaliza Zandivar

_Discontent with Mengkare, Emaliza schemes with her brother Uri of the Scarlet Triad, intending to become a powerful figure in Promise so that she can one day take full control of the city._
 Much like her brother Uri, Emaliza received excellent education and continual care while growing up in Promise, but rather than focus on physical training like her brother, Emaliza chose to sharpen her mind. She dove into her arcane studies with great enthusiasm, marveling at the power and control magic could give her, only to find herself frustrated by Promise's restrictions and Mengkare's demands.
 Uri eventually left Promise to serve Mengkare as a recruiter, leaving Emaliza to climb the political ladder in the Council of Enlightenment. Emaliza delighted in every message and letter from her brother, marveling at the opportunities those in the world beyond Hermea's shores had to seize power for themselves. Emaliza's appreciation for such prospects grew stronger after Uri returned from his multiyear mission and regaled her with tales of ambitious and powerful people encountered in his travels. It was then the siblings began to refine their plans for taking control of Hermea.
 Emaliza masterminded these plots and, realizing that the support of a distant but well-funded organization would support their goals, suggested that Uri leave Promise again to take control of the Scarlet Triad. She secretly began to investigate Mengkare, attempting to find weaknesses she could exploit. Unable to access the deepest archives of the palace due to the restrictions imposed by her citizenship, Emaliza focused on ingratiating herself to Mengkare instead. In time, she learned about Alseta's Ring, the imprisoned manifestation of Dahak, and the shards of the [[Orb of Dragonkind]]. The details of Mengkare's plan eluded her, but she decided they were irrelevant. If she could rebuild the orb and control Mengkare, and if she could claim Alseta's Ring and weaponize the divine entity trapped within, the resulting power would be more than enough to meet her needs. She spent years gaining Mengkare's favor and furthering her position within the Council of Enlightenment, eventually becoming that organization's senior member, second only to the dragon.
 Decades later, Emaliza secured permission from Mengkare to make her first voyage beyond Hermea's borders—a trip to Katapesh to review the Scarlet Triad's finances and efficiency. She'd already been working to hide the Triad's dealings with slavery, but now she revealed to Uri what she'd learned. She gave Uri the few shards of the _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ she'd managed to recover, asked him to gather more shards and organize the orb's repair, and then returned to Hermea to set the stage for her coup.
 Today, as the high councilor, Emaliza has access to almost all of Hermea's resources. She has been using this access to continue supporting the Scarlet Triad in secret, partially shoring up the losses the group suffered when Mengkare cut its funding.
 Emaliza is an arrogant woman, believing herself to be the pinnacle of intelligence and an incomparable mastermind. The fact that she's been able to keep the efforts of the Scarlet Triad a secret from Mengkare for so long only reinforces her self-assessment and the indulgence of her ego. When speaking with others, she is curt and pedantic, except when she recognizes that kindness could be of more use. In this case, she adopts a persona appearing overly curious and almost naive to make her seem more innocent and unassuming.

## Campaign Role

Emaliza spends most of her time during this adventure away from the PCs. She is unsure if the PCs know about the _Orb of Dragonkind's_ abilities or whether she even has the orb. It's likely that Emaliza knows full well the PCs' role in defeating the Scarlet Triad, but with the faulty orb in her hands, she considers Uri's work a success, even if she doesn't particularly mourn his death (less power to share in the end, after all). She considers the PCs to be dupes powerful enough to trick into securing resources and information from the archives, and she hopes they can reach that part of the Golden Citadel and gather information for her.
 If Uri escaped death in the previous adventure, Emaliza keeps his return to Promise a secret. The PCs may hear rumors that Uri lives, but he should not make an appearance until the final confrontation when the PCs fight Emaliza, at which point Uri appears at her side, just in time to join the fight.
 Emaliza keeps [[Mage Armor]] active at all times; it's listed as one of her 8th-level spells but has already been cast for the day.
