# Pr'rall, Catfolk Stalker

A hunter at heart, Pr'rall takes bounties throughout Avistan and Garund on anything from cockatrices to bandits. Gold pays the bills, but the thrill of the hunt is the reason he always takes the next job. Lately, Pr'rall has found the most satisfaction from hunting sapient creatures; he relishes the moment before the final strike when he knows that he's won and his prey will fall under his blade. He's begun to look into more than just bounty hunting, and is considering joining a local assassin's guild, though he's not sure if he wants to fully embrace his growing bloodlust.

## Plot Hooks

Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Pr'rall into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.

* The heroes need to take down a particularly difficult foe and hire Pr'rall to help them hunt the target down.
* Pr'rall's ancestral [[Temple Sword]] is stolen from him but he's run out of leads in tracking it down. He asks the heroes to help him find out who has it so he can hunt them down and ensure they never steal from him again.
* A rich and powerful noble has been thwarted by the PCs too many times. He's hired Pr'rall to hunt them down and bring them back: alive if possible, dead if necessary. Given the catfolk's growing proclivity for killing, it's likely he'll find a way to force the PCs' hands.
