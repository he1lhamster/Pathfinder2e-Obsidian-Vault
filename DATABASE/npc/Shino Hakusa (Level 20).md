She makes a fingers Strike. On a hit, the target takes damage as normal and must attempt a DC 43 Fortitude save. Regardless of the result of the save, the target is then temporarily immune to Pressure Point Attack for 1 minute. 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Success** The target's muscles become temporarily weaker. For 1 round, the target is [[Enfeebled]], and any time it attempts to take an action with the manipulate trait, the action is disrupted unless it succeeds at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + its enfeebled value. 
**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute. 
**Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute, the flat check is DC 11, and the target takes a –10-foot status penalty to all Speeds for the duration.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[Sneak Attack]]** Hakusa's Strikes deal an extra 5d6 precision damage to flat-footed creatures.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Swallows in Flight** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (certain kill, necromancy, negative) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** Hakusa strikes a series of pressure points on her target's body that redirects its ki to the heart, before following up with a palm strike to the sternum. She makes a fingers Strike and a palm Strike, dealing damage as normal. If both hit, the target takes 8d10 negative damage as its life energy escapes from its body in a shower of bird-shaped sparks. The target attempts a DC 43 Fortitude save. 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Success** The target takes half the negative damage. 
**Failure** The target takes full damage, its life energy exploding violently from its back in a 30-foot cone originating from the target. All of Hakusa's other enemies in the cone also take the negative damage (DC 43 basic Fortitude save). 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double negative damage.</span>
