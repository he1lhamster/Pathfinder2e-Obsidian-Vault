# Merchant

Small settlements can typically support one or two generalist merchants, and larger cities house multiple specialists—experts in one type of product. Merchants can be found anywhere: vendors hustling in the public square, shopkeepers running small storefronts, traveling salespeople in carriages or caravans, or wealthy tycoons running entire organizations devoted to commerce. For encounters involving negotiation or mercantile skill, a merchant is a 4th—level challenge. A merchant might have an additional [[Lore]] skill about a specific category of item (such as jewelry or magic weapons), with a total skill bonus 2 higher than Mercantile Lore.
