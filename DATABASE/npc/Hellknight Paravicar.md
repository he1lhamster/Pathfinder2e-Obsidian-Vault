# Hellknight Paravicar

_Face covered by a menacing helm and body clad in ornate plate, this figure projects an aura of immutable authority_.
 Each order of Hellknights is led by a powerful paravicar, a general in charge of dictating the order's tactics and the administration of its resources. Within the order, the word of these figures is law, and members from the lowliest squire to the most senior knight follow commands from a paravicar with unswerving devotion. Paravicars see their personal dedication to the order's edicts as an example for all members and hold themselves to the same high standards as their underlings. Though they seldom need to call upon them, paravicars use their considerable infernal powers to reinforce their positions in the Hellknight's hierarchy.
 In combat, paravicars take direct command of their troops of knights and armigers. Paravicars are experienced campaigners who prefer calculated tactical gambits to hot-headed, risky maneuvers that could leave their forces exposed. If pressed into combat, paravicars use their abilities to demoralize their foes and compel enemies to become their allies or to flee the field.

### Sergia Novellia

The battle to enforce order is the driving force behind all Hellknights, but it's more personal for Sergia Novellia. In her early days as an armiger, she and her companions accidentally fell through a rift to the Plane of Shadow and fell prey to the cruel ministrations of the velstracs. Though eventually rescued by a pair of Nidalese shadowcallers, Sergia returned with scars on both mind and body. She now hides her features behind terrifying armor, though she actually delights in the gruesome appearance it gives her. Sergia serves the rigid Order of the Godclaw to enforce her iron control on both society and herself.
