# Hunter

As is reflected in the many depictions of an elk-headed [[DATABASE/deity/Erastil|Erastil]], god of the hunt, the hunter is very much a creature of the forest, known by the forest and familiar with every aspect of it. After all, the final determination of who is the hunter and who is prey often depends on who is able to make an ally of the terrain.

**Forager** While using [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] to [[DATABASE/action/Subsist|Subsist]], if the hunter rolls a failure or a critical failure, they get a success instead. If the hunter rolls a success, they can provide food for 16 additional creatures that eat about as much as a human, or 32 creatures on a critical success.
**Forest Walker** The hunter ignores the effects of difficult terrain from a forest environment. They can [[DATABASE/action/Sneak|Sneak]] through underbrush without the need to attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check as long as the hunter moves no more than 5 feet at a time and is not within 10 feet of an enemy at any point during their movement.

The hunter gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] the prey and to [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] checks to Track the prey. The first time the hunter hits the designated prey in a round, they deal an additional 1d8 precision damage. The hunter also ignores the penalty for making ranged attacks within their second range increment. These effects last until the hunter uses Hunt Prey again.</span>
