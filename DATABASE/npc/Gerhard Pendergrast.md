 When firing the blunderbuss, Gerhard must succeed at a DC 20 [[Crafting]] or [[Lore]] check or the weapon explodes, damaging him for the same amount as the creatures in the cone and destroying itself. If someone other than Gerhard uses the weapon, they must critically succeed at the check. A successful DC 22 Crafting check is enough to confirm the weapon's unstable nature if someone examines it beforehand.
 Reloading the blunderbuss takes 3 Interact actions: adding 1 dose of gunpowder, adding 1 grapeshot canister, and packing the contents.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Whip Swing** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (move) **Requirement** Gerhard is in a jungle, dense forest, or an area with numerous overhead beams. **Effect** Gerhard uses his whip to lash upward to wrap around an overhanging tree branch; he then swings up to 30 feet in a straight line, and must end the movement on solid ground or fall.</span>
