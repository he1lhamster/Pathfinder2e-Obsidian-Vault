The hermit gains a +1 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls made against that target until he chooses a different target to Focus Hatred on. The target must attempt a DC 22 Will save, with the below effects. The hateful hermit cannot Focus Hatred again for 1d4 rounds.
 **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Focus Hatred for 24 hours.
 **Success** The target is distracted by the hatred and is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against the hermit's next attack.
 **Failure** The hermit's words unnerve the target and distract them; the target is flat-footed until the end of the hateful hermit's next turn.
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is flat-footed for 1 minute.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]** The hateful hermit deals 2d6 extra precision damage to [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] creatures.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Trackless Step** The hateful hermit always gains the benefits of [[DATABASE/action/Cover Tracks|Cover Tracks]] in natural surroundings, even when moving at full speed.</span>
