# Ekene

Many in the Mwangi Expanse believe Ekujae elves are dedicated isolationists, but they are actually close allies of the Magaambya. On a trip to deliver relics there, two Ekujae lore-bearers brought their daughter, Ekene. After concluding their business, they told Ekene that she was to stay and learn. Her first lonely night in the dormitory was also the first time the serious young elf ever wept.
 Ekene spent her youth training to be one of the Ekujae's defenders. She believed the warrior's road was her life's path, not that of a scholar. She works hard at her studies to make her parents proud, even though she still doesn't feel like she belongs. Ekene's traditional Ekujae paint markings have faded since her arrival and she has intentionally chosen not to reapply them. She hopes to have her family apply new markings upon her return that better represent the person she will become upon leaving the Magaambya, whether or not it's who they expect her to be.
 Ekene is generally amiable, but is particularly close with Muruwa, as the two share a love for climbing trees and spending time outdoors.
