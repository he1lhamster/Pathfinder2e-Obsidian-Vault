# Poacher

Some forests are protected by kings, others only by wild things. Laws against hunting may protect the private reserves of nobles or guard the viability of animal populations of shared forests during specific seasons. Poachers violate those laws—sometimes out of greed, sometimes out of desperation, and sometimes for sport. Although penalties against poaching often include public shaming (see Penalties for Poaching), in lean times a successful poacher is a local hero.

**Forager** While using [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] to [[DATABASE/action/Subsist|Subsist]], if the hunter rolls a failure or a critical failure, they get a success instead. If the hunter rolls a success, they can provide food for 4 additional creatures that eat about as much as a human, or 8 creatures on a critical success.
**Snare Crafting** The poacher can use the [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] skill to create the following snares: [[DATABASE/equipment/Alarm Snare|alarm snare]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Hampering Snare|hampering snare]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Marking Snare|marking snare]], and [[DATABASE/equipment/Signaling Snare|signaling snare]]. The poacher can create four snares each day without paying for the materials, using 3 Interact actions to set up each snare.

###  Penalties For Poaching

Punishment for poaching on noble land can be vicious. Maiming poachers by removing fingers is a common practice. Crueler punishments include snaring poachers in their own traps and leaving them helpless, or binding them in the bloody skins of their catch and setting dogs to chase them through the woods.
