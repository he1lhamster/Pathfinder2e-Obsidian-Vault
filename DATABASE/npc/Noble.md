# Noble

Envied by many and detested by still others, nobles exude confidence and gentility. Gossip and gambling are often nobles' favorite pastimes. Day-to-day life for a noble is often a mixture of business and leisure, and to an onlooker, such a lifestyle can appear to be nothing more than a string of meals, parties, and game halls. However, despite what some might believe, life as a noble is often quite dangerous and requires far more intellect than it would appear—along with a healthy dose of suspicion.
