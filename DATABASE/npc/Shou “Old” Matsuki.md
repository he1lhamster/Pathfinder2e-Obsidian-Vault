# Shou "Old" Matsuki, Popular Local Old-Timer

At the tender age of 10, Shou Matsuki was already part of the family carpentry business and participating in the construction of the monastery. A few weeks short of being 99 years old this year, Shou is the only human left in Willowshore who has experienced the village's entire history in person. He fondly remembers the vibrant days when pilgrims filled the streets, speaks highly of his fellow migrant workers in the decade when they sought work outside the village, and grumbles about Lung Wa's takeover.
 Outwardly, Old Matsuki is a belligerent elderly man who prefers alcohol over tea, thinks the Northridge faction is always up to no good, and laments at the brothel's transformation into an inn. In private, everyone knows he has a soft spot for the future of Willowshore's culture, traditions, and people. During the monster invasion, his mind remains sharp and focused as he organizes Southbank to fortify their position, buying precious time for the surviving villagers to figure out how they might take Willowshore back.

## Campaign Use

If Shou Matsuki becomes Willowshore's interim governor, he favors Southbank's farmers and traditions. This development makes it easier for the PCs to prepare the town's food stores for the coming winter, but at the cost of not having a head start at shoring up the town's defenses in the coming months. 
Once the town of Willowshore is safe at the start of Chapter 3, the PCs can attempt to interact with Old Matsuki using the Influence subsystem. An influence encounter with Old Matsuki is a 3rd-level challenge, and an influence round with him takes 1 hour. If any attempt to Influence him results in a critical failure and the PCs have fewer than 5 Influence Points with him, he uses his Respect your Elders! ability against that PC soon thereafter.
