# The Prince Of Wolves, Abyssal Crime Lord

The Prince of Wolves was once no more than a midlevel beastkin crime lord named Khaaroz, a conniving conspirator who'd spent nearly two decades building up a criminal network in the Abyssal city of Alushinyrra. His plans crumbled to ashes when the ruler of the city, [[DATABASE/deity/Nocticula|Nocticula]], left the Midnight Isles to ascend from demon lord to goddess. Khaaroz fled Alushinyrra as it fell into chaos, hijacking a warship from the city harbor. After securing command over the crew by killing their previous captain, Khaaroz made his way to a relatively tiny island on the outskirts of the Midnight Isles, where he led his crew on a raid that resulted in the capture of the isle's previous ruler—a [[DATABASE/monster/Vavakia|vavakia]] tyrant named Mogaran.
 In the treasury of the fallen ruler's keep, Khaaroz discovered a collection of harrow cards, including ancient Varisian versions of several lost cards. He became fascinated and obsessed, particularly with a rare card called the Prince of Wolves—a card he felt symbolized him to perfection. Khaaroz learned more about the history of the cards, and he sent agents beyond the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] into Golarion to acquire them if possible. To many of his minions, Khaaroz was known only as the Prince of Wolves, a name he took from that intriguing harrow card he found among Mogaran's treasures.
 From his fixation on the harrow, Khaaroz became convinced that a great transformation awaited him in the future. At first, he suspected this transformation was an ascension from his mortal form into that of a full-fledged demon. After ensuring his new island home, now called “The Den,” was secure, Khaaroz left the Abyss to travel to Golarion in search of this great change.
 Not long after, he was contacted by a man named Drustan. Khaaroz thought Drustan something of a fool but was intrigued by his offer to join a group who sought to use the harrow to remake reality. Soon enough, as the Prince of Wolves, Khaaroz became one of the three leaders of the Unmatched. In the Varisian harrower Raven, Khaaroz found all the wisdom and intellect he sought, and while outwardly he appeared to work with the others, his true goal was always to seize the _Deck of Destiny_ for himself and to use it to unlock his true potential. When the Scattering spread the _Deck of Destiny_ throughout the world, Khaaroz only just managed to resist attacking the other Unmatched in a fit of frustration. Once again, he faced what he felt was an unfair disruption to his plans, similar to what had occurred years before with Nocticula's abandoning of Alushinyrra. Yet, he hid his anger and set off on his own to gather up as many of the cards as he could, reasoning that he'd be able to take those gathered by Raven and Drustan when the time came.

## Campaign Role

The Prince of Wolves has already gathered some cards from the _Deck of Destiny_ when this adventure begins. While he loans three of these to his agents in the first part of the adventure in order to aid their invasion of the Harrow Court, he retains three others (in addition to, potentially, any that may have slipped through the PCs' fingers over the course of the Adventure Path). He is this adventure's primary antagonist and unlikely to survive the events of “The Destiny War.” If he does, he can continue to vex the PCs into the next adventure, potentially joining up with Raven to help her finish her plans.
