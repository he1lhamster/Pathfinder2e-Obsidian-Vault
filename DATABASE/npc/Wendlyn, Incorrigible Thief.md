# Wendlyn, Incorrigible Thief

Wendlyn grew up in Otari and knows just about everyone in it. This means she knows which people are safe to target with her petty larceny. She's been on the wrong side of Captain Longsaddle of the Otari town guard for as long as she can remember, but she keeps away from the sorts of crimes that would call for serious punishment, or that would seriously hurt anyone. The people of Otari are immune to her thefts but not her pranks; she's fond of hiding animals where they'll surprise people or livening up a celebration with some unexpected fireworks. She considers it to be all in good fun. Captain Longsaddle would definitely disagree, as would her younger half-sister, the pious acolyte Lisavet. 
 Wendlyn is an excellent person to become acquainted with in Otari, as she knows a fair share of the town's secrets. Her lifelong inclination toward theft also makes her just the right person to disable a tricky lock or disarm a complicated trap. She's eager to join just about any escapade, illicit or otherwise, as long as no one seems likely to get seriously hurt.

## Plot Hooks

Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Wendlyn into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.

* Wendlyn needs the heroes to help her recover a hand mirror she stole from an abandoned house and then fenced, as she didn't realize its presence was keeping a ghost confined to the old house. She hopes to recover the mirror from the fence and get it back into the house before anyone's hurt.
* One of the heroes is an alibi who can prove Wendlyn wasn't at the scene of a crime that Captain Longsaddle is certain she committed. The heroes must work to prove the thief's innocence—in this particular matter, at least.
* The heroes have come across a strange puzzle box that defies all attempts to open it, but an expert locksmith like Wendlyn might be able to help.
* Through her shady contacts, Wendlyn has heard of a plot to smuggle drugs into Otari's harbor late at night. She hopes to intercept the smugglers, dump the drugs into the harbor's waters, and teach the smugglers to stay out of her town.
