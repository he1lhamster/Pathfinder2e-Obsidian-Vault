The passing of knowledge and traditions from generation to generation is a time-honored occupation. Teachers exist to strengthen their populations with literacy, history, and advanced sciences, but most of all with inspiration. Most teachers provide general knowledge so their students are well rounded, but some are experts or even masters of a single discipline. A teacher typically knows three languages in addition to Common. For academic encounters, a teacher is a 4th-level challenge.
