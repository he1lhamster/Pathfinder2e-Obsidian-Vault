If the guard moves to follow the target, this movement doesn't trigger reactions. In addition, if the target has to stop moving because it would hit an object, it takes damage equal to the guard's Strength modifier.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Sudden Charge** <span class="action-icon">2</span> The Promise guard Strides up to double their Speed.
