# Pathfinder Venture-Captain

_The barnacle-crusted armor of this dwarf hints at a thousand exciting tales._
 The venture-captains of the Pathfinder Society rose through the ranks of the organization by following a unique path. An individual venture-captain has overcome numerous challenges, and each has countless stories to tell—and the scars to go with them. Each venture-captain maintains a lodge somewhere in the Inner Sea, where Pathfinder agents can rest, share stories, and set out on new missions. The venture-captain assigns these missions themselves, and they can draw on the significant resources of the Pathfinder Society—as well as any local allies they have—to ensure the missions' success.
 This venture-captain operates a lodge that also serves as a tavern. His interest in epic tales led him to join the Society, and he gladly shares these stories with interested parties. Opportunistic field agents can gain the venture-captain's favor by recovering unique and valuable liquors. The venture-captain hopes to one day publish a Pathfinder Chronicle of his own.

### Khoumrock Blackthane

The epitome of a salty sea dog, Khoumrock has experienced a lot in his tenure as a Pathfinder. Sunk and trapped beneath the waves, kidnapped by [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Alghollthu|alghollthus]], rescued from alghollthus—if there's an adventure to be found underwater, Khoumrock has experienced it. These days, Khoumrock prefers to keep his feet on solid ground, though he's always eager to share his stories to wide-eyed new recruits. For all his hardships, nothing has ever matched the wonders and thrills of the mysterious world he traversed below the ocean, and Khoumrock is happy to help others explore that incredible place—and live to tell tales of their adventures.
