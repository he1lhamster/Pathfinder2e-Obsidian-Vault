# Syndara The Sculptor

From the moment of his creation, Syndara was drawn to patterns. Though all axiomites strive to bring order in a chaotic world—many through acts of creation—Syndara took this a step further than his fellow inhabitants of [[DATABASE/plane/Axis|Axis]], not by crafting clever artifices, but by creating entire pocket realities of mathematically precise shapes and spirals. For many years, Syndara was the premier artist of Axis, until one day a ruby-haired sorcerer arrived at the city's gates.
 The two were immediate kindred spirits. But time passed and Syndara grew jealous of Hao Jin's innate gifts. His creations grew crueler and more depraved, his “art” seeking to shock as if to make up for a self-perceived deficit in ability. Hao Jin realized that while Syndara had always desired to cultivate order from chaos, he also wished to impose his own idea of how the world should be on others—by force if necessary. After a great struggle, Hao Jin defeated her old friend. She could not bear to destroy him, though, and instead imprisoned him within his own demiplane-in-progress, the _Glass Lighthouse_. She further secured him by placing the _Glass Lighthouse_ in her own demiplane, the _Hao Jin Tapestry_, which amplified the effects and duration of his imprisonment. Syndara spent eons trapped in a flow of turbulent time, consumed with thoughts of revenge. Now that he is free from his cage, Syndara seeks to humiliate and kill Hao Jin then claim her magic for himself.

## Campaign Role

Syndara is the ultimate villain of this Adventure Path and has been manipulating events behind the scenes since before the start of this decade's Ruby Phoenix Tournament. He recruited the Lightkeepers to enter the tournament and gather information on the other teams, and he also orchestrated Mogaru's attack on Goka to force a direct confrontation with Hao Jin on his own demiplane, the one place he stood a chance of defeating her. He orchestrates his Hungry Ghost Tournament on his demiplane island both as an insult to Hao Jin and to delay the party so he has time to recover from his duel with the Ruby Phoenix. Once the player characters reach the _Glass Lighthouse_, Syndara begins to see them as Hao Jin's successors and will stop at nothing to utterly destroy them.

**Spatial Sense** Syndara instinctively knows the position of all creatures and objects within the _Glass Lighthouse_ as a precise sense. His senses do not extend into extraplanar spaces, even if the entrance to these spaces is within the _Lighthouse_ (such as a creature within a [[DATABASE/equipment/Bag of Holding|bag of holding]]).

Syndara or Syndara's Reflection can't use Planar Restructuring for 1d4 rounds.

If he critically hits with a melee Strike, he can target the eyes, joints, or other weak points to add one of the following effects of his choice unless the target succeeds on a DC 46 Fortitude save.

He Strides twice. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.
