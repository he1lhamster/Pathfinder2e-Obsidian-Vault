# Jailer

A jailer's primary responsibility is to keep prisoners from escaping. Jailers must often use force, or the threat of force, to keep their charges in line, as even the most carefully crafted cells, manacles, or chains can fail with time and persistence when the prisoners have the will to attempt an escape.
