# Muruwa

Muruwa grew up in the jungles just outside Nantambu, her village high aloft in the treetops towering just outside the city. She spent her younger days sneaking away from her village to explore Nantambu, and the need to avoid watchful eyes, be they grippli or Nantambiyan, quickly taught Muruwa the necessity of stealth. While she initially used her sojourns into the city to make off with sweets and other snacks, Muruwa found herself returning to learn more about the city's people. It was during one of these visits that Muruwa learned of the Magaambya and began to develop a fascination with magic.
 As her curiosity grew, Muruwa decided to enroll in the Magaambya, and so she set out for Nantambu one last time. After arriving, the intrepid grippli took to living on the streets and earning coin through various odd jobs. Once she saved enough money to buy her first set of supplies, she enrolled in the academy. Muruwa now dedicates most of her time to learning all that she can about magic and the world beyond the jungle she calls home.
 Muruwa has a difficult time relating with others and takes a while to open up. She's found that sharing stories about life in the jungle with Kalaggi comes naturally, though, and Muruwa considers the Ekujae elf to be her closest friend at the academy.
