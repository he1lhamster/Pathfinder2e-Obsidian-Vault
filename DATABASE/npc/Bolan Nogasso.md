# Bolan Nogasso

Druidism draws some adherents because they love nature—and others because they hate people. Bolan Nogasso has always been the latter. Bolan grew up in the logging camps of Andoran, the son of parents with too many offspring and too little affection. Shy and scrawny, he found himself a target of constant abuse from burly loggers' children, including his own siblings. He took to spending as much time as possible hiding in the woods. There, in the quiet among the trees, he could fnally let his guard down. In time, he managed to befriend local fey, including pixies and brownies. Bolan began to pray that he'd turn out to be a changeling—anything but the child of boorish humans.
 Time and again, the same story would play out: Bolan would return to a favorite grove and fnd it clear-cut, his fey friends nowhere to be found. As he grew older, he flled out, and he used his new strength to fght these atrocities. Yet the loggers— those same childhood chums who'd spent their lives bullying him—only laughed as they bloodied his nose. Hopeless, he tried to drink his troubles away. It was on one of these benders that he frst heard of Sevenarches. In Sevenarches, people served nature, rather than the other way around. Guards called Oakstewards reminded citizens of the delicate balance between the needs of humanoids and those of plants and animals. Bolan set out immediately, vowing not to rest until he was apprenticed to these sagacious druids. It worked: Bolan excelled in his training and soon became a full Oaksteward. With his knowledge and magic, he felt closer to the natural world than ever— while also appreciating the distance his status put between him and Sevenarches' deferential citizens. Yet his joy was short-lived. Bolan soon realized that, for all their talk of balance, the Oakstewards actually put humanoid interests frst. He began to clash more and more with his superiors, eventually seeing them as just another petty hierarchy that was more concerned with international politics than truly safeguarding the natural world.

 **Campaign Role**
 Though the primary antagonist for the frst chapter of the adventure, Bolan is ultimately a patsy—a desperate zealot who's become a pawn in Kaneepo the Slim's wicked game. Kaneepo has no problem with the rebel Oaksteward's genocidal goals. The fey only needs Bolan to steal the Shadewither Key, with which Kaneepo can expand their territory and pursue their own vengeance against the elves of Kyonin. Bolan is at once a tragic fgure and a dangerous foe, quick to spout proclamations about civilization's unchecked growth. Although he cares little for the other Oakstewards who've joined his cause, he genuinely feels for his fey allies, and he's surprisingly tolerant of their shenanigans.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Guardian Thorns** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (conjuration, primal) Bolan compels plant-based materials within 10 feet of him to grow sharp thorns and spiky branches. This ability affects all walls, floors, and large objects made from dead organic material, such as wood. Affected areas become difficult terrain. Non-fey and non-plant creatures in the affected area or those who move through an affected square take 2d10 piercing damage (DC 18 basic Reflex save). This ability does not affect stone, dirt, living plants, or other materials. The effect ends when Bolan moves out of his square.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Item Treachery** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (primal, transmutation) Bolan targets a held item (such as a bow stave, wooden shield, or scroll) within 60 feet composed, at least partially, of wood, cotton, or other dead plant matter. The plant-based part of this item animates and attempts to wriggle free of its holder's grasp. The holder must attempt a DC 18 Reflex save.
 **Success** The creature holds onto the item with no ill effect.
 **Failure** The creature struggles to hold onto the item. Until the start of the creature's next turn, attempts to [[Disarm]] the creature of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item.
 **Critical Failure** The creature drops the item into the creature's space or drops the object in an adjacent square of Bolan's choice, at which point the item returns to normal.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Vengeful Fibers** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (primal, transmutation) A piece of clothing animates and attacks its wearer at Bolan's command. Bolan targets a creature within 60 feet wearing clothing made from plants, such as cotton, hemp, or grass. The clothing chokes its wearer, restricts their movement, and abrades their skin. The target takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage (DC 18 basic Fortitude save). A creature that takes damage in this way is also [[Flat-Footed]] and takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to Speed until the beginning of Bolan's next turn.</span>
