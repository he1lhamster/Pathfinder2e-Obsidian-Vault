<span class="in-box-ability">**False Faith** Abridan is an ex-cleric. While he's lost the magical abilities that come from his connection to [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]], he can still use the _major staff of healing_ or any of his scrolls by tricking the item. Since he can't cast spells, he can't recharge his staff, and uses its remaining charges only as a last resort.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Marked by Urgathoa <span class="action-icon">4</span> ** (divine, evil, necromancy) **Trigger** Abridan dies before he's had a chance to atone for his blasphemies or has become an actual cleric of [[DATABASE/deity/Urgathoa|Urgathoa]]; **Effect** Urgathoa watched Abridan's fall from grace, and if he dies before he finishes his conversion, her disappointment causes his body to decay as if he had been dead for a week. This process also causes all living creatures within 30 feet to take 11d6 negative damage (DC 33 basic Fortitude save). If steps are not thereafter taken to prevent his soul from returning (such as by casting [[DATABASE/spell/Gentle Repose|gentle repose]] on the partially decayed corpse), Abridan rises as a [[DATABASE/monster/Dybbuk|dybbuk]] on the site of his death a minute after the next sundown and seeks revenge on the PCs for killing him.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Trick Item** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (manipulate) Abridan attempts to trick his staff or a scroll by attempting a [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] check against the item's Trick DC listed above. 
**Success** For the rest of his turn, Abridan can spend actions to activate the staff or scroll as if he could normally use it. 
**Failure** Abridan can't use the item or try to trick it again this turn, but can try again on subsequent turns. 
**Critical Failure** Abridan can't use the item, and can't try to trick it again until his next daily preparation at sunrise.</span>
