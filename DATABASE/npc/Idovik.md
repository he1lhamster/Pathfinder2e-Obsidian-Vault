# Idovik

Ashen Swale's past is shrouded in mystery. He was born among his Sutaki brethren, but violent voices no one else could hear drew him to the wilds of Lost Mammoth Valley. In these wilds, he discovered his spirit guide Idovik and the art of necromancy. He returned to Lyuba a changed man. With Idovik at his side, he established new customs and foul rituals that further cemented the white dragon Venexus's reign over his people.

Idovik Strides twice and then makes a tusk Strike. As long as he moved at least 20 feet, he gains a +2 circumstance bonus to his attack roll. A Medium or smaller creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or be knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] by the force of the blow.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spirit Link** Even if his link is unusual, Idovik is bound to his summoner; he must remain within 100 feet of Ashen Swale at all times. If he ever moves outside this range or is reduced to 0 Hit Points, Idovik's physical form dissolves. Because his link functions unusually and he does not share Hit Points with Ashen Swale, Idovik remains manifested when Ashen Swale is unconscious or dead, as long as he stays near Ashen Swale's body. If Ashen Swale dies, Idovik's form fades away over the next minute. When unmanifested, Idovik must be manifested before he can reappear.</span>
