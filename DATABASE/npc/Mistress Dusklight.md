# Mistress Dusklight

The cruel circus master of the Celestial Menagerie, Mistress Dusklight is a skillful entertainer who delights in controlling and abusing her performers.
 Mistress Dusklight is a self-styled artiste, a veteran entertainer who embodies the worst aspects of the circus industry. Though her original name is forgotten, even to herself, the catfolk who would take the name Dusklight grew up in an Andoran fishing village, but her dreams of stardom led her to run away with a traveling circus. Her natural beauty and grace lent themselves well to circus life, and “Mistress Dusklight” quickly became a star performer.
 As the years passed, Dusklight curated a laundry list of grievances against the circus master: his circuit was monotonous, his exhibits bland, and his acts much too mundane. Dusklight voiced her concerns to no avail, and soon a dark idea blossomed in her mind. She convinced her fellow performers that their circus master was holding them back from renown and riches. When the circus master died suddenly, a victim of Dusklight's secret poisoning, her supporters encouraged her to take over his position.
 Her first act as circus master was to establish a new identity, renaming her troupe the Celestial Menagerie and presenting it as a display of rare and fanciful marvels. She abandoned the circus's usual haunts and set her sights on Absalom, but her ambitions were nearly crushed when she relocated the Menagerie. Her ragtag band of performers simply couldn't compete with the city's established entertainers.
 Upon retreating to the hinterlands of the Isle of Kortos, Dusklight courted unusual performers— individuals with unique physical traits, humanoids of uncommon heritage, and sapient magical creatures. She displayed these creatures as oddities and freaks, reveling in the acclaim and coin that came from exhibiting the unusual. When she couldn't beguile or seduce her targets into willingly joining the Celestial Menagerie, she turned to blackmail, coercive magic, and even forceful abduction. Over time, she grew to enjoy exerting control over others, and any shred of decency she once had vanished beneath the entertainer's mask.
 By the time the Celestial Menagerie arrived in Escadar, Dusklight's reputation as a top-notch ringmaster preceded her. Still, she wasn't content with her lucrative shows and adoring fans. She sought more dangerous prizes, binding azatas, demons, and dragons to her will and exulting in her fantasy of absolute control over these powerful beings. Her increasingly cruel and domineering ways caused a mass desertion recently; several performers and workers fled the Celestial Menagerie to start their own circus far from Escadar. These defectors formed the core of what would become the Circus of Wayward Wonders.
 In seeking new help, Mistress Dusklight came to know of the interdicted Moonstone Hall. She dreamed of the holy treasures this temple might hold—treasures she could use to enhance the Celestial Menagerie even further. She quickly learned that xulgaths from the Darklands had crept into Moonstone Hall, but their presence didn't bother her; she negotiated free passage with a combination of cunning flattery and promises of human sacrifices.
 Mistress Dusklight rarely dirties her own hands, preferring to manipulate her cronies in her drive to control the greatest circus in the Inner Sea region.

## Campaign Role

Mistress Dusklight acts as the ultimate villain of this adventure. As rumors of the Circus of Wayward Wonders reach her ears, Dusklight schemes to thwart her rival performers before they can gain a foothold in her territory. She initially relies on her agents, but she eventually learns that the heroes are closing in on her and, worse, they have the backing of the city guard. Though confronting Dusklight is the climax of this adventure, she first throws all of her minions and performers at the heroes to stop them. The one thing she's unwilling to do is flee; she'd rather risk death than leave the Celestial Menagerie to her rivals.
 The heroes might try to capture Mistress Dusklight rather than kill her, to bring her in chains to Chief Constable Andera Paldreen. If they do, Mistress Dusklight is an uncooperative and sullen prisoner, spitting curses and promises of revenge.
