<span class="in-box-ability">**Call a Battle Echo** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (conjuration) **Effect** Jin-Hae pulls one of the _battle echoes_ (page 19) to her hand. She is fully aware of every _echo_ and can always pull the one she wants, but she cannot call an _echo_ that has already been unsealed.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Link Swords** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (flourish, stance) **Requirements** Jin-Hae is wielding two hook swords; **Effect** Jin-Hae either links her swords together or unlinks them. If the swords are linked, she can make linked hook sword Strikes; if the swords are unlinked, she can make hook sword Strikes.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wind-Fire Charge** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine) **Requirements** Jin-Hae is wielding her wind and fire wheels; **Effect** Jin-Hae blasts off on her wind and fire wheels, leaving an elemental trail in her wake. She Strides up to twice her Speed and makes a wind and fire wheel Strike at any point during her movement. The path left by her movement is filled with her choice of an 8th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Wind|wall of wind]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Wall of Fire|wall of fire]] spell. Jin-Hae is unaffected by any walls she creates with this ability. She cannot use Wind-Fire Charge again for 1d4 rounds. If she uses Wind-Fire Charge again, the wall created by her previous Wind-Fire Charge disappears as soon as her action is completed.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Wind-Fire Chariot** (divine) **Requirements** Jin-Hae is wielding two wind and fire wheels; **Effect** Jin-Hae's wind and fire wheels float by her feet, giving her the benefits of 7th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Air Walk|air walk]]. While this lasts, she can wield her wind and fire wheels even while her hands are full by kicking with them, and her wind and fire wheels gain the thrown 20 feet trait as well as the effects of a [[DATABASE/equipment/Returning|returning]] rune.</span>
