# Hannis Drelev

Hannis Drelev spent his youth in Brevoy frustrated at the lack of opportunity for advancement. When he heard Lady Jamandi was looking for volunteers to aid her in exploring and taming the Stolen Lands, he saw an opportunity to bolster his fame. In the months since, Hannis has come to regret his decision, and now that he has been forced to surrender to [[Castruccio Irovetti]] and [[Armag Twice-Born]], his attitude has shifted from frustration to outright cruelty. Drelev comes across as a sullen, greedy, conceited man, never satisfied with his lot in life, but always disdainful of anyone who has less than him. Though skilled at politics, the baron fancies himself a skilled swordsman as well. He loves dueling and often spars against his own guardsmen and senior officers. He likes to show off, taunting and belittling those he overpowers, but reacts angrily to situations where others get the best of him.
 A patient opponent who prides himself on his ability to skillfully outmaneuver his foes, Baron Drelev begins nearly every turn with Defensive Slice. He favors disarming foes, and attempts to do so once per round when facing an armed foe, mocking them wickedly if he's successful and cursing them violently if not.
