# Surgeon

The surgeon specializes in the physical alteration of the body to prevent the spread of disease, removing necrotic and decaying flesh to help the whole to survive. Few healers know the science of anatomy and physiology better than the surgeon. While their expertise is of grave importance in the medical world, the downside is that when one is in need of their talents, it is likely the complaint is serious. In medical matters, a surgeon is a 6th-level challenge.

On a success, the surgeon's melee Strikes deal an extra 1d6 precision damage against that creature (2d6 on a critical success) until 1 minute passes or the surgeon critically hits that creature, whichever comes first. Using this action again designates a new target and ends the effect for any previous target. A surgeon can target an individual creature no more than once per day with this ability.</span>
