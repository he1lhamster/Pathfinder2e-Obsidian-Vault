# Palace Guard

Every palace has its gatekeepers. Often the younger offspring of minor nobility or those from long lines of trusted staff, the palace guards are in charge of defending the royal family and their inner stronghold. Their days consist of guarding doorways, escorting nobles to various locations, and keeping those in their charge as safe as possible. The statistics below are for the lowest rank-and-file member of a small nation's palace guards; they also work well for elite guards of a lesser noble.
