# Pathfinder Field Agent

_This half-elf woman looks dressed to travel anywhere and prepared for any eventuality she might find along the way._
 No two field agents follow the same path to join the Pathfinder Society, nor the same path once they embark on their first expedition. The Society's treacherous missions require all types of adventurers, from seasoned combatants to ruin delvers and experts in the occult. Some field agents are highly specialized, filling a single role in a larger group of Pathfinders, while others branch out into a broad range of abilities.
 This field agent seeks the thrill of discovering lost treasures from the Inner Sea's many ancient ruins. She scouts ahead for her team, keeping an eye out for enemies, traps, and other dangers. In fights, she is cautious and practical, preferring to stay mobile and out of sight. She sneaks in for a finishing blow when victory is certain.

### Siora Qinndove

An heir to two wealthy families, Siora grew up used to getting her own way. But Siora wound up becoming interested in archeology and the act of investigating every nook and cranny of an unknown artifact. Seeing that lost cities were hard to find and often contained things money couldn't buy, Siora joined the Pathfinder Society, loaded down with every piece of expensive gear that could prove useful.
