# Azarketi Tide Tamer

The most ambitious and capable azarketis become tide tamers, learning how to speak with aquatic animals and even train the strongest of these creatures to help defend their territory. Tide tamers act as guardians for their communities, scouts at sea and on the shore, or even entertainers for land-bound people's amusement. They're generally found with one or more aquatic allies whom they've befriended. Several serve alongside Absalom's Wave Riders as scouts, animal interlocutors, and guides.
