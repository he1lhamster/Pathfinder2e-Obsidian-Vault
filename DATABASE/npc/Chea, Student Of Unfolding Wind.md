description: '<i>This handsome gnome sports an impressive coiffure and a flashy costume
  that catches the eye.</i><br/><br/>While most Firebrands enjoy the attention their
  exploits bring, the charming scoundrel takes this to extremes, often boasting about
  their daring exploits and attempting to parlay stories of their notorious deeds
  into free drinks or lodging. The scoundrel sees little harm in taking credit for
  any activities attributed to the organization, provided that intervention from local
  law enforcement seems unlikely. They are likely to take on high-profile jobs for
  the Firebrands just for the thrill of later recounting the narrow scrapes of their
  adventure.<br/><br/> The charming scoundrel is as dramatic in combat as outside
  of it, often darting from opponent to opponent and disorienting foes with flashy
  swordplay. If a battle is going well, the scoundrel will often shout taunts at slow-footed
  opponents or encouragement to allies. While prideful and competitive, the scoundrel
  is a pragmatist at heart and will opt to add a tale of a cunning escape to their
  repertoire if the odds seem stacked against them.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge

# Chea, Student Of Unfolding Wind

Born to a large family of werecrocodiles in the nation of Jalmeray, Chea was envied by her fellows for her strange lack of the werecreature's curse. Chea's mother assured the girl that her blessing proved she was meant for great things, though her bitter cousins mocked her for her soft heart and lack of killer instinct. One night when she was a teenager, she went out for a swim, sick of the insults and teasing from her peers. The beastkin accidentally stumbled across an adventurer, who was stargazing by the riverside. The strange woman didn't attack, however, instead introducing herself as Nisha and inviting Chea to come look at the stars. Nisha pointed out a glowing comet in the sky and told Chea that the star was actually an elemental lord named [[DATABASE/deity/Ranginori|Ranginori]], and that Nisha's fellow adventurers, the Pathfinders, were working to set Ranginori free. When Nisha left that evening, she gave her telescope to Chea. From then on, Chea spent her nights gazing up to the glowing star, whispering secret prayers in hope they might comfort the trapped god. 
 Chea saw the moment her bright star burst across the sky, freeing Ranginori from his uncounted years of imprisonment. Knowing the hard journey that Ranginori faced ahead of him, Chea was among one of the first to pledge her faith to the elemental lord. Encouraged by her mother, Chea approached the Monastery of Unfolding Wind in Jalmeray. Though she had to hide her true nature from her fellow acolytes, her determination saw her excel in her monk training. Yet when she returned to visit her family after her initial studies were complete, she found them decimated and scattered. The survivors gave confused, conflicted reports, but several of them claimed that Pathfinders had attacked them. 
 Though Chea knew her family weren't always saints, she found she couldn't let this go. The monk now searches for answers to what truly happened, and vengeance for those who killed her kin.

## Plot Hooks

Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Chea into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.

* Chea seeks out the heroes in hopes of learning a new fighting technique to give her a further edge in combat. She's willing to share an aspect of her training in return.
* As the heroes leave a dungeon, some ruins, or another adventuring site, Chea makes her presence known. She challenges the heroes to a fight, believing them to be Pathfinders.
* A whisper on the wind guides the heroes to Chea. The monk notes that she's received a message from her god about the whereabouts of a gem that holds another elemental lord. Chea believes it is her fate, and the heroes', to rescue the trapped god.
