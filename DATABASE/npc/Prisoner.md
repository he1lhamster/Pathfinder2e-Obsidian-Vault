# Prisoner

Most who end up in a jail, dungeon, or prison are just biding their time until their imprisonment ends, trying to find ways to make it through interminable days of boredom and deprivation. Some, however, may use their time on the inside to strengthen their criminal connections. Using force and intimidation to gain status among other prisoners, they create makeshift weapons to take down their enemies and give them an edge if escape becomes possible. Even for prisoners who don't become involved in the world of prison politics, learning to stand up for themselves and projecting an air of toughness can become essential for survival in a place where people have little left to lose.
