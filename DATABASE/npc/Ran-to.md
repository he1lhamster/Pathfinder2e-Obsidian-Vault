He makes a [[Leap]], [[High Jump]], or [[Long Jump]]. His maximum distance is 40 feet. He must succeed at an [[Athletics]] check to perform the leap as usual, but regardless of the type of leap, the DC is equal to the number of feet he moves in the air. Ran-to can attempt an Athletics check to [[Grapple]] at any point during the jump. Immediately after the attempt, he (and the creature, if the Grapple was successful) falls to the ground. Neither creature takes damage from this fall.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Titan Wrestler** Ran-to can attempt to [[Disarm]], [[Grapple]], [[Shove]], or [[Trip]] creatures up to two sizes larger than him.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Whirlwind Toss** <span class="action-icon">3</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Requirements** Ran-to has a creature [[Grabbed]]; **Effect** Ran-to spins the creature he's holding, smashing them against any creatures within his reach, and then throws the creature aside. Ran-to attempts an [[Athletics]] check against the grabbed creature's Fortitude DC. **Critical Success** Ran-to tosses his foe a great distance. The grapple ends. The grabbed creature is thrown into a space within 10 feet, takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage, and falls [[Prone]]. All creatures adjacent to Ran-to take the same amount of bludgeoning damage (DC 34 basic Reflex save). **Success** As critical success, except the grabbed creatures is thrown into a space within 5 feet, and creatures take 6d6 bludgeoning damage. **Failure** Ran-to tosses his foe aside. The grapple ends. The grabbed creature falls [[Prone]]. **Critical Failure** Ran-to loses hold of his foe and the grapple ends.</span>
