# Foras

The man who would take the name Foras grew up millennia ago among worshipers of [[Pharasma]], yet he came to believe that the Outer Gods were the keys to claiming personal power. He tricked his people's priests into to imparting eldritch truths they would not normally share, then shared them with a few fellow secretive scholars of the occult.
 Gathering those whom Foras could manipulate, he retreated to a new stronghold—a location now known as Candlemere. Here, Foras's cult gave up their sight and their souls, only to become trapped with him within their own compound when their leader's brother tracked them down and imprisoned them. Yet even this hasn't stymied Foras, and he continues to this day to work toward his goal of drawing [[Yog-Sothoth]] into the world.

**Unseen Sight** This is a precise sense that mimics [[Darkvision]] yet functions even if the eye sockets themselves are covered. More importantly, the unseen sight allows a Thresholder to see the truth of the world, granting them the ability to see things as they actually are as if they were under the effects of [[True Seeing]], provided they are located within a region under the influence of YogSothoth. Currently in the Stolen Lands, this is limited to the island of Candlemere and the dungeons within it; beyond this area, the Thresholder cultists are [[Blinded]].
