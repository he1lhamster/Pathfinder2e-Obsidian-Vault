# Veteran Reclaimer

_This grizzled half-orc wields a longbow with the familiarity of a woman who considers it more as an extension of her body than a weapon._
 When Lastwall fell, many of the former Knights of Ozem became disheartened and scattered, wandering aimlessly through the wilds of the Inner Sea. Though the horrific events that led to the fall of Lastwall shook their faith in the traditional hierarchy of the Knights, they hardened their resolve to hunt all undead from the face of Golarion. These Crimson Reclaimers still see the Whispering Tyrant as their primary foe, but they can be found in many of the most haunted regions of the world, living off the land and hunting the restless dead.
 While heroism and fervor for their cause still burns in their heart, veteran reclaimers have lived long enough to lose their taste for tales of courtly valor and valiant last stands. They have learned the value of caution and thus engage their enemies from range and use terrain to their advantage. They are quick to strike back at enemies that harm their allies, knowing staunch teammates are essential in the face of the world's many horrors.

### Ruthal Ironroar

The constant battles between Belkzen and Lastwall resulted in prejudice on both sides, and Ruthal never found her life in either land pleasant. For many years, Ruthal lived alone in the wilderness, avoiding other people. Yet when Lastwall began to crumble, the half-orc found she couldn't turn her head the other way. Though her moods are capricious and her social skills out of practice, Ruthal is a true angel to those that she rescues.
