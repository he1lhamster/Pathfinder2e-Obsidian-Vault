**Spatial Sense** Syndara instinctively knows the position of all creatures and objects within the _Glass Lighthouse_ as a precise sense. His senses do not extend into extraplanar spaces (such as a [[DATABASE/equipment/Bag of Holding|bag of holding]]), even if the entrance to these spaces is within the _Lighthouse_.

As the triggering creature moves, space reasserts itself, teleporting Syndara to be in the same position relative to the creature as he was when the creature began its movement. If the space he would teleport into is occupied, he displaces the obstructing creature or object into the nearest available space.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Extradimensional Immunity**; Syndara can foil any attempts to use planar powers against him. He is immune to all extradimensional effects, such as [[DATABASE/spell/Maze|maze]], but can choose to be affected by such effects normally. </span><span class="in-box-ability">**Keeper of the Lighthouse**; Syndara can choose whether he is affected by his worldspheres (page 57).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Portal Redirection <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (conjuration, divine, teleportation) **Trigger** Syndara is targeted by a ranged Strike or spell attack roll; **Effect** Syndara opens a portal in front of the incoming missile, then opens another portal nearby that fires the missile at another creature within 60 feet of him. He takes no damage from the triggering attack and makes a ranged Strike with a +43 attack bonus. The Strike deals damage according to the triggering ability.</span>

Any creature struck must succeed at a DC 46 Will save or be teleported to a location of Syndara's choice within 60 feet of him when the flurry is complete. The teleportation has the conjuration, divine, and teleportation traits.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Dimensional Grasp** (abjuration, divine) Syndara's grasp extends across dimensions. Creatures grabbed by Syndara can't benefit from teleportation, extradimensional effects, or effects that would move them to a different plane.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Mover of Worlds** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (conjuration, divine) With great regret, Syndara calls his masterpieces from the firmament to crash down upon his enemies. He flings four worldspheres to any four points within 500 feet. Each worldsphere deals 20d6 damage in a 40-foot burst (DC 48 basic Reflex save). Syndara chooses the type of damage for each worldsphere, which can be any type he chooses, though each worldsphere must deal a different type of damage. On a failed save, the target is pushed to the edge of the burst. No matter how many overlapping explosions it's caught in, a creature can take damage from only one worldsphere per round. Syndara is immune to the damage dealt by his worldspheres. Syndara can't use Mover of Worlds again for 1d4 rounds.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**[[DATABASE/monsterability/Rend|Rend]]** <span class="action-icon">1</span> spatial pincers</span>
