# Mialari Docur

_The epitome of elven grace and mistress of a school that secretly teaches young spies, Lady Docur is a Kintargan patriot to the core._
 Mialari remembers her father signing on as a bodyguard for House Drovenge, and she remembers arriving in Kintargo in 4455 AR as the Drovenges attempted to establish a branch of the family there. Having already lost her mother, the young girl was unprepared for the news, soon after, that her father had been killed—the enemies of House Drovenge were not to be outwitted so easily. Lady Eleria Drovenge responded to the girl's grief with deep empathy, and she and Lord Placus Drovenge adopted Mialari into their sprawling family. As a scion of House Drovenge, Mialari received the broad education of a Chelaxian aristocrat; in addition, Lady Eleria worked hard to connect Mialari to her elven culture, hiring tutors to teach her the language, history, and manners of Kyonin. Although Mialari was an eager student, she was much more drawn to Chelaxian art and theater than to her ancestral culture. She made friends easily and spent countless hours with them at operas, banquets, hunts, and other diversions. She rarely even thought of herself as an elf, so little did it matter.
 Thus, when Mialari fell in love with Maris Docur, the youngest son of a Kintargan noble house, there was no obstacle to their marrying. Their relationship bloomed, and their townhouse became the meeting place for new artists, singers, and composers. But in time, age claimed Maris's life, and Mialari was devastated. She fully realized, for the first time, how her natural longevity was a curse.
 For several years, Mialari isolated herself, refusing to join her relatives when House Drovenge retreated to Westcrown. As House Docur dissolved, she found herself inheriting aging buildings and properties. She decided to start a school, as a tribute to her adoptive parents and, hopefully, as a way to create meaning and purpose for herself. Selling everything except an old building in the Villegre District, she transformed the edifice into a boarding school. Mialari styled the curriculum around elven culture and adopted Kyonin fashion and manners for herself, then reached out to her network. When Lady Docur's School for Girls opened in 4510 AR, her first 20 students came from the foremost aristocratic houses across Cheliax. Mialari found the tasks of developing her students' talents and worldview rewarding, but she avoided forming close relationships.
 As the years wore on, changes in the political landscape made Mialari's school less appealing to aristocrats. Mialari began reaching out to more marginalized half-elf girls, offering scholarships and expanding her reach to Isger and Molthune. She found that half-elves needed a more a practical education, and she shifted her curriculum accordingly. When House Thrune won the Chelish Civil War, Lady Docur's School proved a target for both their revisionist historians and agents of the church of [[DATABASE/deity/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]].

Her goals were to develop a network capable of evading and keeping one step ahead of the new regime, to preserve some of the Kintargo she had known, and to prepare for whatever political upheavals might follow.
 When the rebellion for Ravounel's freedom began, decades later, Mialari was more inclined and better prepared to act, and the arrival of Barzillai Thrune galvanized her will. Mialari allied with the new Silver Ravens, directing the Lacunafex to share information and perform other covert actions to aid the rebels, while always giving the Silver Ravens the credit. In part, Mialari wanted to ensure that the rebels didn't also resurrect the Gray Spiders, Kintargo's former thieves' guild, as she didn't want any competition recruiting Kintargo's most talented young thieves and spies. Mostly, however, she wanted freedom for Kintargo. As open fighting broke out, she was key in forming the Silver Council, which served to coordinate the rebellion. While no longer officially on the council, she remains quietly influential behind the scenes.

## Campaign Use

Mialari's dedication to freedom and self-determination makes her a natural enemy of the Scarlet Triad. Thus she is already inclined to help the PCs, and provided they don't offend her, she becomes a strong ally. If the PCs are injured, she can aid them or provide room to rest and heal in the safety of her school. If necessary, she interfaces with the Silver Council on the PCs' behalf. At the GM's discretion, any of the PCs with the discretion and stealth she values might be invited to join the Lacunafex as members, or even as adjunct professors— while the overwhelming majority of Lacunafex members are female, there is no gender requirement.
