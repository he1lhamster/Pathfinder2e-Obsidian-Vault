description: 'The bard Grigori is a charismatic orator and an agent of Pitax who seeks
  to undermine the PCs'' authority while spying on their kingdom. He shows up in the
  kingdom''s capital city while the PCs are out adventuring and immediately begins
  giving speeches criticizing and denigrating their leadership and actions. More and
  more of the townsfolk gather to hear him talk and, as the days wear on, he builds
  a wellspring of support among the disaffected settlers in the town. Every decision
  the PCs make has a winner and a loser, and Grigori is gifted at shifting focus to
  the losers in these decisions and riling them up. Whether it is appealing to the
  citizens who didn''t get what they wanted when the PCs built a new city block, to
  spinning a narrative that paints a recent event in the most horrid light for those
  for whom the outcome was a negative, a properly played Grigori should become a constant
  barb in the players'' side and one of the most memorable villains they encounter.
  Grigori takes great pains to avoid breaking any of the PCs'' laws so that they have
  no legal justification to arrest him other than that they want to silence him.<br/><br/>
  Grigori is more than just an itinerant storyteller; he''s a spy and agent provocateur
  sent by [[DATABASE/npc/Castruccio Irovetti|King Irovetti]] , the Lord of Pitax,
  to spread chaos and dissent in the town with the aim of overthrowing the PCs and
  possibly paving the way for Pitax to annex the settlement. In order to cover his
  tracks and retain plausible deniability, Irovetti used several layers of agents
  to hire Grigori; as far as the bard knows, he was hired to cause trouble in this
  fledgling town by agents from Fort Drelev to the west.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge

# Gristleburst, Inquisitive Pyromaniac

Gristleburst grew up among the Gullcracker goblins outside of Otari, but he was always a loner. His irrepressible curiosity and keen mind for chemistry earned him few friends among the goblins, even though his firebombs were always a source of good fun. When the Gullcrackers were killed and reanimated as [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Zombie|zombies]], Gristleburst took on the lonely, sad task of putting down each one of his former kin. He now wanders the world as an alchemist-for-hire, just as eager to investigate unusual mysteries as he is to set things ablaze.
Gristleburst is an unreliable ally. He's quick to make friends—particularly because he's otherwise all alone in the world—but he frequently pursues his own ideals without consulting his allies and hurls his bombs with reckless glee.

## Plot Hooks

Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Gristleburst into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.

* When the heroes are following a treasure map through a dangerous wilderness, Gristleburst agrees to show them a safe path in exchange for a share of the loot.
* The heroes are hunting an arsonist, and Gristleburst can help identify blast patterns and accelerants the arsonist used to set the blaze.
* Gristleburst's reckless alchemy inadvertently sets a stand of trees or a building on fire, and he needs urgent help to put the fire out before it spreads.

Creatures in that area have the [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] condition, and other creatures are concealed to them. This smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.</span>
