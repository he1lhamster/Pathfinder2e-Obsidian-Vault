He makes a [[Leap]], [[High Jump]], or [[Long Jump]]. His maximum distance is 100 feet. He must succeed at an [[Athletics]] check to perform the leap as usual, but regardless of the type of leap the DC is equal to half the number of feet he moves in the air. Ran-to can attempt an Athletics check to [[Grapple]] at any point during the jump. Immediately after the attempt, he (and the creature, if the Grapple was successful) falls to the ground. Ran-to takes no falling damage when using this ability, but the grabbed creature takes the appropriate amount of falling damage as if it had fallen the distance moved. Ran-to can spend three actions to use this ability instead of two; if he does, he can use Plummeting Fall to add 12d6 bludgeoning damage to the falling damage dealt to the grabbed creature, and the creature is knocked [[Prone]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Plummeting Fall** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (certain kill) **Frequency** once per round; **Requirements** Ran-to has a creature [[Grabbed]] and the creature is airborne; **Effect** Ran-to spins and increases the force of gravity, sending him and the creature to the ground.

Ran-to attempts an [[Athletics]] check against the grabbed creature's Fortitude DC. Regardless of the result, the creature is no longer grabbed after this activity. 
**Critical Success** Ran-to tosses his foe mightily. The grabbed creature is thrown into a space within 20 feet, takes 16d6 bludgeoning damage, and falls [[Prone]]. All creatures adjacent to Ran-to take the same amount of bludgeoning damage (DC 43 basic Reflex save). 
**Success** As critical success, except the grabbed creature is thrown into a space within 10 feet, and creatures take 12d6 bludgeoning damage. 
**Failure** Ran-to tosses his foe aside. The grabbed creature falls prone. 
**Critical Failure** Ran-to loses hold of his foe.</span>
