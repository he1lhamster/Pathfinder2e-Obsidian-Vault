# Executioner

Executioners carry out sentences from cruel tyrants and legitimate rulers alike. Most remain numb to the necessity of their duty, but some evil executioners grow to love the power of having someone else's life in their hands.

On a hit, in addition to taking damage, the target must attempt a Fortitude save or be reduced to 0 HP and become dying 1. If the creature was already dying (including if it was reduced to 0 HP by the Strike's damage), the creature's dying value increases by 1, in addition to any increase from the Strike. On a critical failure, the creature dies instantly. If the executioner's Strike was a critical hit, the target uses the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of their saving throw.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Intimidating Strike** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (emotion, fear, fighter, mental) The executioner makes a melee Strike. If it hits and deals damage, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]], or frightened 2 on a critical hit.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Mark for Death** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate) The executioner marks a single creature they can see for death. The first time each round the executioner Strikes that creature, the Strike deals 1d12 additional precision damage. The creature remains marked for death until the executioner is knocked out, marks a different creature for death, or the encounter ends.</span>
