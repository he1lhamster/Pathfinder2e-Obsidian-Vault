She then immediately [[Sneak]], but must end her movement in a space that's not adjacent to any enemies. All creatures other than Hezle in the smoke cloud must attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save.

She still must expend charges from the staff normally; when she prepares the staff each morning, she is capable of placing 4 charges in the staff.</span>
