# Morlibint, Small-Town Bookseller

Odd Stories is one of Otari's most distinctive shops: a three-story stone tower looming over a one-story wooden bookstore. The shop is the home and business of the wizard Morlibint, a scholar who enjoys talking about magical theory only slightly less than thrilling fiction. Imagination, he insists, is the most wondrous magic of all. Morlibint is a middle-aged man with short, red hair and a perpetual scowl that quickly transforms into a smile when he identifies a fellow bibliophile.
Odd Stories is an excellent place for anyone seeking gripping novels, clever anthologies, or useful textbooks, and Morlibint is a valuable contact for any party. He's happy to exchange spells with another wizard, sell arcane scrolls to adventurers, or buy rare tomes that heroes come across in their travels. He never accompanies adventurers on their quests, however, instead finding excitement in treasured books from the safety of his favorite fireside armchair.

## Plot Hooks

Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating the bookseller Morlibint into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.

* Morlibint's rarest almanac has been stolen and he hires the heroes to discover who took it and why.
* The heroes consult Morlibint to learn more about a creature's peculiar ability or resistance. Morlibint searches through fictional accounts of the creature to find the answer, which might not be entirely accurate.
* Morlibint has learned the location of a particularly valuable tome and offers the heroes both the opportunity to retrieve it (he only wants to copy a few pages from it) and hints about the curse the tome reputedly imparts on those who carry it.
