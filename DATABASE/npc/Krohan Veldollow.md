# Krohan Veldollow

Krohan's mistakes kicked off several important campaign developments, such as Zogototaru's rampage and the machinations of a hryngar villain the PCs haven't met yet. Krohan provides a strong hook for the PCs to recover and repair Taargick's clan dagger, all while providing greater context for the legends of High King Taargick and Clan Tolorr. During this adventure, Krohan's gradual discovery of his occult abilities also helps illustrate Rivethun lore, giving the players a window into this iconic dwarven tradition. Importantly, Krohan doesn't seek the spotlight. His own attempt at heroics inflicted real harm, and he would much rather resolve past misdeeds and support the PCs' adventuring careers.
 Krohan's journey parallels many of the campaign's themes: acknowledging past wrongs and working to repair the damage. In helping him, the players can better internalize these objectives for when they depart Highhelm and have opportunities to start mending misdeeds of the past.
