# Krohan Veldollow

Krohan's mistakes kicked off several important campaign developments, such as Zogototaru's rampage and the machinations of a hryngar villain the PCs haven't met yet. Krohan provides a strong hook for the PCs to recover and repair Taargick's clan dagger, all while providing greater context for the legends of High King Taargick and Clan Tolorr. During this adventure, Krohan's gradual discovery of his occult abilities also helps illustrate Rivethun lore, giving the players a window into this iconic dwarven tradition. Importantly, Krohan doesn't seek the spotlight. His own attempt at heroics inflicted real harm, and he would much rather resolve past misdeeds and support the PCs' adventuring careers.
 Krohan's journey parallels many of the campaign's themes: acknowledging past wrongs and working to repair the damage. In helping him, the players can better internalize these objectives for when they depart Highhelm and have opportunities to start mending misdeeds of the past.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Occult Catharsis** (emotion, healing, occult) Krohan's magic converts his pain into spellpower. After he casts an innate occult spell, he attempts a DC 5 flat check, increasing the DC by twice the spell's level if it was not a cantrip. On a success, Krohan's Spirits Drawn to Suffering effect ends, he can reduce the value of one condition affecting him by 1, and he regains 2d6 Hit Points.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Unwitting Rivethun** (emotion, occult) Krohan has very limited access to Rivethun magic, able to cast spells only when experiencing pain or distress.</span><span class="in-box-ability">****Spirits Drawn to Suffering** <span class="action-icon">4</span> ** (occult) **Frequency** once per 10 minutes **Trigger** Krohan critically fails a saving throw, takes mental damage, takes damage from a critical hit, orgains a harmful condition with a numerical value (such as frightened or sickened). This effect does not trigger due to self-harm or similarly engineered circumstances. **Effect** Krohan gains the ability to cast his innate occult spells for 1 minute.</span>
