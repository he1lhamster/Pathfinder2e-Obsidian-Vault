description: "Born in 7195 IC (4695 AR) to the noble Nai family of Goka, Yan Fei's\
  \ comfortable childhood years were cut short when her parents fell to the blade\
  \ of assassins during a diplomatic mission, leaving Yan Fei in the care of her grandfather,\
  \ Nai Hu Buo, then the emperor of Goka.<br/><br/> For the next 10 years, Hu Buo\
  \ focused his time and efforts on Yan Fei's care. He trained her in the ins and\
  \ outs of courtly life, shaping her into a suitable heir to the Nai legacy. Fearing\
  \ future attempts on Yan Fei's life, Hu Buo also made sure Yan Fei could hold her\
  \ own, and he tasked the [[DATABASE/archetype/Butterfly Blade|Butterfly Blades]]\
  \ \u2014 an elite group of warriors that served the Nai family as bodyguards\u2014\
  to train Yan Fei in martial arts and self-defense. The Butterfly Blades' storied\
  \ history with the Nai family and Goka made them experts in espionage and intimidation,\
  \ skills that Yan Fei learned and mastered alongside her grandfather's political\
  \ expertise.<br/><br/> By the age of 12, Yan Fei was fully trained in the arts of\
  \ both combat and public affairs. Satisfied with his granddaughter's skill, Hu Buo\
  \ returned to the world of Gokan politics, receiving an exuberant welcome from the\
  \ people of Goka. Shortly thereafter, Hu Buo earned an unprecedented third term\
  \ as emperor of Goka. Meanwhile, Yan Fei continued her training with the Butterfly\
  \ Blades.<br/><br/> Shortly after turning 14, Yan Fei vowed to find her family's\
  \ killers. She spent several months in Goka proper, adopting multiple personas to\
  \ dig up details from the city's unscrupulous information brokers. Her skills did\
  \ ultimately lead her to her parents' assassins, whom she struck down with little\
  \ effort, but she remained unsatisfied. Her continued efforts led her to the Yun-Ta\
  \ clan, the Gokan noble family that contracted her parents' assassination. She needn't\
  \ have bothered to seek out the Yun-Ta, for the family had made dozens of enemies\
  \ since the Fei assassination and long ago sealed their own fate; by the time Yan\
  \ Fei found the connection, the entire family had been dead for several years. Yan\
  \ Fei's journey was over, and she had nothing to show for it. She returned home\
  \ to continue her training as a noble, no longer enchanted by illusions of revenge.<br/><br/>\
  \ Two years into his third term, Hu Buo suddenly grew ill and died, leading Goka's\
  \ parliament to fracture over disagreements of a suitable replacement. Yan Fei then\
  \ stepped in, offering to complete her grandfather's term. The parliament attempted\
  \ to block the suggestion, but Yan Fei called upon an obscure law she had studied\
  \ as a child, which allowed for the inheritance of the position. Their hands tied,\
  \ the parliament agreed and Yan Fei became acting empress in 7210 IC (4710 AR) at\
  \ the age of 15.<br/><br/> Yan Fei proved not only an effective leader, but a beloved\
  \ figurehead who inspired Gokans both rich and poor, high-born and commoner alike.\
  \ Yan Fei's aristocratic upbringing allowed her to slip into the politics with ease,\
  \ and her experience hiding among the people during her time with the Butterfly\
  \ Blades opened her eyes to the many plights of the everyday citizen. She used her\
  \ position to push for change and progress for Goka, earning supporters from all\
  \ corners. Although the next election for Goka's leader is still over a decade away,\
  \ it seems the city's parliament and people are more than willing to accept Yan\
  \ Fei's continued rule and reelect her as empress when the time comes.<br/><br/>Campaign\
  \ Role<br/><br/>The player characters get their first chance to meet the empress\
  \ and make a good impression on the powerful ruler in Chapter 3 of this adventure.\
  \ Nai Yan Fei continues to serve as an important figure in the following adventures\
  \ as a potential guide and information-provider, and the characters' interaction\
  \ with her on Bonmu will determine what kind of relationship they have with the\
  \ empress going forward. If the characters manage to win her over, they'll meet\
  \ the kind aristocrat who's rightly earned the admiration of Goka's common folk.\
  \ On the other hand, if their impression proves less than favorable, the characters\
  \ must instead contend with a calculating politician who deftly navigates the minefields\
  \ of diplomacy and etiquette\u2014a ruthless empress who knows how to make the most\
  \ of a group like the player characters before casting them aside when their worth\
  \ has run its course.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Humanoid</u> ( [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]]\

# Narseigus

Driven by political and magical ambition, this sorcerer has rediscovered a unique spellcasting art used to command [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Cave Worm|cave worms]].
 For all its emphasis on personal toil, [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Duergar|hryngar]] culture rewards ensnaring others in a web of obligation and subservience. The more one's subordinates produce, the greater their master's take, so a hryngar who commands a mighty cave worm would be powerful indeed! At least this is what Narseigus believes.
 His early training to be a miner was interrupted by the emergence of his magical talents. When his arm momentarily and unexpectedly transformed into a tentacle that strangled his mentor, this one murderous act both spared him any education debt to his mentor and set him on a new career path... only for him to become indebted to magical masters who claimed most of his subsequent profits. In his limited spare time, he read avidly, always seeking new inspiration that could advance his career and livelihood.
 This research eventually unearthed worm calling, an obscure hryngar magical tradition that had fallen out of favor—both due the psychological damage involved and the catastrophic consequences that might ensue should a cave worm break free. Knowing of no living worm callers (or at least unable to indebt himself to even more masters), Narseigus began piecing together the techniques from fragmentary sources. Yet the written word had limits. He increasingly realized that mastering this art required studying cave worms, learning their every instinct to attune his mind to theirs. Absconding without closing out his debts, he embarked on a decades-long expedition throughout Nar-Voth to follow cave worms, hone his spells, and swindle supplies as needed.
 And then he felt it: the telltale tremors of a cave worm, but massive beyond any he'd ever witnessed. He eagerly tracked the beast, witnessing its trail of destruction and discovering that this was the legendary [[DATABASE/monster/Crimson Worm|crimson worm]], Zogototaru. The creature's power captivated him. Why should he settle for controlling lesser worms when he could enthrall such a behemoth? Yet even though Zogototaru had left countless tunnels over the millennia, tracing her whereabouts proved challenging. Narseigus at last identified her lair, though getting to that lair would require traversing dwarven territory and excavating countless tons of stone. To his chagrin, he needed help.
 Fortunately, King Orgukagan of Hagegraf needed a miracle. With no great deeds to his name, the king knew his reign was unremarkable and his ongoing rule was equally precarious. Thus, when Narseigus proposed a military venture that would both crush Rolgrimmdur and help Narseigus seize a mighty asset to fuel future victories, the king eagerly bankrolled his operation. The sorcerer received everything he needed for his research, including privileged access to the king's ear. The operation's scope steadily expanded, earning Narseigus a coalition army, growing clout, and an impressive list of enemies who resented his rise to power.
 But for Narseigus, it would all be a means to an end. All that mattered was his magic.

## Campaign Role

For much of the campaign, Narseigus is a sinister mastermind always several steps ahead of the PCs. They gradually learned of him in “Cult of the Cave Worm,” the previous adventure, uncovering his plans to invade Rolgrimmdur, command Zogototaru, and break into the Sky King's Tomb. However, his self-serving objectives have made him many enemies, and the more the PCs uncover, the more of his embittered rivals they meet and might turn against him. Ultimately, he can only rely on his thralls.
 Yet Narseigus is so driven that he rarely glances back to notice the damage the PCs cause. By the time he does notice, it's too late. He's one of the final fights of the campaign, letting the PCs clash with Zogototaru and orchestrate Narseigus's comeuppance in one exciting scene.
 Narratively, Narseigus provides time pressure to what could otherwise be a casual expedition. After all, Taargick's tomb has survived over 9,000 years. What's another few months? But with Narseigus and his schemes, finding the tomb and thwarting the sorcerer become intertwined goals, keeping the PCs on the move.
