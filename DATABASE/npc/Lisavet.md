# Lisavet, Well-Read Acolyte

Lisavet found two callings in the Dawnflower Library. She was not only drawn to the faith of [[Sarenrae]], benevolent goddess of the sun and healing, but also adored the numerous and varied books within the library. Although trained as a healer, she spent most of her time reading adventure stories. When the opportunity came for adventure of her own, Lisavet put her self-doubt aside and embraced her faith, becoming a righteous hero. Lisavet's adventures are described in _The Shroud of Four Silences_.
Lisavet is just the sort of person anyone would want to find at a local shrine or hospital: caring, intelligent, and eager to provide whatever assistance she can. Although she puts on a greater show of confidence than she sometimes feels, she knows that Sarenrae will never let her down.

## Plot Hooks

Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Lisavet into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.

* Lisavet needs some special herbs to make a rare healing poultice she's read about. She knows she's ill-suited to handle an expedition to find the herbs on her own and wants the heroes to accompany her.
* Having suffered a strange wound that resists ordinary attempts to heal it, the heroes must come to a specialist like Lisavet.
* While perusing an ancient folio, Lisavet discovered a map to a forgotten shrine of [[Sarenrae]] in a forlorn section of wilderness. She needs aid to reach it and restore it to its former glory.
