# Zane Ikundi

Zane is the scion of a noble family in the Nine Walls, the homeland of Matanji orcs in the Mwangi expanse. He has natural charm and good looks and fully expects to become an ambassador for his people when he's older. He considers his education at the Magaambya to be a pleasant dalliance, and he spends most his time with the friends he's made there. Zane is an intelligent young man with something of a lazy streak, simply putting in the necessary work to get by.
 When Zane was a toddler, his parents gave him to local priests for a blessing in a local river. Playful water spirits took notice of the baby and stole him from the inattentive priests. Zane's parents believed he'd been drowned and lost. A year and a day after Zane disappeared, he washed back up on the banks of the river and was reunited with his relieved but puzzled family. Since then, Zane has felt the stirring of fey magic within him, but his family insisted on putting the disappearance firmly in the past and moving on. Zane's budding powers frightened his family, so he learned to keep them hidden, something he no longer has to do since his enrollment in the Magaambya.
 Due to his charm, Zane is quick to make friends, but he's found he has the most in common with Ekene. The two both know how it feels to be misunderstood and understand the heavy weight of the expectations placed upon them by their families and communities.
