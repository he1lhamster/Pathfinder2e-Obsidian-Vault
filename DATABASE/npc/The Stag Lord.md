# The Stag Lord

The Stag Lord never had a name, for his father Nugrah only called him “boy,” and then only when the old man demanded some sort of backbreaking chore or was looking for something to beat on. Times remained tough for the boy until the night he had the dream.
 A blindingly beautiful woman approached him, challenging him with a simple question: Why did he defer to his father when he himself deserved the honor of rule? The woman gave him a magical helm crafted from the skull of a stag, then promised him that taking command from his father would be but the first step toward commanding an army of his own.
 When he woke, he assumed his dream was just that, but then he saw that he still clutched the helm his nocturnal visitor had gifted him. So when his father, drunk and angry, came at him that afternoon, the boy fought back, beating his father to within an inch of death before setting out on his own into the wilderness.
 In the following years, the Stag Lord gathered outcasts and criminals to his side, commanding them with the same brutality he'd learned from his father. He also inherited a fondness for drink from his father, and today spends much of his time in a drunken haze.

<span class="in-box-ability">**Perpetual Hangover** The Stag Lord is in a constant cycling state of being drunk or hungover. As a result, he is constantly [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]], and cannot reduce his sickened state to lower than 1 (although if effects increase his sickened value, he can reduce them back toward 1 as normal). The Stag Lord can willingly ingest food and drink (including potions and elixirs) while sickened. The values in this stat block have been adjusted to account for his sickened state.</span>

The Stag Lord also ignores the penalty for making ranged attacks within his second range increment against the prey he's hunting. The Stag Lord can have only one creature designated as his prey at a time. If he uses Hunt Prey against a creature when he already has a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new prey gains the designation.
