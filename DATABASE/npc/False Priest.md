# False Priest

Belief is perhaps the strongest force in the universe, driving many to great heights. Instilling a sense of belief and then using that belief against someone, however, is the discipline of a false priest. Combining their gifts of deception, a silver tongue, and an impeccable sense of timing, the false priest can gain influence among the powerful, entice a mark to dispose of all their possessions, and make a believer out of a cynic.
