# Sage

The greatest knowledge comes from experience. Village elders, ancient seers, and advisors to royalty are examples of individuals who are valued for their experiences. Sages serve their people as much as their sovereigns. They educate and try to prevent their people from straying from their cultures' acceptable norms and traditions. Sages rarely take power for themselves, as they take their responsibility seriously to guide wisely and empower those they serve.
