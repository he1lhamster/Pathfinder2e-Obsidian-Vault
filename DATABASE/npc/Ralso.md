description: "A child of the Puddles, Ralso grew up hard, orphaned at a young age\
  \ and forced to take care of her sister Cora, who was barely out of infancy. Being\
  \ poor orphans would have been difficult enough, but whatever charity their equally\
  \ hardscrabble neighbors might have mustered for the girls was usually outweighed\
  \ by the poor reputation of their feckless dead parents. With few other options,\
  \ Ralso embraced a life of crime, deciding to take what she needed from a corrupt\
  \ city that would so casually discard her and her family. Though necessity turned\
  \ her hard and merciless\u2014she could slit a dozen throats a day without losing\
  \ sleep\u2014Ralso never lost her affection for her little sister, whom she put\
  \ up in a tenement and paid a local couple to feed and shelter while she went out\
  \ to do her dirty work.<br/><br/> For several years, Ralso was a minor celebrity\
  \ among the thieves and footpads of the city's poorer districts, inspiring fear\
  \ and admiration in equal quantities. Her burgeoning career was cut short when she\
  \ was caught red-handed by the Lotus Guard while burgling a haberdasher in the Petal\
  \ District. Sentenced to five years in the Brine, Absalom's notorious flooded prison,\
  \ Ralso grimly refused to die, becoming a model prisoner and using an assortment\
  \ of corrupt guards and gang contacts to ensure that money kept flowing to the couple\
  \ caring for her sister.<br/><br/> When at last she was released, however, Ralso\
  \ discovered an unbearable truth: The couple she'd been paying to care for her sister\
  \ had developed a drug habit funded by the money Ralso had sent them and had soon\
  \ ignored Cora completely. Locked in her bedroom, the child had starved to death\
  \ less than a year after Ralso began her prison sentence.<br/><br/> The tragedy\
  \ broke Ralso. In a rage, she killed the traitorous couple, then gathered up her\
  \ sister's meager belongings and fled into the city. Though her reputation with\
  \ local gangs remained ironclad due to her toughness and refusal to rat out associates,\
  \ she no longer had any interest in being part of such a group. The only family\
  \ she'd ever cared about was gone, and she drifted through the streets of Absalom\
  \ like a ghost.<br/><br/> This morose half-life lasted until the day Ralso attempted\
  \ to mug a well-dressed and strangely charming traveler named Hendrid Pratchett.\
  \ He caught her in the act, but rather than report her (or kill her in some dank\
  \ alleyway, which he considered), Pratchett took pity on the woman, and something\
  \ about his manner broke through her shell of grief. Soon, Ralso found herself spilling\
  \ out her entire life story, and to her surprise, instead of recoiling at her sordid\
  \ past, Pratchett offered her a job\u2014he'd come to Absalom to do something grand,\
  \ and he'd need an associate with her particular skills. Ralso accepted, and under\
  \ Pratchett's gentle encouragement, she began to reopen her connections with the\
  \ various fences and gangs throughout the city, reestablishing herself as a retired\
  \ but valued member of the criminal underworld. For the first time in years, she\

# Ralso

A child of the Puddles, Ralso grew up hard, orphaned at a young age and forced to take care of her sister Cora, who was barely out of infancy. Being poor orphans would have been difficult enough, but whatever charity their equally hardscrabble neighbors might have mustered for the girls was usually outweighed by the poor reputation of their feckless dead parents. With few other options, Ralso embraced a life of crime, deciding to take what she needed from a corrupt city that would so casually discard her and her family. Though necessity turned her hard and merciless—she could slit a dozen throats a day without losing sleep—Ralso never lost her affection for her little sister, whom she put up in a tenement and paid a local couple to feed and shelter while she went out to do her dirty work.
 For several years, Ralso was a minor celebrity among the thieves and footpads of the city's poorer districts, inspiring fear and admiration in equal quantities. Her burgeoning career was cut short when she was caught red-handed by the Lotus Guard while burgling a haberdasher in the Petal District. Sentenced to five years in the Brine, Absalom's notorious flooded prison, Ralso grimly refused to die, becoming a model prisoner and using an assortment of corrupt guards and gang contacts to ensure that money kept flowing to the couple caring for her sister.
 When at last she was released, however, Ralso discovered an unbearable truth: The couple she'd been paying to care for her sister had developed a drug habit funded by the money Ralso had sent them and had soon ignored Cora completely. Locked in her bedroom, the child had starved to death less than a year after Ralso began her prison sentence.
 The tragedy broke Ralso. In a rage, she killed the traitorous couple, then gathered up her sister's meager belongings and fled into the city.

## Campaign Role

The player characters likely engage Ralso in combat at one point or another during Chapter 4 of this adventure, since she is unwilling to turn over her dearest friend Pratchett without a fight. Never eager to attract attention from the city guard, yet equally unwilling to travel unarmed, she uses a _ring of discretion_ (contraband that would easily land her another five years in prison if discovered) to conceal her various armaments. In combat, Ralso is ferocious and desperate, throwing herself into the fray with seeming disregard for her own life and focusing her attacks on one opponent at a time.
