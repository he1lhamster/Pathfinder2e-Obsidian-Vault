# Hellknight Armiger

_This menacing dwarf wears a suit of armor emblazoned with the symbol of her Hellknight order, and she wields a mighty flail._
 Armigers are the foot soldiers of the Hellknights and form the largest group of members for most orders. Whatever their specific reasons for joining the organization, armigers share the Hellknights' dedication to spreading the rule of law across Golarion. This commitment sees them serving in a variety of missions, whether it be rooting out bandits and crooks, imprisoning smugglers and black marketeers, or investigating rumors of sedition. While frontier villagers sometimes welcome the assurance of safety that the Hellknights bring, free thinkers and historians chafe at the restrictions on movement and expression that armigers enforce.
 Although armigers are not yet full knights, those who underestimate them have made a grievous error. Once ordered to take a position or eliminate a foe, an armiger is unerring in fulfilling their order. During battle, they wade eagerly into the fray, targeting servants of chaotic gods and those they observe using underhanded tactics.

### Myra Bloodforge

Myra felt damned even before she heard of the Hellknights. Her clan was disgraced, stripped of its true name, and cast out from the Five King's Mountains before she was born, for reasons unknown. Many dwarves believe the Bloodforge clan to be cursed, and it's certainly true that many of her family have suffered terrible fates. Abandoned by her kin, Myra turned to the Order of the Gate instead, intending to call forth fiends and practice dark magic to enforce order in the world, and perhaps to break the ill fate that holds her family hostage.
