<span class="in-box-ability">**Absorb Worldly Influence <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (abjuration, divine) **Trigger** Abbot Tsujon is within the emanation of a magical area effect as it's being created; **Requirements** Abbot Tsujon is wielding a khakkhara; **Effect** Abbot Tsujon uses her khakkhara as a medium to absorb the incoming area effect into its central ring. She attempts to counteract the triggering effect. For 1 round after Absorbing Worldly Influence, a glowing orb floats within the khakkhara's central ring, allowing Tsujon to Release Worldly Passions.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**All This Has Happened Before <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (divination, occult) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** The samsaran anchorite is about to roll initiative; **Effect** The anchorite experiences a flash of recognition from a previous existence, gaining a circumstance bonus to the triggering roll. If this causes the anchorite to be the first creature to act, they also become [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened]] for 1 round, but they can use the extra action only to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] or Step.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**All This Will Happen Again <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** (fortune, emotion, mental) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** The samsaran anchorite fails or critically fails a Will save against an emotion effect; **Effect** Even in the face of overwhelming tribulation, the anchorite finds solace in the notion that all things are merely part of a never-ending cycle. They reroll the saving throw with a status bonus; they must use the second result.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Negate Projectiles <span class="action-icon">5</span> ** **Trigger** Abbot Tsujon is the target of a ranged attack; **Requirements** Abbot Tsujon is aware of the attack, is not [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against it, and has a hand free; **Effect** Abbot Tsujon gains a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, the projectile loses momentum and drops harmlessly to the ground.</span>

<span class="in-box-ability">**Crying Bell Stance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (stance) Abbot Tsujon cups one hand and poses the other to strike it, like the Rai Sho Monastery's central bell. In this stance, she can make temple bell Strikes (see Strikes) and gains a +2 status bonus to AC against ranged attacks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Falling Sal Stance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (stance) Abbot Tsujon joins her palms together in the shape of a sal flower, evoking the truth that all things eventually decay. In this stance, she can make sal blossom Strikes (see Strikes) and is [[DATABASE/condition/Quickened|quickened 1]], and can use the extra action only to cast [[DATABASE/feat/Wholeness of Body|wholeness of body]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Release Worldly Passions** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, evocation, force, manipulate) **Requirements** Abbot Tsujon's khakkhara holds a glowing orb from Absorb Worldly Influence; **Effect** Abbot Tsujon strikes her prayer staff once upon the ground, releasing the energy she captured in it along with the jingling of its rings. She blasts a wave of force in a 30- foot emanation, dealing 2d6 force damage per level of the ability she counteracted (DC 40 basic Reflex save). If the ability she counteracted usually deals energy damage, she can choose to deal this type of damage instead (for instance, if she used Absorb Worldly Influence to counteract a [[DATABASE/spell/Fireball|fireball]], she could deal either fire or force damage).</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Stunning Flurry** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** Abbot Tsujon makes two Strikes, each of which must be an unarmed Strike or crying temple bell Strike. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. If either Strike hits and deals damage, the target must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] (or stunned 3 on a critical failure); this save has the incapacitation trait.</span>
