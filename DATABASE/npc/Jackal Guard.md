They attempt separate [[Athletics]] checks to [[Trip]] any number of creatures within their reach. Each attempt counts toward the Jackal Guard's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after they make all the attacks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Spear Vault** <span class="action-icon">2</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The Jackal Guard uses their spear to jump over or around a creature and create an opening. The Jackal Guard Strides up to half their Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. During this movement, they can move through the space of one creature, and when the Jackal Guard moves through a creature's space in this way, that creature becomes [[Flat-Footed]] until the end of the Jackal Guard's turn. If the Jackal Guard ends their movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, they can make a melee Strike against that enemy.</span>
