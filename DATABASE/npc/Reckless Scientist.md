<span class="in-box-ability">**Unstable Compounds** When an attacker scores a critical hit against the reckless scientist, one of the scientist's poorly stowed alchemical items bursts. The GM determines the item randomly. If it was a bomb, the alchemist takes damage from the bomb, and any creature adjacent to the alchemist takes the splash damage. Any other item is simply wasted.</span>

They can Interact to draw a second bomb or elixir if necessary as part of this action. They attempt a DC 28 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] check, destroying both component items to create one new item. If a viable resulting item isn't used by the end of the scientist's next turn, it explodes as described under critical failure. 
**Critical Success** The new item has the full effect of both component items when used. 
**Success** The new item combines both items, but halves the effect of each. (This halves damage for bombs, the amount of healing of [[DATABASE/equipment/Elixir of Life|elixirs of life]], or the duration for effects that can't have their value halved. Details are determined by the GM.) 
**Failure** The new item is inert. 
**Critical Failure** The new item immediately explodes, dealing 3d6 piercing damage to the reckless scientist.</span>

###  Alter Ego Mutagen

A reckless scientist may have a special mutagen with a 1-round onset that transforms them into another specific NPC or monster of their level, with the same duration as other mutagens. All statistics change, though HP changes only if the new maximum HP is lower than the scientist's current HP.
