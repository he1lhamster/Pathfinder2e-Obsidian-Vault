# Raven Nicoletta, Thief Of Fate

Born to a relatively minor noble family in Magnimar, Raven was never comfortable with the life she led. Social functions, overly proper etiquette, and everything else that life in high society brought with it seemed like an unnecessary set of restrictions and rituals for the sake of playing a part.
 As part of a coming-of-age ceremony, Raven was required to recount a history of her family lineage. Delving into her family's past led Raven to discover a buried part of her family history—a major divergence in the family tree after her great-great-grandmother's marriage. When Lonirra married Kamittar Nicoletta, she hid all vestiges of her former family, the Campostari clan. Raven was intrigued by the discovery and soon used the resources afforded to her to learn more about her family's forgotten past.
 Over the span of several months, Raven learned the great history of the Campostari harrowers, including how some of them traced their lineage back to the Imlios clan, a family of archivists, chroniclers, and harrowers dating back to the days before Earthfall. While the connection between Campostari and Imlios was already veil-thin by the Age of Darkness, Raven saw this as a sign. She was indeed fated for a life beyond that of nobility, and her destiny was kept hidden from her for years. With this information in hand, Raven ran away from home, intent on reconnecting with the Campostari side of her lineage.
 Raven's first stop was the city of Korvosa. She believed it big enough for her to start her search, but far enough away from Magnimar to avoid attempts by her family to take her back home. On her first day in the city, she met [[DATABASE/npc/Zellara Esmeranda, Harrowed Soul And Teacher|Zellara Esmeranda]], a local harrower making ends meet by performing readings and teaching new students how to use the harrow. Raven saw this encounter as another sign and immediately became Zellara's student. She spent the next few years living alongside Zellara, learning the secrets of the harrow and seeing Zellara as the mother she never had. During this time, she became aware of her magical abilities and learned to refine them with Zellara's help. After some time, Raven felt she had to move on and seek the Campostari clan, and with Zellara's blessing, the young woman set out from Korvosa.
 When Raven finally did locate her lost clan, she was elated. Unfortunately, the clan was not as eager to meet Raven. They saw Lonirra's abandonment of the clan as a betrayal, and Raven's connection to nobility immediately painted her in a harsh light. Raven's welcome was indifferent at best and, in some case, actively hostile. Heartbroken, Raven returned to Korvosa only to find that Zellara was gone. Unbeknownst to Raven, Zellara had died in the time that Raven was away, and the city's poor records had no information on her fate. Raven even consulted the harrow to try to locate Zellara, but she misinterpreted the lack of guidance as a sign that Zellara had intentionally abandoned her, choosing to hide her tracks even from harrow readings. This second betrayal, as Raven saw it, was enough to turn her bitter and resentful. She decided that if she was going to forge a destiny, she would need to do so on her own.
 Raven dedicated the following years to learning as much about the harrow as she could. Her search for knowledge turned up lost information pertaining to the Imlios clan, their work, and specifically, Sonnorae and the Harrowed Realm. Eventually, her search for knowledge led her to the Harrowed Three and their plan to create [[DATABASE/equipment/The Deck of Destiny|the Deck of Destiny]]. It was in their deck that she saw her ultimate goal: a way to fully claim her own fate once and for all.
 Raven was eventually able to contact [[DATABASE/npc/Drustan, Tyrannical Chelaxian Noble In Exile|Lord Drustan]] and [[DATABASE/npc/The Prince Of Wolves, Abyssal Crime Lord|the Prince of Wolves]]. She formed an alliance with the two. When the time came for the Unmatched to steal the deck, Raven maneuvered Lord Drustan and the Prince of Wolves to lead the attack while she went in and stole the deck, hoping to escape with it before the other two arrived. Raven was unprepared for the norns to scatter the deck, however, so she retreated, hoping to develop a new plan and finally claim the deck for herself.

## Campaign Role

Raven is the most dangerous member of the Unmatched, and is Stolen Fate's true villian. Unlike Lord Drustan and the Prince of Wolves, Raven doesn't simply want to tip the scales of fate in her favor with the Deck of Destiny's harrow reading. She plans to control destiny altogether.

If she is forced to roll twice as part of a fortune and misfortune effect, she can take whichever die result she prefers, even if the effect would normally force her to choose one of the results. Finally, when rolling initiative, Raven can choose not to roll initiative and instead have a result of 16 + her initiative modifier.</span>
