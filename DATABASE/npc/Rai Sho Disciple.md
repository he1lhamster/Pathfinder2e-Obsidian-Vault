<span class="in-box-ability">**Crying Bell Stance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (stance) The disciple cups one hand and poses the other to strike it, like the Rai Sho Monastery's central bell. In this stance, they can make temple bell Strikes (see Strikes). While in this stance, a disciple gains a +2 status bonus to AC against ranged attacks.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Falling Sal Stance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (stance) The disciple joins their palms together in the shape of a sal flower, evoking the truth that all things eventually decay. In this stance, they can make sal blossom Strikes (see Strikes) and are [[Quickened]], and can use the extra action only to cast [[Wholeness of Body]].</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Flurry of Blows** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The Rai Sho disciple makes two Strikes, each of which must be an unarmed Strike or temple bell Strike. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.</span><span class="in-box-ability">**Nine Seals Spellcasting** The Rai Sho disciples have learned a technique to cast their ki spells more effectively by way of specialized hand postures. They replace the normal somatic and verbal components of their spells with nine seals components; these require that the user have a hand free, but do not add any traits to the Cast a Spell action (preventing the disciples from triggering certain reactions when they Cast a Spell, such as [[Attack of Opportunity]]). Additionally, the first time each day that a disciple critically Strikes an enemy, they regain a Focus Point.</span>
