description: 'Zane is the scion of a noble family in the Nine Walls, the homeland
  of Matanji orcs in the Mwangi expanse. He has natural charm and good looks and fully
  expects to become an ambassador for his people when he''s older. He considers his
  education at the Magaambya to be a pleasant dalliance, and he spends most his time
  with the friends he''s made there. Zane is an intelligent young man with something
  of a lazy streak, simply putting in the necessary work to get by.<br/><br/> When
  Zane was a toddler, his parents gave him to local priests for a blessing in a local
  river. Playful water spirits took notice of the baby and stole him from the inattentive
  priests. Zane''s parents believed he''d been drowned and lost. A year and a day
  after Zane disappeared, he washed back up on the banks of the river and was reunited
  with his relieved but puzzled family. Since then, Zane has felt the stirring of
  fey magic within him, but his family insisted on putting the disappearance firmly
  in the past and moving on. Zane''s budding powers frightened his family, so he learned
  to keep them hidden, something he no longer has to do since his enrollment in the
  Magaambya.<br/><br/> Due to his charm, Zane is quick to make friends, but he''s
  found he has the most in common with Ekene. The two both know how it feels to be
  misunderstood and understand the heavy weight of the expectations placed upon them
  by their families and communities.<br/><br/><b><u>Recall Knowledge - Humanoid</u>

# Zealot

Zealots ferret out plots against their religion and seek justice for their church's followers. This zealot serves [[DATABASE/deity/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]], but others might serve [[DATABASE/deity/Abadar|Abadar]], [[DATABASE/deity/Calistria|Calistria]], [[DATABASE/deity/Iomedae|Iomedae]], [[DATABASE/deity/Norgorber|Norgorber]], [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]], [[DATABASE/deity/Sarenrae|Sarenrae]], or [[DATABASE/deity/Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthon]]. They often ride a [[DATABASE/monster/War Horse|war horse]] wearing light barding. This horse is an additional monster in the fight.
