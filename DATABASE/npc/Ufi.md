# Ufi

An orphan raised in the Mugumo Plains by doting farmers, Ufi always enjoyed the simple things in life. He grew to be a strong, thoughtful young man, eager to help harvest crops, build farmhouses, or haul furniture. Ufi loved his family and his village and considered himself blessed by the love they showed him in return.
 During an outing to collect wood, Ufi discovered an ancient set of stone beads engraved with an intricate design resembling rays of light. A passing pilgrim took note of the beads and identified them as sacred to [[DATABASE/deity/Tlehar|Tlehar]], an ancient goddess once worshipped in the city of Mzali. The pilgrim told the village that Ufi was blessed by Tlehar, destined for greater things, and he recommended Ufi hone his skills at the Magaambya. Ufi felt uncertain about leaving his village, but he traveled with the pilgrim to Nantambu, learning of Tlehar's lore along the way. He now wishes to learn as much as he can about magic and his new faith, and he hopes to protect his classmates and make his village proud.
 Ufi likes all his fellow students, but he's particularly captivated by Zane's easygoing demeanor and wit.
