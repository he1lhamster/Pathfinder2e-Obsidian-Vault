# Charming Scoundrel

_This handsome gnome sports an impressive coiffure and a flashy costume that catches the eye._
While most Firebrands enjoy the attention their exploits bring, the charming scoundrel takes this to extremes, often boasting about their daring exploits and attempting to parlay stories of their notorious deeds into free drinks or lodging. The scoundrel sees little harm in taking credit for any activities attributed to the organization, provided that intervention from local law enforcement seems unlikely. They are likely to take on high-profile jobs for the Firebrands just for the thrill of later recounting the narrow scrapes of their adventure.
 The charming scoundrel is as dramatic in combat as outside of it, often darting from opponent to opponent and disorienting foes with flashy swordplay. If a battle is going well, the scoundrel will often shout taunts at slow-footed opponents or encouragement to allies. While prideful and competitive, the scoundrel is a pragmatist at heart and will opt to add a tale of a cunning escape to their repertoire if the odds seem stacked against them.

### Vanton Finch

Vanton is a bold and dashing rogue, but he also considers himself a romantic at heart. He can never resist a chance to show off for beautiful onlookers, even when his bravado gets him into trouble. Vanton makes sure to keep up with society, and has a cursory knowledge of all the most fashionable plays, songs, and most importantly, love sonnets. Though he may seem like nothing more than a shallow performer with an overstuffed ego, Vanton Finch can be truly brutal in a fight if his life is on the line—the same flippant tricks he uses to put on a show in front of bystanders can also be used as deadly feints and unfair combat tactics.
