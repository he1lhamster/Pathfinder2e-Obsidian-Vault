You experience a brief resurgence of a mutagen. Choose one mutagen you’ve consumed since your last daily preparations. You gain the effects of that mutagen for 1 minute.

## Field Discovery<span class="item-type">Level 5</span>

When using advanced alchemy to make mutagens during your daily preparations, you can use a batch of reagents to create any three mutagens instead of just two of the same mutagen.

## Perpetual Infusions<span class="item-type">Level 7</span>

Choose two 1st-level mutagens.

## Perpetual Potency<span class="item-type">Level 11</span>

Choose two 3rd-level or lower mutagens.

## Greater Field Discovery<span class="item-type">Level 13</span>

If you imbibe another mutagen while you are under the effects of a mutagen that you created, you can gain the benefits and the drawbacks of both mutagens at once, despite the fact that they both have the polymorph trait and would not normally function together. If you come under the effects of any further mutagens while benefiting from two mutagens, you lose the benefit of one of the former mutagens of your choice, while retaining the drawbacks of all the mutagens. If you are under the effects of two mutagens and you come under the effect of a non-mutagen polymorph effect, you lose the benefits of the mutagens while retaining the drawbacks of both.

## Perpetual Perfection<span class="item-type">Level 17</span>

Choose two 11th-level or lower mutagens.
