Your pursuit is relentless, and you are able to magically locate stolen objects and outlaws. You gain [[Locate]] as an innate spell of a tradition of your choice, which you can cast once per day. If you are a member of the Order of the Gate, when you reach 14th level, the spell is heightened to 5th level.

You can call in devils to assist your efforts. You gain [[Summon Fiend]] as an innate spell of a tradition of your choice, which you can cast once per day. When you cast this spell, you can summon only creatures that have the devil trait. At 16th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened by 1 level (to a maximum of 8th level when you reach 20th level).
