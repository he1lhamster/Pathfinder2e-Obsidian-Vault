You gain [[DATABASE/spell/Locate|locate]] as an innate spell of a tradition of your choice, which you can cast once per day. If you are a member of the Order of the Gate, when you reach 14th level, the spell is heightened to 5th level.

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You can call in devils to assist your efforts. You gain [[DATABASE/spell/Summon Fiend|summon fiend]] as an innate spell of a tradition of your choice, which you can cast once per day.
