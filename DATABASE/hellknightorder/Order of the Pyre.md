# Order of the Pyre

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
**Favored Weapon** [[DATABASE/weapon/Glaive|Glaive]]
The Order of the Pyre is dedicated to eliminating those faiths and beliefs they consider to be a threat to the Inner Sea region. They are particularly keen on stamping out dangerous cults.

## Righteous Resistance <span class="item-type">Lesser Benefit</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Resist Energy|resist energy]] twice per day as a divine innate spell, except you can target only yourself. If you grant yourself resistance to fire damage, the resistance is equal to either the spell’s normal value or to your level, whichever is higher.

## Spiritual Disruption <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Greater Benefit</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You channel disruptive power that severs a foe’s spiritual connection to their heretical magic. Make a melee Strike. If the attack hits, any time the target attempts to cast a divine or occult spell, the spell is disrupted unless they succeed at a DC 5 flat check (DC 7 on a critical hit); if the target is also [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]], it must attempt the harder of the two flat checks (but not both). This effect lasts for 1 minute.
