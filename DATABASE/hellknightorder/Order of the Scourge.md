# Order of the Scourge

**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
**Favored Weapons** [[Mace]], [[Scourge]], [[Whip]]
Hellknights of the Order of the Scourge hunt those who pervert the law for their own selfish ends. They seek to destroy corruption and those who hide behind unjust laws and bureaucracy.

When you roll a success on a save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, any time you gain the [[Frightened]] condition, reduce the condition’s value by 1. As usual, this ability reduces the initial [[Frightened]] condition by 1, so if you have multiple similar abilities, they don’t both take effect.

**Frequency** once per day
With a moment spent focusing, you can locate the telltale signs of corruption no matter what means it may use to hide from your sight. For 1 minute, you can see through up to 5 feet of stone, wood, or similar barriers as if they didn’t exist (though any amount of metal or denser barriers block this effect).
