# Order of the Nail

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
**Favored Weapons** [[DATABASE/weapon/Halberd|Halberd]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Lance|Lance]]
Members of the Order of the Nail see civilized society as an ideal and seek to unite all people within their cultural baseline. They also seek to destroy anyone who does not accept Chelaxian culture along with the wild beasts that threaten the safety of civilization.

## Trailblazing Stride <span class="item-type">Lesser Benefit</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You are used to moving through the wilderness. While moving on land, you ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain.

## Reveal Beasts <span class="item-type">Greater Benefit</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You are adept at revealing—or creating—weaknesses among those who are a threat to civilization. If you roll a success on a check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] to identify an animal or a beast, you get a critical success instead. The next time you damage that creature, it gains weakness 5 during that attack to one damage type of your choice that you dealt it.
