# The Infinite Eye

**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
The true strength of the mind lies in the knowledge it contains, with each new observation contributing to the totality of its experiences. To grow your experiences—and with them, your power—you devote yourself to observing as much as possible, casting your senses through space and time with clairvoyance and precognition.

## Detect Magic

You have the kind of fine control that other spellcasters can only dream of. When you cast _detect magic_, you're aware of any creature in the emanation affected by a spell or carrying a magic item, and you determine the main location of magic within any magical hazard in the emanation (with the normal restrictions on detecting illusions). This typically manifests as an alteration to your vision, such as seeing a soft aura around the creature or hazard. Sensing these phenomena doesn't make it clear which spell is on a creature, nor which of its items are magical. Your _detect magic_ also gains the following amp.
**Amp** Your pulse of detection magic helps you gain a sense of nearby magic's strengths or weaknesses. When you detect the presence of magic on an enemy or hazard, you gain a +1 status bonus to saves against magic originating from that enemy or hazard for 3 rounds. If you find magic from multiple sources with a single casting of _detect magic_, you get the bonus against all of them.
**Amp Heightened (7th)** The status bonus to saves against magic increases to +2.

## Guidance

You have eyes everywhere, allowing you to guide people from a great distance. The range of _guidance_ increases to 120 feet. It also gains the following amp.
**Amp** You can project a flash of insight to your ally in the nick of time to save them from failure. Amped _guidance_ doesn't cause a creature to become temporarily immune to _guidance_, and a creature can be targeted by amped _guidance_ even if it is temporarily immune to _guidance_.
 You can cast an amped _guidance_ spell as a reaction triggered when your ally fails or critically fails an attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check, and the bonus from _guidance_ would change the failure to a success or the critical failure to a normal failure. The bonus from _guidance_ applies retroactively to their check.
**Amp Heightened (6th)** The bonus from the spell increases to +2.
