# The Unbound Step

**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
The mind can flit from thought to thought; why too shouldn't you? You focus on motion in a higher order of spatial dimensions, not just the typical three, allowing for versatile abilities that alter positioning.
1st: _[[Thoughtful Gift]]_; 2nd: _[[Enlarge]]_; 3rd: _[[Rally Point]]_; 4th: _[[Dimension Door]]_; 5th: _[[Strange Geometry]]_; 6th: _[[Collective Transposition]]_; 7th: _[[Momentary Recovery]]_; 8th: _[[Maze]]_; 9th: _[[Bilocation]]_
**Standard Psi Cantrips** _[[Phase Bolt]]_ and _[[Warp Step]]_
**Unique Psi Cantrips** surface: _[[Distortion Lens]]_; deeper: _[[Ghostly Shift]]_; deepest: _[[Tesseract Tunnel]]_

## Phase Bolt

Your _phase bolt_ temporarily sends the target's cover out of phase if it hits. On a success, reduce the target's circumstance bonus to AC (if any) by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. Your _phase bolt_ also gains the following amp.
**Amp** Your bolt leaves phase completely, becoming invisible and intangible until it's already embedded in the target— giving the impression it simply teleported itself into place. The target is [[Flat-Footed]] against the attack. Additionally, the bolt ignores an amount of Hardness or resistance to piercing damage equal to half the spell's level. On a critical success, the target can't be affected by teleportation effects until the start of your next turn.
**Amp Heightened (+1)** The bolt's damage increases by 2d4 instead of 1d4.

## Warp Step

You warp space more compactly, granting you a +10-foot status to your Speed instead of a +5-foot status bonus when you _warp step_. The spell also gains the following amp.
**Amp** Space contracts with hardly a thought, letting you Cast the Spell as a single action.
**Amp Heightened (4th)** You twist space so completely you don't need to travel the interposing distance. You can choose to instead teleport to a space within your line of sight and line of effect with a range equal to your double your Speed (after applying the status bonus from _warp step_). This grants the spell the teleportation trait.
