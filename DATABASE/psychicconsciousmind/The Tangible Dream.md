# The Tangible Dream

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
You pull colors and shapes from the depth of your mind, projecting impossible creations into the world as tapestries of astral thread or sculptures of force and light.

## Dancing Lights

Your _dancing lights_ can float wherever you like. After creating the lights, they can move more than 10 feet from the other lights, and more than 120 feet from you. Your _dancing lights_ also gain the following amp.
**Amp** Your lights whirl together, dazzlingly and hypnotically. When you amp the spell, you create a flashing display comprised of all four lights in an unoccupied 5-foot square. If you move the lights when you Sustain the Spell, the lights must remain together. The spell gains the visual trait. Each creature in a 5-foot emanation around the lights when you Cast the Spell must attempt a Fortitude save.
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the start of your next turn and then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Failure** The creature is dazzled until the start of your next turn and must attempt a new save against the spell whenever it starts its turn adjacent to the lights.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]] by the lights until the start of your next turn.

## Shield

Your _shield_ spell can be deployed on behalf of others. When you cast _shield_, you can choose a target ally within 30 feet to gain the benefits of the spell instead of you. The option to [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] with the spell is up to you and uses your reaction, not the target's. Your _shield_ also gains the following amp.
**Amp** You create a layered barrier of three shields to improve your defenses. The duration increases to sustained up to 1 minute. The shield still lowers at the start of each of your turns, but you can raise it again when you Sustain the Spell.
 When you Shield Block with this spell, one of the three layers breaks and you cease to gain the bonus to AC, but the spell doesn't end. You can keep using the spell until the final layer breaks; once it does, the spell ends and you can't cast _shield_ or amped _shield_ again for 10 minutes. You can choose to break additional layers when you Shield Block with this spell to improve your defenses. If you break two layers instead of one, increase the Hardness to 1-1/2 × the normal amount (7 at 1st level, 15 at 3rd level, 22 at 5th level, 30 at 7th level, and 37 at 9th level). If you break all three layers, increase the Hardness to double the normal amount.
