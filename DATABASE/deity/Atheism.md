# Atheism [No Alignment]

In a world where the gods demonstrably exist, few people uphold a strictly atheistic or agnostic worldview; that is, a belief that there are no gods, or that the existence of gods is unknowable. However, a good number of people choose not to worship any deities whatsoever. Many do so because of the value they place on freedom—not being beholden to a deity means no limitations, no censure, no anathema, and no strictures. While this decision might sound amoral to some, for atheists, it can be motivated by a desire for autonomy and the right to choose one's own fate.
