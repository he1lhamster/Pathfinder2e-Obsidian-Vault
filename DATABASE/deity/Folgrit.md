# Folgrit (The Watchful Mother) [LG]

**Source** [[Highhelm]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Some myths say that long before her marriage, Folgrit was the Goddess of Mourners, one who watched over and protected those left behind in bereavement after massive wars and calamities. She witnessed many dwarves, especially orphans, left adrift to fend for themselves against the world and the dwarven community at large. Determined to save these individuals from the fate of an outcast, she approached the then-bachelor [[Torag]] with a proposal: in exchange for her hand in marriage, he would share his powers of family and protection with her. The union was a celebrated affair for the pantheon. In addition to sharing the agreed-upon powers, Torag also gifted Folgrit oversight of settlements and cities, so that she could ensure those under her care shall always have shelter
