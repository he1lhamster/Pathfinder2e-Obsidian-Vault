# Verilorn (Custodian of Oak and Ash) [No Alignment]

**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
Verilorn, Lord of Wood, Custodian of Oak and Ash, is a gardener. While some might consider gardening to be a free-flowing form of creation, Verilorn believes his gardens should be orderly and exact above all else. The towering trees that fill his arboretums are precise in their positioning and meticulous in their size and shade. Verilorn knows when a sprout will form into wood with such nicety that even the deities who govern time take inspiration.
