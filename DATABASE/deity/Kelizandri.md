# Kelizandri (The Brackish Emperor) [No Alignment]

**Source** [[Rage of Elements]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Kelizandri, the elemental lord of water, oversees the deep sea, waves, and drowning. The Brackish Emperor claims to be the offspring of an ancient god and a [[Dragon, Brine]], and he usually takes the form of an immense aquatic dragon with metallic scales and crystalline talons. He spends much of his time slumbering in his magnificent Palace of Salt and Bones, entertaining himself with rampages of wanton destruction and conquest whenever he wakes.
 Kelizandri's worshippers include brine dragons, [[Elemental, Water]], and mortals who revere the inhospitable unknowns of the deep sea. He holds no love for [[Marid]], having killed the last Saline Padishah, Niloufar the Great, and destroyed her capital city of Arzanib. The lord's domain on the [[Plane of Water]] is the Brackish Empire Kelizandrika, a conglomeration of affiliated brine dragon–controlled realms. The most powerful dragons of Kelizandrika's ruling councils are said to advise the elemental lord personally.
