# Bolka (The Golden Gift) [NG]

**Source** [[Highhelm]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Bolka is the dwarven goddess of marriage. Forged by [[Torag]] as a symbol of his love for [[Folgrit]], Bolka's golden-brown skin, eyes of pure bismuth, and honey-blonde hair were a symbol of the passion and beauty he saw in Folgrit. When Folgrit received this gift, she immediately breathed life into the child, and claimed Bolka to be a symbol of their marriage and eternal commitment.
