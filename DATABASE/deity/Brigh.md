# Brigh (The Whisper In Bronze) [N]

**Source** [[Gods & Magic]] 
Brigh’s exact origins are unknown, though her priests and various religious scholars have many theories on the matter. Some believe she was a construct who achieved consciousness and a spark of divinity, while others think she was a human alchemist and inventor who discovered ways to fuse mechanical components with her own physiology. Regardless of her origins, Brigh is a patient and thoughtful god who promotes unending curiosity and constant intellectual advancement. Her two most common forms are a humanoid woman made of bronze clockwork and a human woman wearing a bronze skullcap and armor composed of gears and other movable metal pieces. Though Brigh’s usual demeanor is composed and reserved, she isn’t an unfeeling automaton; she deeply cherishes the creations she and her followers make, and most of her worshippers feel the same way.

**Minor Boon**: Knowledge floods your mind. Once, you can reroll a failed skill check to [[Recall Knowledge]]; you must use the second result, even if it’s worse.
**Moderate Boon**: You become a wellspring of invention. You gain the [[Inventor]] feat, even if you don’t meet its prerequisites, and when you roll a [[Crafting]] check for the Inventor feat, you use the result one degree of success better than the result you rolled.
**Major Boon**: You gain the companionship of a loyal construct ally of Brigh’s choice at least 1 level lower than you. If the construct is destroyed, it rebuilds itself over the course of a week, and as you gain levels, the construct upgrades and improves itself, becoming more powerful.
**Minor Curse**: Your hands shake when attempting delicate work. All your failures to [[Craft]] or [[Repair]] are instead critical failures.
**Moderate Curse**: Whenever you try to perform engineering or science tasks, everything just seems to explode. Whenever you attempt to create or use an alchemical item or a construct, [[Disable a Device]], and so on, you must attempt a DC 15 flat check. On a failure, something explodes and you take 1d6 fire damage (or a different type of damage, if appropriate) per level of the item, construct, or device (DC 40 basic Reflex save).
**Major Curse**: Constructs—even mindless constructs you thought you could control—seek your demise. All constructs are [[Hostile]] to you and attack you when they notice your presence. Occasionally, inanimate statues and other objects animate as constructs to pursue Brigh’s vengeance.
