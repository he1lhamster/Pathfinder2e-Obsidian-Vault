# The Enlightened Scholar's Path [NG]

**Source** [[Travel Guide]]
This broad and erudite pantheon is a favorite in universities and academies across the Inner Sea. Its adherents unite the optimism and art of [[Shelyn]] with the vast knowledge of [[Thoth]] to inspire their investigations and writings of artistic, scientific, historical, and magical knowledge. They look to [[Andoletta]], Grandmother Crow, for aid in teaching and instilling knowledge and virtue as well as to [[Likha]] to support their efforts to teach (especially with a wide historical perspective), perform plays, and organize recitals and lectures in the name of learning.
 They appeal to [[Soralyon]] for protection, particularly of historical buildings, monuments, artifacts, and their study of such things. For especially thorny problems and for help in devising new solutions from their research, they turn to the [[Zohls]], the embodiment of Verity. Religious ceremonies tend to be full of pageantry, pomp, and ritual, incorporating plays, chorales, and instrumental music that draw on many different traditions and highlight ancient practices of beauty. These ceremonies occur quite regularly at or near academies across the Inner Sea and I highly recommend you make every effort to attend one. Be aware, though, they do tend to last for hours, so you'll want to plan accordingly!
