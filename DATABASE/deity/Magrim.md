# Magrim (The Taskmaster) [LN]

**Source** [[Highhelm]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Magrim is not the leader of the dwarven pantheon, but he holds a special place of honor and authority as the eldest among them. As the dwarven deity of both fate and death, his solemn duty is to ensure that every dwarf born on Golarion is granted both a unique mortal purpose and an achievable path to its fulfillment; the specifics of this charge vary from dwarf to dwarf, frequently focusing on the creation of something great and wonderful that will long outlast its creator. The faith of Magrim teaches that few tasks are of more paramount importance than ensuring that time-honored traditions are properly observed, that dwarven language and culture remain as constant and unchanging as possible, and that all dwarves are provided with access to whatever knowledge and tools are necessary to accomplish that which is expected of them. The surest path to a productive and satisfying mortal existence is to carefully follow one's prescribed destiny and purpose, and while those who choose to eschew this purpose in favor of forging their own paths are not shunned or looked down upon, conventional sentiment is that a dwarf who ignores the instructions clearly laid out for them by the Taskmaster does so at their own peril.
