# Trudd (The Mighty) [NG]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Highhelm|Highhelm]], [[DATABASE/source/Gods & Magic|Gods & Magic]] 
In crafting Trudd as a gift for his beloved, [[DATABASE/deity/Torag|Torag]] thought of the qualities he'd not given his other children. After a few moments of contemplation, he settled on the simplest and most elusive answer—he had not gifted his wife with a child who bore the strength of the mountains themselves. He was to be his father's strong left hand, acting as the general of Torag's armies when defending [[DATABASE/plane/Heaven|Heaven]] from incursions by [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demons]] or other such nefarious forces. Trudd's personal charge was to guard the seat of Forgeheart when the Father of Creation traveled the multiverse. Trudd took to these dual tasks with glee and has been doing his duty ever since.
