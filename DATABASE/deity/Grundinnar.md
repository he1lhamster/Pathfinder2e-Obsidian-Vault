# Grundinnar (The Peacemaker) [LG]

**Source** [[Highhelm]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
When Torag was forging Grundinnar, he graced him with a tongue of silver, and a heart of gold and iron. When [[Folgrit]] saw this gift and breathed life into him, she asked that Grundinnar be kind and loving always. He took this as both mandate and life goal, and now works to bring peace and familial connection to all who worship him and their allies. It's said that Grundinnar practiced quelling conflict by saving his sister [[Bolka]] from her many suitors, and in doing so learned to forge peace, but this is only half-truth. He truly learned to be a peacemaker by dealing with his bickering family, for even the gods among dwarves can be quarrelsome and taciturn.
