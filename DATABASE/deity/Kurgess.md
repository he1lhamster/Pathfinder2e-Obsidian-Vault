## Divine Intercession

The Strong Man’s gifts reflect his mastery of might.
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gods & Magic - Web Supplement|Gods & Magic - Web Supplement]]
**Minor Boon**: The Strong Man blesses you with a measure of his strength. Increase your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 2.
**Moderate Boon**: You fear no exertion. You can employ exploration tactics normally while [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]].
**Major Boon**: You possess a true champion’s might. When you roll a critical failure on an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check, you get a failure instead, and when you roll a success, you instead get a critical success.
**Minor Curse**: Difficulty lifting burdens is a sign of divine disapproval. Your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits decrease by 2.
**Moderate Curse**: Kurgess’s displeasure breaks your competitive edge, causing you to fail at the cusp of success. If your check result exactly equals the DC, you fail instead of succeeding.
**Major Curse**: The wrath of Kurgess withers you almost to nothing. You are permanently [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 2]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 4]].
