# Angradd (The Forge-Fire) [LG]

**Source** [[Highhelm]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Forge-Fire, Army-Cleaver, High Marshall, The Tempered. Worshipers of Angradd call on him by many names as they join battle against enemies that threaten the stability of their communities. The most aggressive and proactive of the gods in the dwarven pantheon, Angradd calls on his followers to seek out and destroy foes of the dwarven people, not simply fortify themselves from danger or put their trust in defensive measures. Often depicted in art as a powerful, axe-wielding warrior with hair and beard of flame, Angradd is venerated by those burning with zeal to seek out and destroy evil. During the Quest for Sky, Angradd's followers often formed the vanguard for the migrating dwarven nation, striking out against the many monsters, hazards, and foes that stood between the dwarves and the surface. Philosophically, followers of Angradd consider each opponent they strike down to be fuel for their fire, contending that each challenge allows them to grow their strength and spread their god's influence like the light from a beacon in the darkness.
