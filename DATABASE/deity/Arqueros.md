# Arqueros (The Golden Bulwark) [LG]

**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
As strong in will as he is in form, Arqueros is Lord of the Wall, guardian of [[Heaven]], and empyreal lord of bodyguards, protection, and watchfulness. He maintains eternal vigil at Heaven's gates, resplendent in gold armor and clutching a diamond-headed spear. Whatever the truth of his heart, Arqueros is composed in the face of dire threats and is a stalwart defender who would die before abandoning his duties.
