# Shumunue (The Carved Lady of Mimicry) [No Alignment]

**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
Shumunue, Lord of Wood, is one of the few elemental lords not native to their plane of rule. Before the Carved Lady of Mimicry arrived on the [[Plane of Wood]], it was a diverse and cultivated forest that stretched as far as the eye could see, yet it was eerily still. Animated creatures were rare, and beyond the wind through the boughs, little moved. Then Shumunue came to establish the Court of Transcendence. In her grotto, she taught the flowers and leaves to mimic praying mantises, bees, and moths. Then came herds of wooden deer, cranes, bats, and more, all delicately carved and polished. Within their minds, Shumunue imparted to these creatures the blueprints for their species and the instinct to carve their own descendants. Thus the Plane of Wood began to fill with life that resembled creatures from beyond its borders.
