# Kols (The Oathkeeper) [LN]

As [[DATABASE/deity/Torag|Torag's]] firstborn, Kols was always a serious child. He watched how his father, chief among the dwarven gods, struggled to create deals and oaths that other deities would betray at their earliest convenience. He grew angry at the setbacks Torag had to endure from those who swore friendship but instead used him for their own selfish ends. Kols was baptized in the fires of being the eldest of Torag's children, a firsthand witness to his father's fury and pain. He thus vowed that he would do everything in his power to protect his father's followers, and also keep a record of those who had broken deals, broken faith, or shirked their duty in any way.
