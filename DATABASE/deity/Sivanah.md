# Sivanah (The Seventh Veil) [N]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gods & Magic|Gods & Magic]] 
No ancient record reveals the truth of Sivanah’s origins; in fact, only recent documents record her existence at all. The Seventh Veil is widely regarded as the goddess of illusion magic, often portrayed as a figure disguised by seven veils. Legends state that each face underneath the first six of her seven veils is of a different ancestry—human, elf, halfling, gnome, anadi, and naga— but the seventh face is never shown, believed to mask the goddess’s true form. Some theologians believe Sivanah hails from the Shadow Plane, though the goddess’s true nature and form continue to be topics of debate. Even her female visage, while agreed upon by her followers, could likewise be an illusion. Her goals are hidden from even her most faithful, which some believe to have hampered the faith’s growth and influence beyond the level of a cult.

## Divine Intercession

The Seventh Veil abhors the use of illusion to cause harm and detests anyone who discourages or corrupts the process of truth-seeking. The goddess works actively against the faith of Zon-Kuthon and his clerics’ use of shadow.

**Minor Boon**: Sivanah prevents your enemies from pulling off your veil. Once, when a foe rolls a success on a Perception check to disbelieve your illusion, it gets a critical failure instead. Sivanah typically grants this benefit to protect an elaborate or consequential illusory deception, and she never uses it to improve the effect of a harmful illusion.
**Moderate Boon**: You wear a veil of illusion wherever you go. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Illusory Disguise|illusory disguise]] at will as an innate divine spell.
**Major Boon**: You spread your illusions over a larger area. You can designate an area to permanently gain the effects of [[DATABASE/spell/Hallucinatory Terrain|hallucinatory terrain]]. All creatures within this area gain the effects of _illusory disguise_, changing their forms as you wish. You can designate a new area as a 1-minute activity, but doing so dismisses any previously designated areas.
**Minor Curse**: Your hair becomes a wild variety of colors, which cannot be altered with mundane or magical means, and it somehow grows out from under any cap, scarf, or other headwear intended to disguise it. You gain a –2 status penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] skill checks to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] anyone else.
**Moderate Curse**: Those who betray the secrets of others find their own secrets laid bare. Each person from whom you are keeping a secret immediately learns one of your secrets involving that person. This curse doesn’t give away other people’s secrets you are keeping, only your own.
**Major Curse**: Mirrors break whenever you cross their paths. You cannot be concealed by illusion magic of any kind (the spell automatically fails), and all creatures that see you know your true identity
