# Chamidu (The Roar of the Storm) [N]

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Chamidu is an original guardian of the wild, a deity sworn to protect the life of nature. In addition to the beasts of the wild, whom Chamidu regards as her own children, she was also placed in charge of the Kalpavendi, a deific tree fabled to be capable of healing any illness, curse, or calamity cast upon mortal or god alike. It's at this site that new beasts of the land are born and where legends say Chamidu takes those most worthy of her blessing to grant perfect health for all their life. Many go in search of the Kalpavendi, though few ever return. Nonetheless, seekers of the holy tree are undeterred and continue their pilgrimage.
