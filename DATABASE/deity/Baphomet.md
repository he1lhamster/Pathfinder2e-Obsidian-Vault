# Baphomet (Lord of the Labyrinth) [CE]

**Source** [[Gods & Magic]] 
Baphomet, Lord of the Labyrinth, is the demon lord of beasts, labyrinths, and minotaurs. Baphomet was originally a consort of [[Lamashtu]] who achieved demon lord status after escaping from imprisonment in a labyrinth constructed by [[Asmodeus]]. Baphomet appears as an enormous emaciated minotaur with feathered wings and a goat-like head that bears three horns, as well as a blazing pentagram branded into his forehead. Baphomet’s cults are among the most prolific in Golarion—human-dominated secret societies devoted to the demon lord are present in many cities and may have members ensconced in positions of political power, while most minotaurs prefer his patronage to that of Lamashtu.
