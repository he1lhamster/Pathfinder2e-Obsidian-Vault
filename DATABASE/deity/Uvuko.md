# Uvuko (The Diamond Ring) [CG]

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] 
The god Uvuko dances across the land, his body forming the boundary between earth and sky. His twisting tail churns the air into clouds, his creations spreading water to all those who thirst. His sliding scales till the earth, bringing forth plants that are nourished by Uvuko's rains. The worship of Uvuko is widespread in the Mwangi Expanse, found among many [[Lizardfolk]] tribes, Mbe'ke and Taralu [[Dwarf]], and in the more cosmopolitan cities.
