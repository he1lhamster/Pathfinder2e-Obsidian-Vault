# Ferrumnestra (The Lady of Rust) [No Alignment]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
Just as the birth of every mortal begins another inexorable march toward the grave, the infinitesimally slow decline of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Metal|Plane of Metal]] began eons ago at the moment of its creation. The plane has been deteriorating for as long as it has existed, and Ferrumnestra, the Lady of Rust, has always been there to shepherd it along toward its distant but inevitable end. Her charge is to eternally traverse the plane, consuming the last vestiges of its planar material as it crumbles into its most basic elements. Only nonexistence remains in her wake.
**Category** Elemental Lords
**Edicts** accept the inevitable, clear what remains of that which has fallen to ruin, usher the past into obscurity
