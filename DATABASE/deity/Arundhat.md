# Arundhat (The Sacred Perfume) [NG]

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Arundhat is the god of blossoms and scent, most commonly worshipped in Vudra. While followers who worship deities of war or strength often consider Arundhat's portfolio a little lackluster, to those with the right knowledge, the humble flower can accomplish far more than a simple show of force. Arundhat's mastery of botanicals and scented oils can bring someone back from near death, sway a person to passion, or calm an agitated mob.
