# The Resplendent Court [N]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Firebrands|Firebrands]]
Whether it's a uniquely patterned shawl woven of the softest wool or a gem-studded brooch retrieved from a sunken temple, followers of the Resplendent Court take pride in their adornments and the efforts that went into procuring them. This disparate group of deities attracts followers who universally hold the belief that looking one's best is always worth the effort. Some critics dismiss the Resplendent Court as shallow materialists, but the faithful see the process of securing fine garments, altering them to fit, choosing the proper accessories, and donning them for the proper occasion as a significant ritual of self-expression and self-worth. To these worshippers, what someone wears is the outward expression of the inner identity, the ultimate declaration that they'll dress and act as they see fit.
 Many a gathering of Firebrands who worship the Resplendent Court has turned into an impromptu fashion show as the faithful display their latest finds and creations. These believers also enjoy the prestige of rediscovering legendary pieces of jewelry or gems thought long lost. After all, a signature look is an important part of building a reputation for an ambitious Firebrand, and a sparkling ensemble is as likely to leave a lasting impression as a sparkling personality.
