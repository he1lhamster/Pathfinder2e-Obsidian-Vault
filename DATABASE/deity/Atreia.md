# Atreia (The Lambent King) [No Alignment]

**Source** [[Rage of Elements]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Responsible for fire, purification, and radiance, Atreia the Lambent King is the benevolent elemental lord of fire. When the multiverse was young, Atreia soared across the [[Plane of Fire]] as a triple-headed ibis, with wings that burned and eyes of flame, routing evil from the plane. Now, he is imprisoned within the _Garnet Brand_, a red gem encased in an eternal shroud of steam. Though he cannot hear or grant power to his followers from his prison, some groups of [[Salamander]] on the Plane of Fire still honor the Lambent King for his dominion over protection and life-giving fire, as do a few small circles of mortals who hold the discovery and purification of evil above all other causes. Statues depicting his likeness can be found across his former realms, hidden in ancient sites dedicated to healing and holy light.
