# Ymeri (Queen of the Inferno) [No Alignment]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]], [[DATABASE/source/Gods & Magic|Gods & Magic]] 
The elemental lord of fire is Ymeri, Queen of the Inferno, lord of fire, heat, and smoke. The sole ruler of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], Ymeri governs from her Auroric Palace, taking the form of a six-armed reptilian centaur with burning wings. She has systematically destroyed all record of her birth and true origins, claiming to have always existed, and she wages a never-ending war against the other denizens of the Plane of Fire and against the [[DATABASE/monster/Shaitan|shaitan]] of the Plane of Earth.
 Of all the elemental lords, Ymeri has the largest following. Some [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Mephit|mephits]] and most [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Elemental, Fire|fire elementals]] revere her, alongside some [[DATABASE/monster/Efreeti|efreet]] and a few other creatures of the Plane of Fire, though few [[DATABASE/monster/Salamander|salamanders]] honor her name, and a covert order of efreeti known as the Secret Fire is dedicated to opposing her rule. On Golarion, the Queen of the Inferno is worshipped primarily by cabals of fire wizards, arsonists, and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Red|red dragons]].
