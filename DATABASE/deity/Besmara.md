# Besmara (The Pirate Queen) [CN]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gods & Magic|Gods & Magic]] 
Once nothing more than a powerful spirit of water with the ability to manipulate sea monsters, Besmara grew slowly in power over the centuries from sacrifices made by seafaring people. After defeating and consuming rival spirits of battle, gold, and wood, she became a minor god of piracy, strife, and sea monsters.
Besmara, the Pirate Queen, cuts a brash and bold figure, as she often is depicted wearing buccaneer apparel consisting of loose-fitting, eye-catching clothing and black boots, and her hair is wind-tossed on even the calmest day. She and her followers adhere to a simple code of greed: take what you desire, no matter who it might belong to. Despite this, Besmara and her worshippers are generally loyal to one another, knowing that while on the waves raiding ships for treasure, a pirate crew can survive only if its members trust one another.

## Divine Intercession

Due to her fiery temperament, the Pirate Queen is quick to punish or reward her followers, and is equally fast at rescinding her favor or forgiving transgressions.

**Minor Boon**: Besmara wants you to amuse her, placing both plunder and peril in your path. This intercession often takes the form of an unexpected treasure map, a message in a bottle, or some other sign leading you to a great reward, assuming you can handle the challenges along the way.
**Moderate Boon**: You are at home on the seas and always ready to plunder an enemy vessel or defend your own. When aboard a boat, you gain a +2 status bonus to all initiative rolls, [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]], and [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]]. In addition, you never get seasick.
**Major Boon**: You seem to be unaffected by storms. You ignore all effects and penalties caused by precipitation and winds, and you can see normally through fog, rain, and other weather conditions.
**Minor Curse**: You feel some of the effects of scurvy, making your wounds flow more easily. The DC of the flat check for you to remove persistent bleed damage is 20 instead of 15 (or 15 instead of 10 if using extremely efficient methods to assist your recovery), and you don’t recover from persistent bleed damage automatically when you reach full Hit Points.
**Moderate Curse**: You get seasick, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 2]] whenever you can see the sea or are on a boat at sea. You can’t reduce this condition until you can no longer see the sea or are off the boat, though you can manage to stomach enough food and water to survive on a voyage, with extreme discomfort.
**Major Curse**: You meet extreme financial ruin for daring to gravely offend the Pirate Queen. Besmara’s agents steal all your booty and bring the spoils to Besmara’s ship, Seawraith. If you want a chance to recover your lost wealth, you must parlay with the goddess and accept whatever dangerous terms she offers, usually requiring a heist she will find sufficiently amusing to watch whether you succeed or fail, and requiring you to trade your spoils from that quest for your previous belongings.
