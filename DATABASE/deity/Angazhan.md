# Angazhan (The Ravenous King) [CE]

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] , [[Gods & Magic]] 
Angazhan is a name well known in the Mwangi Expanse, and for good reason. Called the Ravenous King and Demon Lord of Beasts, he appears as an enormous and terrifying red-furred ape with six long fingers on each hand, massive and clawed. His red eyes, twisted horns, and viciously sharp fangs give him a demonic appearance. His followers range from [[Gnoll]] to [[Charau-ka]] to [[Nalfeshnee (Boar Demon)]] that number in the thousands.
