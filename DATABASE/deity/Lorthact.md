# Lorthact (The Unraveler) [LE]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Shadows at Sundown|Shadows at Sundown]]
Once, Lorthact was a darling of the powers of [[DATABASE/plane/Hell|Hell]], an infernal duke beholden to no single archdevil and rumored to have the favor of the god [[DATABASE/deity/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]] himself. But Lorthact was not satisfied in his station—like so many devils— and concocted a plan to reverse roles with [[DATABASE/deity/Eiseth|Eiseth]], one of Hell's Queens of the Night. Lorthact hoped to gain control of the [[DATABASE/monster/Erinys (Fury Devil)|erinyes]] armies of Hell and a substantial portion of Dis, while Eiseth would take the role of his consort.
 Eiseth uncovered the plot, and Lorthact found himself the target of her legendary fury. His allies and patrons abandoned him, unwilling to bring Eiseth's wrath upon themselves, and Lorthact fled Hell entirely. He leapt from plane to plane, unable to find refuge until at last he slipped Eiseth's pursuit by hiding as a mortal in the city of Korvosa.
Lorthact's cult is incredibly small. Even in his reduced state, he can still grant spells to his few remaining clerics. His symbol is a staff wrapped in scrolls.
