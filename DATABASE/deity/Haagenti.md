# Haagenti (The Whispers Within) [CE]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]
Haagenti plays at seeming reasonable, tempting forbearance with his numerous helpful inventions. Yet, he's just as monstrous as any other demon, only giving his knowledge to those who'll use it to cause horrendous suffering. He claims to have invented the art of fleshwarping, and the many victims of his followers stand as a stunning testament to his true cruelty.
**Category** Demon Lords
**Edicts** practice alchemical transmutations, pursue knowledge whatever the cost, use your inventions to exploit others
**Anathema** aid Yasamoth, allow morality to interfere with research, destroy knowledge
