# Gendowyn (Lady of the Fangwood) [CN]

**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
The fey queen Gendowyn might seem an unusual divine patron for the Knights of Lastwall, but it makes perfect sense to her devotees. Gendowyn is a living manifestation and representation of the natural world, a world in which the undead simply have no place. While her personal morality represents the inscrutable whims and caprices of the First World from which she hails, she recognizes the aligned goals she shares with her knightly followers and bestows her divine blessings upon them in turn.
