# Dranngvit (The Debt Minder) [LN]

**Source** [[Highhelm]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Most dwarves consider the dour goddess Dranngvit to be a necessary evil, a harsh and acrimonious deity to whom one turns only when all other options have been exhausted. Dwarven legend holds that she was once betrothed to [[Torag]] and destined to become queen of the dwarven pantheon, only to be denied her promised throne when Torag fell in love with and chose [[Folgrit]] as his bride instead. Humiliated and embittered, Dranngvit withdrew from Forgeheart, the [[Heaven]] domain of the dwarven gods, to dwell forever in self-imposed exile far from the rest of her pantheon with her great hound Hefnd as her sole companion.
