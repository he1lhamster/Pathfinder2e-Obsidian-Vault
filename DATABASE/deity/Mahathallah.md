# Mahathallah (Dowager of Illusions) [LE]

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]], [[Gods & Magic]] 
Mahathallah was one of [[Pharasma]] servants, the Maiden of Mists, a prophetess who knew the endings of all things—except her own. Tormented by this one gap in her knowledge, Mahathallah first appealed to the Lady of Graves, only to be kindly declined, for to know one's own death is a grievous weight to bear. Driven by her obsession, Mahathallah abandoned her duties and traveled the River of Souls, and thence Pharasma revealed the truth of her death to her. The knowledge broke the Maiden, and she fled. After many ages, she resurfaced in the court of [[Asmodeus]], maiden no more but now the Dowager of Illusions.
