# Laudinmio (The Sovereign of Alchemy) [No Alignment]

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
When Laudinmio began their study of metal in earnest, they found mentors among deities now dead or forgotten—old gods who wished for them to inherit the position of elemental lord. Under this divine pressure and tutelage, Laudinmio rose in prominence as an inquisitive alchemist with millions of projects, endeavors, and discoveries. Once they accepted the mantle, Laudinmio's encouragement of spontaneity and self-expression—be it artistic or scientific—made them a popular ruler famed for administrative flexibility and natural charm. All in their realm, known as the Euphonious Coalition, celebrated metallic crafts, alchemy, and fashion. Laudinmio was keen on being at their most eye-catching and expressive, relying on fashion experts to decide what form, shape, and appearance would complement their attire. As a result, portrayals of the Sovereign of Alchemy have varied greatly over the ages.
