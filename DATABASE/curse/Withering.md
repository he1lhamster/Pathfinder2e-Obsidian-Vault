**Usage** curses a ring, staff, or wand
A _withering_ curse shrivels vulnerable flesh. Whenever you activate the item, one of your fingers turns black and falls off. You take a –1 status penalty to [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] checks and Dexterity-based attack rolls with a hand missing two or three fingers; if you lose more than four fingers on one hand, you can’t use that hand to hold objects or use manipulate actions. These fingers can be replaced by magic but are otherwise gone forever. The GM has the final say on how creatures with unusual appendages or numbers of fingers are affected by this curse.
