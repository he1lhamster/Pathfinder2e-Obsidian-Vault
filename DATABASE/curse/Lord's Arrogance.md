You're filled with the unearned confidence of a young noble and carry yourself as if you can do no wrong.
**Saving Throw** DC 23 Will; **Effect** Whenever you make a [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check or a Perception check that would give you information (such as to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]]), you always receive at least one piece of false information that you believe with absolute confidence, even on a success or better. If you attempt to act on this false information, you receive a –1 circumstance penalty on any skill checks you attempt.
