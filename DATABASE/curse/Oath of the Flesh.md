When you swear an oath, you must obey that oath or suffer terrible consequences.
**Saving Throw** DC 23 Fortitude; **Effect** Each time you make a promise to someone, an ornate symbol representing that promise is magically carved into your flesh. Breaking any of these promises causes the symbol tattoo to grow into a gaping wound, dealing 3d6 slashing damage to you; damage from the curse can’t be healed as long as the curse is still in effect.
