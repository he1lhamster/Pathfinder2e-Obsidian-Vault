Even the most experienced combat veteran becomes as reckless as a rookie when suffering from sellsword’s folly.
**Saving Throw** DC 26 Will; **Effect** The chaos of combat overwhelms you. Each time you roll initiative for a combat encounter, you must attempt a new saving throw against the curse; on a failure, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round. This is an incapacitation effect.
