You grow increasingly glum and stoic, viewing frivolity with disdain and eventually forgetting how to smile or take joy in anything. Over time, you become obsessive about work, toiling away at menial tasks (especially crafting, masonry, or smithing).
**Saving Throw** DC 22 Will; **Effect** Whenever you attempt to [[Earn Income]] or a [[Crafting]] check for any reason, you become obsessed with perfection to the point you hamper your chances of success. Roll the Earn Income or Crafting check twice and take the worst result. If you ever critically fail at a Crafting check or a check to Earn Income, you become [[Fatigued]]. In addition, you suffer a –1 status penalty on all Charisma-based checks as your personality suffers under the effects of this curse. A [[Dwarf]] who dies while under the effects of Droskar's gloom must attempt a DC 5 flat check; on a failure, the dwarf rises as a [[Forge-Spurned]] 1d4 rounds after death occurs.
