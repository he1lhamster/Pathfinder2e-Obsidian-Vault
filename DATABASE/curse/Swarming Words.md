Placed upon those who use magic to cause harm, this curse causes a shower of bugs to fall from your lips whenever you speak, foiling your spellcasting.
**Saving Throw** DC 26 Fortitude; **Effect** The crawling within your mouth never stops as cockroaches, ants, and other insects nest in your body. Whenever you attempt to Cast a Spell with a verbal component or otherwise use an activity that has the auditory trait, you must attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the insects counteract your activity as they crowd your mouth and muffle the sound.

**Tempted Curse** The insects multiply into a cascade. When you activate the tempted curse, you must spend 2 actions to cast a 5th-level [[Vomit Swarm]] to free the vermin inside you. For 1 minute after unleashing the swarm, you are not affected by the curse, but afterward, the swarming worsens. For the rest of the day, whenever you attempt to Cast a Spell with a verbal component or otherwise use an activity that has the auditory trait, you must attempt a DC 10 flat check. On a failure, the insects counteract your activity.
