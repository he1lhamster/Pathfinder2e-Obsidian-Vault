# Cleansing Curse<span class="item-type">Curse 10</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
Your body and mind weaken as you’re increasingly afflicted by the ravages of time, aging at an accelerated pace.
**Saving Throw** DC 27 Fortitude; **Effect** You become [[Clumsy]], [[Drained]], [[Enfeebled]], and [[Stupefied]], each with a value of 1. If you critically fail this saving throw, the value of one of these conditions, chosen at random, is instead 2. If you already have any of these conditions, its value instead increases by the given amount. In time, the cleansing curse will cause your death from old age, but this eventuality takes weeks, or even a month or two—if the PCs haven't defeated the Kingdom of the Cleansed and used the magical pool in area D7 to remove this affliction by the time two months have passed, the GM should decide if some or all of them perish (perhaps by having them attempt daily DC 27 Fortitude saving throws to avoid death after a period of 2 months have passed).
