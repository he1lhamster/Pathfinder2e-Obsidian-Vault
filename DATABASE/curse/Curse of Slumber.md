This legendary curse sends you into a sleep indistinguishable from death.
**Saving Throw** DC 28 Fortitude; **Effect** You fall [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|asleep]] for 1 round (or permanently on a critical failure) and seem to be dead; a creature must succeed at a DC 30 Medicine check to realize you are alive. Noise doesn’t awaken you, but taking damage gives you a new saving throw against the curse.
