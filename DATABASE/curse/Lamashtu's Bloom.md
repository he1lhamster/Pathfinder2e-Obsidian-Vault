While some NPCs become afflicted by Lamashtu’s bloom curse during Parts 1 and 2 of this chapter, during Part 3 the PCs may be exposed to it as well. While the bloom is itself a curse, it functions mechanically more like a disease, and as such features both of these affliction traits. As long as the curse persists, a creature cannot recover from the disease, and removing the curse does not automatically remove the disease element of the affliction. Both elements must be dealt with individually before a victim suffering from Lamashtu’s Bloom is safe. As with all elements of this curse, slaying the bloom of Lamashtu in area C10 automatically removes this affliction.
**Saving Throw** DC 23 Fort; **Effect** **Onset** 1 week; **Stage 1** no ill effects (1 day); **Stage 2** enfeebled 1 (1 day); **Stage 3** enfeebled 1 and 2d6 poison damage (8 hours); **Stage 4** unconscious and 4d6 poison damage (10 minutes); **Stage 5** death; **Special** a creature that dies from Lamashtu's bloom explodes in a blast of First World foliage, releasing a monster. This creature is typically a low-intelligence beast or dragon between 7th and 9th level, depending on the GM's whim.
