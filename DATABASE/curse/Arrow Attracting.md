**Usage** curses armor or shield
An item affected by an _arrow attracting_ curse protects you normally, but it draws ranged attacks like a magnet. Whenever a creature within 120 feet misses with a ranged attack, it must immediately reroll the attack against your AC, affecting you depending on the result of the new attack roll. The _arrow attraction_ curse activates only if you could have been a legitimate target. Creatures that intentionally attempt to miss a ranged attack do not activate an _arrow attraction_ curse. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the item fuses to you.
