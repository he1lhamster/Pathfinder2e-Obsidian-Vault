**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gamemastery Guide|Gamemastery Guide]]
You are haunted by all those you have killed.
**Saving Throw** DC 19 Will; **Effect** You see all creatures around you as those you have slain, still bearing their wounds. You can’t identify, [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about, or otherwise interact with these creatures in any way that involves seeing their true form without first succeeding at a Will save against the curse’s DC to see through the illusion. On a critical failure for such a Will save, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]].
