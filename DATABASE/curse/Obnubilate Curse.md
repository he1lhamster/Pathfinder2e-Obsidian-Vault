Only elves can be afflicted with this magical curse; other creatures are immune. An elf who touches the [[Shadewither Key]] must save against the curse. Victims quickly fall [[Unconscious]]; then, over several days, they slowly blacken and shrivel like rotting fruit until they die. The corpse of an elf killed by the _obnubilate curse_ is dry and charcoal-like; it collapses into ash at the slightest touch.
**Saving Throw** DC 27 Fortitude; **Effect** **Onset** 1 minute; **Stage 1** [[Unconscious]] and 3d6 mental damage (1 day); **Stage 2** unconscious and 6d6 mental damage (2 days); **Stage 3** unconscious and 6d6 mental damage (2 days); **Stage 4** unconscious and 6d6 mental damage, permanent loss of most recent year of memory (1 day); **Stage 5** unconscious and 6d6 mental damage, permanent loss of all memory (1 day); **Stage 6** death.
