It becomes your first instinct to answer every question with an obvious and blatant lie, no matter how trivial
**Saving Throw** DC 31 Will; **Effect** Whenever you're asked a question directly, you must attempt a DC 32 Will save. On a failure, you spout an obvious lie with an automatic failure at your [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check. If you succeed, you can choose your words carefully and answer however you wish, but if you choose to answer truthfully, the agony of telling the truth causes you to take 3d8 mental damage.
