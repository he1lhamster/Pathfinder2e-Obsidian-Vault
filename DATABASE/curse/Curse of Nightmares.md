This curse plagues you with terrible nightmares whenever you sleep, preventing you from resting properly.
**Saving Throw** DC 16 Will; **Effect** You must rest for 12 hours instead of 8 to avoid becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] and can’t gain any benefits from resting or long-term rest. You can still make your daily preparations.
