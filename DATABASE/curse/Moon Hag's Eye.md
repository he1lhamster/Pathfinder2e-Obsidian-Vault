The pupil and iris in your left eye turn yellowish white, pocked with wheat-colored dots like the craters of the moon. This curse enables you to pierce the veil of night, but only at the cost of some of your daylight vision.
**Saving Throw** DC 29 Will; **Effect** You gain low-light vision, or darkvision if you already had low-light vision. In daylight, you take a –1 status penalty to vision-based Perception checks.
