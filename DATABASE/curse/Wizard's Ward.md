A wizard’s ward is placed upon a single book, usually a spellbook. If you damage the book, you must attempt a save against the curse’s effect.
**Saving Throw** DC 22 Will; **Effect** You take 5d6 damage of the same damage type as the damage you dealt to the book, and the damage can’t be healed as long as the curse lasts. [[DATABASE/action/Repair|Repairing]] the book, including replacing any missing text, ends this curse.
