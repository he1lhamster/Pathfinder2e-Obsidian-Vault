**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]
A shriveled, spectral heart appears inside your body, beating alongside your own.
**Saving Throw** DC 25 Will; **Effect** You're harmed by positive energy as if you were undead, harmed by negative energy as if you were living, and can't be healed by either one. All other forms of magical healing, such as the [[DATABASE/spell/Soothe|soothe]] spell, restore only half the normal amount of Hit Points. Alchemical healing, healing with the [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] skill, and other non-magical methods continue to heal you normally.
