**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
A cruel, ghostly voice follows you, whispering your transgressions to anyone you encounter.
**Saving Throw** DC 16 Will; **Effect** Whenever you try to speak to another creature who doesn't know you well, they hear whispers in a language they understand that reveal hints and phrases related to the things about which you feel most guilty. You have a –2 circumstance bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks to [[Make an Impression]] against those creatures, and if you roll a failure on your check, you get a critical failure instead.
