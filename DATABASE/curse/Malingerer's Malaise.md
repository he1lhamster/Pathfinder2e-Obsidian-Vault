**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 194. Cult of the Cave Worm|Pathfinder #194: Cult of the Cave Worm]]
This curse channels [[DATABASE/deity/Droskar|Droskar's]] disdain for anyone who avoids work or can't endure toil, condemning them to forever be tired.
**Saving Throw** DC 26 Will; **Effect** Whenever you rest for 8 hours, you must succeed at a DC 17 flat check or gain no benefits from having rested and become [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]]. If you were already fatigued, you become [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed 1]]. If you critically fail the flat check and were already both fatigued and doomed, increase the value of your doomed condition by 1.
