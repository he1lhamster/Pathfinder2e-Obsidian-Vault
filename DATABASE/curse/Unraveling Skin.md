Often used to protect ancient tomes, this curse causes your skin to shed like weathered paper, cracking and bleeding at the slightest touch.
**Saving Throw** DC 20 Fortitude; **Effect** Seeping wounds cover your body as this curse makes your skin brittle. Any time you would gain the [[Wounded]] condition, increase the value by 1. Any time you take bleed damage, increase the amount of damage by 1.

**Tempted Curse** Your skin falls from your body and exposes your raw flesh beneath, but the curse holds your flesh together as its magic increases. You gain resistance to [[Persistent Damage]] equal to half your level and are [[Doomed]].
