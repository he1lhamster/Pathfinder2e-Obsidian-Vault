**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
Used as a punishment against the vain or the arrogant, this curse slowly transforms you into a frog in not just body, but mind as well.
**Saving Throw** DC 23 Will; **Effect** Your features slowly morph into that of a frog's as you grow a prominent vocal sac. You gain the amphibious trait and can breathe both air and water. You are [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] as long as you are under the effect of this curse, and you can't reduce your stupefied value below 1.

**Tempted Curse** You transform fully, as [[DATABASE/spell/Animal Form|animal form]], giving you the specific abilities of a frog. The duration of this casting is until you make your daily preparations, and you can't Dismiss the spell. While you are under the effect of _animal form_ due to this curse, you have all the usual limitations of _animal form_, including the fact that you can't speak (though you can still understand any languages you know).
