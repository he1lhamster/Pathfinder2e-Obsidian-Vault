**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]
You emit a deathlike stench that attracts swarms of carrion-eating insects.
**Saving Throw** DC 20 Fort; **Effect** You smell like a charnel house, making it easy for creatures with scent to notice you; they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their Perception against you. Additionally, the first time you're exposed to sunlight each day, biting insects attack you, scattering once they've taken damage. You then become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] until the next time you take a full night's rest. These conditions can't be reduced below 1 by other means.
