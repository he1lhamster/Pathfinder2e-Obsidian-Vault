## Traits

**Comfort:**

The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.

## Armor Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.
**Cloth**: 
Clothing isn't armor, but if it has a Dex cap it can accept fundamental and property runes.
