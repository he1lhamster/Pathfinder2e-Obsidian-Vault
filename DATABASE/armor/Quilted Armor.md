Quilted armor is built in a long coat intended for defensive use without other armor. Quilted armor protects the upper body and legs, differentiating it further from the typical padded undercoat. This armor is frequently made in stylish colors or patterns to facilitate use as protective outerwear or a military uniform.

## Traits

**Comfort:**

The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.

## Armor Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.
**Cloth**: 
Clothing isn't armor, but if it has a Dex cap it can accept fundamental and property runes.
