This large, thick cloak is fitted with thin strips of metal at key locations along its length. A pair of straps attaches the cloak to your arms, giving you greater control over the cloak's movements. Using these straps, you can constantly move the cloak or keep it wrapped around yourself to block and intercept attacks. Many Firebrands favor wearing armored cloaks over traditional armor for style reasons, such as matching the cloak to the rest of their outfit.

## Traits

**Comfort:**

The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.

**Flexible:**

The armor is flexible enough that it doesn't hinder most actions. You don't apply its check penalty to [[Acrobatics]] or [[Athletics]] checks.
