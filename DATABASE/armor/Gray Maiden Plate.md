These suits of faceless full plate were first designed and distributed under Queen Ileosa's rule, but today, each new suit of this infamous style of plate armor is made by a Gray Maiden herself or a new member's sponsor.

## Traits

**Bulwark:**

The armor covers you so completely that it provides benefits against some damaging effects. On Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such as a _[[DATABASE/spell/Fireball|fireball]]_, you add a +3 modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

## Armor Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.
**Plate**: The sturdy plate provides no purchase for a cutting edge. You gain resistance to slashing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
