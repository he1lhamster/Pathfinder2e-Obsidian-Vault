Erutaki communities deep in the Crown of the World, where wood is hard to come by, fashion armor from slats and strips of bone or horn, along with whole bones or horns. Wealthier wearers sometimes pay for decorative embellishments made of more precious materials. Niyaháat is usually woven together with strong cord, forming a suit like a breastplate. This suit is worn over heavy clothing or a surcoat like [[DATABASE/armor/Padded Armor|padded armor]]. Some suits incorporate parts of powerful creatures, creating a storied history for the suit and its wearers.

## Traits

**Laminar:**

The armor is made up of layered sections, so when it breaks, it isn't as much of a problem. The status penalty to AC if this armor is [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]] is –1 for broken medium armor, –2 for broken heavy armor, or no penalty for broken light armor.

## Armor Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.
**Skeletal**: Armor made from the bone or exoskeleton of creatures as diverse as bears, insects, and coral, skeletal armor protects vital points from precision damage. You gain resistance to precision damage equal to 3 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 5 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor
