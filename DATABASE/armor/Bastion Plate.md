---
This cumbersome and sturdy plate armor has fluting and additional protection built into the cuirass, helm, pauldrons, and vambraces. Bastion plate was invented for protection in combat tournaments meant to be sporting rather than lethal.

## Traits

**Bulwark:**

The armor covers you so completely that it provides benefits against some damaging effects. On Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such as a _[[DATABASE/spell/Fireball|fireball]]_, you add a +3 modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

**Entrench Melee:**

You can position yourself in the armor or reposition its articulated pieces to better protect against some attacks. If you're trained in this armor, while wearing it you can spend a single action to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against a certain type of attack until the start of your next turn. The entrench trait lists the type of attack this bonus applies against, typically entrench melee or entrench ranged.

**Hindering:**

This armor is so heavy and bulky it slows you down no matter what. You take a –5 penalty to all your Speeds (to a minimum of a 5-foot Speed). This is separate from and in addition to the armor's Speed penalty, and affects you even if your Strength or an ability lets you reduce or ignore the armor's Speed penalty.

## Armor Specialization Effects

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.
**Plate**: The sturdy plate provides no purchase for a cutting edge. You gain resistance to slashing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
