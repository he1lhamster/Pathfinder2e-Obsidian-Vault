# Interrogation

People can't help but trust you, whether through your inherent likableness or your firm insistence on sticking to the truth. You have a way about you that gets others talking, and you've developed interrogative techniques to help you get to the truth of your investigations.
 You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]]. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/No Cause for Alarm|No Cause for Alarm]] skill feat. You can also [[DATABASE/action/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]] over the course of a conversation rather than spending dedicated time looking into the lead, provided the conversation lasts 1 minute or longer. For example, while trying to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], you could pursue the creature you're conversing with as a lead, and you could Pursue a Lead about an object while someone is telling you information about that object. You also gain the Pointed Question action.

You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the right way. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can see and have been conversing with. Attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check against the creature's Will DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
**Critical Success** The target must directly answer your question. It doesn't have to answer truthfully, but you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Perception DC if the creature attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]] to you.
**Success** As critical success, but the circumstance bonus is +2.
**Failure** The target can refuse to answer you as normal.
**Critical Failure** The target can refuse to answer you as normal, and its attitude toward you decreases by one step due to your aggravating attention.
