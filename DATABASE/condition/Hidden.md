# Hidden

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|4.0]]
While you're hidden from a creature, that creature knows the space you're in but can't tell precisely where you are. You typically become hidden by using [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]]. When [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seeking]] a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than [[DATABASE/condition/Observed|observed]]. A creature you're hidden from is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to you, and it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails to affect you. Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.
 A creature might be able to use the Seek action to try to observe you.
