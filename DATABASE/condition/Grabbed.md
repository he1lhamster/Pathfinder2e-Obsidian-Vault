# Grabbed

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|4.0]]
You're held in place by another creature, giving you the [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] conditions. If you attempt a manipulate action while grabbed, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or it is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.
