# Invisible

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]]
While invisible, you can't be seen. You're [[Undetected]] to everyone. Creatures can [[Seek]] to attempt to detect you; if a creature succeeds at its Perception check against your Stealth DC, you become [[Hidden]] to that creature until you [[Sneak]] to become undetected again. If you become invisible while someone can already see you, you start out hidden to the observer (instead of undetected) until you successfully Sneak. You can't become [[Observed]] while invisible except via special abilities or magic.
