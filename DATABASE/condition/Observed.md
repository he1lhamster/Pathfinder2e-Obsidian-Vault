# Observed

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|4.0]]
Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] to [[DATABASE/action/Hide|Hide]], it can become [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] instead of observed. If you have another precise sense instead of or in addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature only with precise senses. When [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seeking]] a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than observed.
