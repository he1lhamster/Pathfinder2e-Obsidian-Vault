# Hostile

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|4.0]]
This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC. A creature that is hostile to a character actively seeks to harm that character. It doesn't necessarily attack, but it won't accept [[DATABASE/action/Request|Requests]] from the character.
