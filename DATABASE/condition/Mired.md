# Mired

**Source** 
The army's movement is severely impaired. It may be bogged down in mud, snow, underbrush, rubble, or similar terrain, encumbered by carrying heavy burdens, or any other reason. Mired always has a value. A mired army takes a circumstance penalty on all maneuvers equal to its mired value and to Deploy Army checks. If an army ever becomes mired 4, it becomes pinned.
