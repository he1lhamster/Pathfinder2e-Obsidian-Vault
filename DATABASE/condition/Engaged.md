# Engaged

**Source** 
An army that is in close combat with one or more enemy armies becomes engaged. An army must be engaged in order to attempt melee Strikes. If an army is engaged and attempts a maneuver war action that would cause it to disengage, it provokes reactions from any enemy armies they were engaged with.
