# Unnoticed

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]]
If you are unnoticed by a creature, that creature has no idea you are present at all. When you're unnoticed, you're also [[Undetected]] by the creature. This condition matters for abilities that can be used only against targets totally unaware of your presence.
