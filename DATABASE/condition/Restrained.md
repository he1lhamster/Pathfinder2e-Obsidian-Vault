# Restrained

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
You're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] conditions, and you can't use any actions with the attack or manipulate traits except to attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] or [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Force Open]] your bonds. Restrained overrides [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]].
