# Efficient

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
The army has performed an Army activity with such speed that it can be used to attempt a second Army activity immediately, but doing so causes it to lose the efficient condition. The second Army activity suffers a –5 penalty on its check, and the result of this second Army activity check cannot grant the efficient condition. If the army doesn't attempt a second Army activity, it instead loses the efficient condition and reduces the value of one condition of its choice by 1.
