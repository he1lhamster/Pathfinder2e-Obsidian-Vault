# Prone

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|4.0]]
You're lying on the ground. You are [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] and take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are [[DATABASE/action/Crawl|Crawl]] and [[DATABASE/action/Stand|Stand]]. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can [[DATABASE/action/Take Cover|Take Cover]] while prone to hunker down and gain greater cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).
 If you would be knocked prone while you're [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climbing]] or [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Flying]], you fall (see Falling for the rules on falling). You can't be knocked prone when [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swimming]].
