# Prone

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]]
You're lying on the ground. You are [[Flat-Footed]] and take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are [[Crawl]] and [[Stand]]. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can [[Take Cover]] while prone to hunker down and gain greater cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).
 If you would be knocked prone while you're [[Climb]] or [[Fly]], you fall (see Falling for the rules on falling). You can't be knocked prone when [[Swim]].
