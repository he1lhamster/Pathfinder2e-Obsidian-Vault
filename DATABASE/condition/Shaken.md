# Shaken

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
The army's morale has begun to falter, be it fear in the face of a powerful enemy, a supernatural effect such as a dragon's frightful presence, or simply the result of ill fortune in the tide of battle. Shaken always has a numerical value. The army's Morale checks take a circumstance penalty equal to its shaken value, and whenever the army takes damage, it must succeed on a DC 11 flat check or its shaken value increases by 1. An army that becomes shaken 4 is automatically routed. An army reduces the value of this condition by 1 each Kingdom turn that passes during which it does not attempt an Army activity or engage in a war encounter.
