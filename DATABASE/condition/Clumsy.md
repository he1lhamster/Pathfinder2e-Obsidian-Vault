# Clumsy

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|4.0]]
Your movements become clumsy and inexact. Clumsy always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Dexterity-based checks and DCs, including AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, and skill checks using [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]], [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]], and [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]].
