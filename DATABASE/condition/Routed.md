# Routed

**Source** 
The army retreats, whether due to magical compulsion or simply broken morale. On its turn, a routed army must use the Retreat war action. While routed, the army takes a –2 circumstance penalty to Morale checks. This condition ends automatically once a war encounter is resolved, but the routed army increases its shaken value by 1 in this case. If all armies on one side of a battle are routed simultaneously, the battle ends and the other army is victorious.
