Your toes are adapted for gripping and climbing. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] feat as a bonus feat, and as long as you aren't wearing footwear, you can use the sticky pads on your feet to climb, leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to climb, you get a critical success instead.
