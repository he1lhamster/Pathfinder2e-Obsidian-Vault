# Elemental Heart Dwarf

Whether through a connection to [[DATABASE/deity/Torag|Torag's]] forge, the [[DATABASE/monster/Azer|azers]] of the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], or another source, you can exude a burst of energy. Mbe'ke and Taralu dwarves of the Mwangi Expanse believe this heritage is a gift from dragons or elemental spirits. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Once chosen, this can't be changed. You gain the Energy Emanation activity.

Energy bursts forth from your body. You deal 1d6 damage of your chosen type to all adjacent creatures (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d6.
