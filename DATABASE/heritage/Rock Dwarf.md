# Rock Dwarf

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Your ancestors lived and worked among the great ancient stones of the mountains or the depths of the earth. This makes you solid as a rock when you plant your feet. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Shove]] or [[Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that attempt to knock you [[Prone]].
 In addition, if any effect would force you to move 10 feet or more, you are moved only half the distance.
