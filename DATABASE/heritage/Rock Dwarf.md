# Rock Dwarf

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Your ancestors lived and worked among the great ancient stones of the mountains or the depths of the earth. This makes you solid as a rock when you plant your feet. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that attempt to knock you [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
 In addition, if any effect would force you to move 10 feet or more, you are moved only half the distance.
