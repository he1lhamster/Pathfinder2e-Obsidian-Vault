# Warmarch Hobgoblin

**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
You come from a line of wandering mercenaries, constantly on the march and scavenging food on the trail. If you fail, but not critically fail, to [[Subsist]] in the wilderness, you can still keep yourself fed with poor meals. When exploring, you can [[Hustle]] twice as long before you have to stop.
