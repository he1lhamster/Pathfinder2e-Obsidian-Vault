Your ancestors were famous trackers, and you carry in your blood that same gift of the hunt. You gain a special sense: imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine the location of a creature, but it remains [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]]. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Track|Track]] creatures that you have previously sensed with your scent.
