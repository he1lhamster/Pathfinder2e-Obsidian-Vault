The undulations of your body's cilia are hyper-attuned to wellsprings of magic; they trill and thrum with insights into occult energies, and their vibrations alert you to the presence of secrets. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]]. If you're trained in Occultism, you instead become trained in another skill of your choice. You also gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Oddity Identification|Oddity Identification]] skill feat.
