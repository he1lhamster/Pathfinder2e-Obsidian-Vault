# Sturdy Skeleton

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
Certain hazardous conditions are not suitable for the average skeleton, so a necromancer might choose to reanimate the bones of a [[DATABASE/ancestry/Dwarf|dwarf]], [[DATABASE/ancestry/Orc|orc]], or other creature with a reputation for sturdiness. You have 10 Hit Points instead of 6 and gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Diehard|Diehard]] feat.
