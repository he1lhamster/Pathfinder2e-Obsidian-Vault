# Sturdy Skeleton

**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
Certain hazardous conditions are not suitable for the average skeleton, so a necromancer might choose to reanimate the bones of a [[Dwarf]], [[Orc]], or other creature with a reputation for sturdiness. You have 10 Hit Points instead of 6 and gain the [[Diehard]] feat.
