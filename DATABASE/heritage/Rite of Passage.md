# Rite of Passage

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] 
Your exoskeleton remains connected with the plants that created it. You can ignore difficult terrain and uneven ground caused by undergrowth. In addition, when you use the [[Acrobatics]] skill to [[Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven ground within forests, you aren't [[Flat-Footed]]. When you roll a success attempting one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.
