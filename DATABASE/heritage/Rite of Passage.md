Your exoskeleton remains connected with the plants that created it. You can ignore difficult terrain and uneven ground caused by undergrowth. In addition, when you use the [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] skill to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven ground within forests, you aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]. When you roll a success attempting one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.
