You effortlessly float on the surface of water. You can walk on the surface of still water and other non-damaging liquids, moving at half your normal Speed. You can attempt to walk along the surface of flowing water as well, still moving at half Speed, but doing so requires a successful [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] using the DC of a [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]] check to move through the water; on a failure, you fall into the water. This Acrobatics check doesn't use an action.
