You are the scion of a vampire, half living and half undead, gifted with uncanny charm and grace, a bloodless pallor, and elongated incisors. You gain the dhampir trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You have the [[Negative Healing]] ability, which means you are harmed by positive damage and healed by negative effects as if you were undead. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can choose from dhampir feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
