# Smokeworker Hobgoblin

**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
Your family have been alchemists, engineers, and scientists for generations, on projects bringing smoke and fire to the field of battle. You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a [[Concealed]] creature if that creature is concealed only by smoke.
