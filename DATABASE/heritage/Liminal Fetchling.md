# Liminal Fetchling

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Ancestry Guide|Ancestry Guide]] 
You come from a line of fetchlings with a closer connection to the [[DATABASE/plane/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]] and [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Planes]], and you share those realms' affinity with the in-between and unseen. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to locate [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] creatures within 60 feet when using the [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] action. Your flat check to target [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] creatures is DC 3 instead of DC 5, and your flat check to target undetected creatures is DC 9 instead of DC 11.
