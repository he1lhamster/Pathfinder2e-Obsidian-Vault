# Liminal Fetchling

**Source** [[Ancestry Guide]] 
You come from a line of fetchlings with a closer connection to the [[Ethereal Plane]] and [[Shadow Plane]], and you share those realms' affinity with the in-between and unseen. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to locate [[Undetected]] creatures within 60 feet when using the [[Seek]] action. Your flat check to target [[Concealed]] creatures is DC 3 instead of DC 5, and your flat check to target undetected creatures is DC 9 instead of DC 11.
