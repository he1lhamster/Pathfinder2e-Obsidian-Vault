You have the features of a bee, butterfly, or other insect that loves sweets. You can ask questions of and receive answers from arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals), as well as use [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on and [[DATABASE/action/Request|Request]] things of them. Most bees, butterflies, moths, and beetles have an indifferent or friendly starting attitude toward you and give you time to make your case, though other arthropods react to you like any other adventurer.
