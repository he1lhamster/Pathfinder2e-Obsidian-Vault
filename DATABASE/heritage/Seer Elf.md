You have an inborn ability to detect and understand magical phenomena. You can cast the [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] cantrip as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
 In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Identify Magic|Identify Magic]] and to [[DATABASE/action/Decipher Writing|Decipher Writing]] of a magical nature. These skill actions typically use the [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/domain/Nature Domain|Nature]], [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] skill.
