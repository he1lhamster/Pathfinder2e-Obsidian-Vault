# Ant Gnoll

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] 
You're a sharp-featured, big-eared gnoll about three feet tall. Many are skeptical that you are in fact a gnoll. Your size is Small instead of Medium. You are trained in [[Deception]] (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to [[Lie]] when specifically claiming innocence, to Deception DCs against [[Sense Motive]] checks to uncover such lies, and to initiative checks when you roll Deception for initiative.
