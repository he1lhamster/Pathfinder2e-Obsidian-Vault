You can flare your neck frill and flex your dorsal spines, [[Demoralize]] your foes. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. You also gain the Threatening Approach action.
