**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You have a powerful tail, likely because you descend from a community of monkey goblins. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], you gain [[DATABASE/feat/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] as a bonus feat, and you reduce the number of free hands required to Climb or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] by one.
