Your predecessors dwelled in the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane's]] deepest, most treacherous regions. You might cast a denser shadow, have a slower pulse, or find comfort in the embrace of darkness. You gain cold or negative resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), chosen when you gain this heritage.
