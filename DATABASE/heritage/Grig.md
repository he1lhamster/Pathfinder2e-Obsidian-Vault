You have the hindquarters of a cricket and adore art and music. Your cricket legs grant you a +2 circumstance bonus on [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] checks to [[DATABASE/action/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[DATABASE/action/Long Jump|Long Jump]], and you gain [[DATABASE/spell/Ghost Sound|ghost sound]] as a primal innate cantrip.
