# Vine Leshy

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
The prehensile vines woven into your body grant you unmatched skill at climbing. You do not need to have any hands free to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]]. Additionally, if you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.
