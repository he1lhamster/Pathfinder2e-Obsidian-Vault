# Witch Gnoll

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] 
You're a shaggy, dark-furred gnoll capable of making some truly uncanny sounds. You can cast the [[Ghost Sound]] cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Impersonate]] and [[Create a Diversion]] when using only your voice.
