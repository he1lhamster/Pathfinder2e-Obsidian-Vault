# Vivacious Gnome

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You have an incredibly strong connection to the positive energy that flows through the [[DATABASE/plane/First World|First World]], making it harder to attack your life force with negative energy. You gain negative resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). When you have the [[DATABASE/condition/Doomed|doomed]] condition, the condition affects you as if its value was 1 lower than it actually is (doomed 1 has no effect, doomed 2 causes you to die at dying 3, and so on).
