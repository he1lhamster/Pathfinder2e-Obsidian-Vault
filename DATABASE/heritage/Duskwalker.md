Thanks to an ancient bargain, your soul has been reborn as a duskwalker, a planar scion with a connection to [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomp]] and the [[DATABASE/plane/Boneyard|Boneyard]]. You gain the duskwalker trait in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. Neither your body nor your spirit can ever become undead. You can choose from duskwalker feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
