# Forge-Blessed Dwarf

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Highhelm|Highhelm]]
PFS NoteYou are from a family in Highhelm that venerates a particular dwarven deity above all others. Your birth was blessed by your family's patron deity, granting you a fraction of their power. Choose one deity from the dwarven pantheon. You can cast the 1st-level spell they grant clerics (such as [[DATABASE/spell/Soothe|soothe]] if your family's patron is [[DATABASE/deity/Bolka|Bolka]]) as an innate divine spell once per week.
