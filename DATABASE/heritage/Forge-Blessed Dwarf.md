# Forge-Blessed Dwarf

**Source** [[Highhelm]]
PFS NoteYou are from a family in Highhelm that venerates a particular dwarven deity above all others. Your birth was blessed by your family's patron deity, granting you a fraction of their power. Choose one deity from the dwarven pantheon. You can cast the 1st-level spell they grant clerics (such as [[Soothe]] if your family's patron is [[Bolka]]) as an innate divine spell once per week.
