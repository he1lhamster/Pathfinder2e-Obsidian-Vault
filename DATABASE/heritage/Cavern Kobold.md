You hatched into a warren among narrow tunnels and countless kin. Your body is flexible. When Climbing rock walls, stalactites, and other natural stone features, you move at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and you move at full Speed on a success if you have [[DATABASE/feat/Quick Climb|Quick Climb]]). This doesn't affect you if you're using a climb Speed. If you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead.
