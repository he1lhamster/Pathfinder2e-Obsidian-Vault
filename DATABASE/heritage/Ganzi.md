Your blood is touched by primal chaos. You gain the ganzi trait in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You gain resistance to a single damage type equal to half your level; at the beginning of each day, determine randomly whether this resistance applies to acid, electricity, or sonic damage. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that would cause you to gain the [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]] condition. You can choose from ganzi feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
