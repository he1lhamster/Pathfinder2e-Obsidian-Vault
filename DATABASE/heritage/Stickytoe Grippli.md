Your hands and feet exude a film that helps them adhere to surfaces. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DC against attempts to [[Disarm]], [[Shove]], or [[Trip]] you. When ascending trees, vines, and other foliage, if you roll a success on the [[Athletics]] check to [[Climb]], you get a critical success instead.
