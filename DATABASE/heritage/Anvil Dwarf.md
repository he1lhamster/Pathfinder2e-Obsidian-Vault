# Anvil Dwarf

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You are a descendant of a famed crafter and have your own amazing talent. Other dwarves might consider this a blessing from your ancestors or from the [[DATABASE/deity/Torag|Forgefather]] himself, depending on where you grew up. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] (or another skill if you were already trained in Crafting) and gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat, but you can pick two different specialties instead of one.
