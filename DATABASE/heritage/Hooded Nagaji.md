# Hooded Nagaji

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]
You bear the hooded head of a spitting cobra, and like such cobras, you can shoot streams of venom from your mouth. You gain a venomous spit ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 10 feet that deals 1d4 poison damage. On a critical hit, the target takes [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent poison damage]] equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Your spit doesn't have a weapon group or a critical specialization effect.
