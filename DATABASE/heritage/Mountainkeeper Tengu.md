You come from a line of tengu ascetics, leaving you with a link to the spirits of the world and the Great Beyond. You can cast the [[DATABASE/spell/Disrupt Undead|disrupt undead]] cantrip as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. Each time you cast a spell from a tengu heritage or ancestry feat, you can decide whether it’s a divine or primal spell.
