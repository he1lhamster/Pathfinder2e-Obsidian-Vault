**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Ancestry Guide|Ancestry Guide]] 
You're the descendant of strix who traveled to the coasts. Your feathers are especially water-repellent and sleekly angled for diving, allowing you to catch fish and other prey in the shallows. You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]], and you gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Underwater Marauder|Underwater Marauder]] skill feat as a bonus skill feat.
