# Impersonator Android

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Ancestry Guide|Ancestry Guide]] 
Your body was augmented with processes and an appearance intended to blend in with humans more easily. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] (or another skill if you're already trained in Deception). You don't require a [[DATABASE/equipment/Disguise Kit|disguise kit]] when attempting Deception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] a [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|human]]. In addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend that you're a human version of yourself, rather than an android. This bonus doesn't apply to other checks to Impersonate humans.
