# Impersonator Android

**Source** [[Ancestry Guide]] 
Your body was augmented with processes and an appearance intended to blend in with humans more easily. You become trained in [[Deception]] (or another skill if you're already trained in Deception). You don't require a [[Disguise Kit]] when attempting Deception checks to [[Impersonate]] a [[Human]]. In addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend that you're a human version of yourself, rather than an android. This bonus doesn't apply to other checks to Impersonate humans.
