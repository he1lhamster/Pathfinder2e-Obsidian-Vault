# Shadow Rat

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Your ancestors lived in dark spaces underground, granting you dark fur and a vaguely unnatural mien that unnerves sapient creatures and frightens animals. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Intimidation]] and can use Intimidation to [[Coerce]] animals. When you [[Demoralize]] an animal, you don’t take a penalty for not sharing a language with it. If you would automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice.
 Animals’ attitudes toward you begin one degree worse than normal, usually starting at [[Unfriendly]] instead of [[Indifferent]] for domesticated animals, and [[Hostile]] instead of unfriendly for wild animals.
