You smell ever so sweet—a delicate, floral scent like the intoxicating fragrance of lilies and the soft scent of lilacs. You're trained in [[Diplomacy]] (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Make an Impression]] if the target can smell your fragrance.
