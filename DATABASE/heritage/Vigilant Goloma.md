# Vigilant Goloma

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/The Mwangi Expanse|The Mwangi Expanse]] 
You've learned to be aware of not just obvious physical dangers, but also noticeable magical threats. You can cast the [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] cantrip as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. In addition, your awareness allows you to notice magical traps easier than others. Your proficiency rank in Perception is considered one step better when attempting to detect magical traps. (Trained is considered expert, expert is considered master, and master is considered legendary).
