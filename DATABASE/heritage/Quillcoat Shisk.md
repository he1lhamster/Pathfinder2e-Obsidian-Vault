# Quillcoat Shisk

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] 
Your body has adapted a defensive mechanism to break off your quills in an attacker, allowing you to defend yourself against aggressive predators, though it takes a while for the quills to grow back. You gain the Barbed Quills reaction.

### [[Barbed Quills]] <span class="action-icon">5</span>

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] 
**Frequency** once per day
**Trigger** You are hit with an unarmed strike or a strike with a non-reach melee weapon.

You break off quills in your attacker's flesh. You deal 1d8 piercing damage to the triggering creature (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.) On a critical failure, the creature also takes 1d4 [[Persistent Damage]] as your quills hook into its flesh. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d8 and the persistent piercing damage increases by 1.
