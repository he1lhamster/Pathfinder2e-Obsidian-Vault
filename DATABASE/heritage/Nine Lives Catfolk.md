# Nine Lives Catfolk

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Your family has always seemed to bounce back from disaster, not through physical hardiness or specialized skill, but from sheer luck. Other catfolk whisper that you have nine lives. If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points by a critical hit on an attack roll, you become [[Dying]] instead of dying 2.
