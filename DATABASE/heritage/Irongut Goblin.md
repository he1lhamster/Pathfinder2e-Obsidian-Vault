# Irongut Goblin

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
You can subsist on food that most folks would consider spoiled. You can keep yourself fed with poor meals in a settlement as long as garbage is readily available, without using the [[DATABASE/action/Subsist|Subsist]] downtime activity. You can eat and drink things when you are [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened]].
 You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against afflictions, against gaining the sickened condition, and to remove the sickened condition. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save affected by this bonus, you get a critical success instead. All these benefits apply only when the affliction or condition resulted from something you ingested.
