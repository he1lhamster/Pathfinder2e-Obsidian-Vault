# Runtboss Hobgoblin

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You come from a long line of hobgoblins who commanded goblins. You are smaller than other hobgoblins, but goblins still listen to any commands you bellow. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Group Coercion|Group Coercion]] skill feat. If you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Coerce|Coerce]] a [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblin]] (but not other creatures with the goblin trait), you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
