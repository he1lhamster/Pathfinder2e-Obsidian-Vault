Your incredibly small bones allow you to easily compress your body and squeeze through gaps. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Quick Squeeze|Quick Squeeze]] feat as a bonus feat, even if you aren't trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]. Tight spaces not tight enough to require the [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeeze]] action aren't difficult terrain for you.
