You live in a vertically-oriented home, and you're a consummate climber. You gain the [[Combat Climber]] skill feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You can use your clawed feet and tail to [[Climb]], leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you succeed at an [[Athletics]] check to Climb, you critically succeed instead.
