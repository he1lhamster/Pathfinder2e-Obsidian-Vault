You live in a vertically-oriented home, and you're a consummate climber. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] skill feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You can use your clawed feet and tail to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]], leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you succeed at an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to Climb, you critically succeed instead.
