# Hunting Catfolk

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You come from a long line of skilled hunters and trackers and have a particularly keen sense of smell. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature's location. The GM will usually double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind.
 In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Track]] a creature or object if you've smelled it before.
