# Sacred Nagaji

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
You stand out from most nagaji, with the upper body of a beautiful human and the lower body of a green or white snake. Legends claim your ancestors were faithful snakes uplifted by [[Nalinivati]] rather than nagaji created by the goddess. Instead of a fangs unarmed attack, you have a tail attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, is in the [[Brawling]] weapon group, and has the finesse and unarmed traits. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Grapple]] or [[Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against effects that would [[Grabbed]] you, [[Restrained]] you, or knock you [[Prone]].
