# Sacred Nagaji

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]
You stand out from most nagaji, with the upper body of a beautiful human and the lower body of a green or white snake. Legends claim your ancestors were faithful snakes uplifted by [[DATABASE/deity/Nalinivati|Nalinivati]] rather than nagaji created by the goddess. Instead of a fangs unarmed attack, you have a tail attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, is in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] weapon group, and has the finesse and unarmed traits. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against effects that would [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grab]] you, [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrain]] you, or knock you [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
