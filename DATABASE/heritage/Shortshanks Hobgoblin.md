# Shortshanks Hobgoblin

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Ancestry Guide|Ancestry Guide]] 
You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins, making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong, muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you in riding and climbing—and you've trained at riding in a saddle from an extremely early age. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Ride|Ride]] feat. Additionally, you are not [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] while you [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]].
