# Rite of Reinforcement

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] 
Your woven exoskeleton rivals the hardest armors that can be found. Your exoskeleton is medium armor in the [[Plate]] armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a speed penalty of –5 feet, and a Strength value of 16, and has the comfort trait. You can never wear other armor or remove your exoskeleton. You can etch armor runes onto your exoskeleton as normal.
