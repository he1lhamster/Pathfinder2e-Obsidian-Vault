# Whisper Elf

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Your ears are finely tuned, able to detect even the slightest whispers of sound. As long as you can hear normally, you can use the [[Seek]] action to sense [[Undetected]] creatures in a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot cone. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action.
