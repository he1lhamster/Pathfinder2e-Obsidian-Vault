# Woodland Elf

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
You're adapted to life in the forest or the deep jungle, and you know how to climb trees and use foliage to your advantage. When [[Climb]] trees, vines, and other foliage, you move at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and you move at full Speed on a success if you have [[Quick Climb]]). This doesn't affect you if you're using a climb Speed.
 You can always use the [[Take Cover]] action when you are within forest terrain to gain cover, even if you're not next to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind.
