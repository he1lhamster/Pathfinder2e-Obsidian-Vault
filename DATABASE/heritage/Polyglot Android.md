You were preprogrammed with a multitude of linguistic proficiencies, likely to act as a translator. You learn two new languages, chosen from common languages and any uncommon languages you have access to. These languages take the same form (signed or spoken) as your other languages. If you select the [[DATABASE/feat/Multilingual|Multilingual]] feat, you learn three new languages instead of two.
