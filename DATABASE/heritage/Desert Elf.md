# Desert Elf

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
You live under the desert's blazing heat, gaining incredible resilience to warm environments. You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), and environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for you (incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat becomes severe, and so on).
