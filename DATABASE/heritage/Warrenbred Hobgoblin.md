# Warrenbred Hobgoblin

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. When you are underground, you can use the [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] action to sense [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] creatures within a 30-foot burst instead of a 15-foot burst. In addition, if you roll a success on an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead.
