# Warrenbred Hobgoblin

**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. When you are underground, you can use the [[Seek]] action to sense [[Undetected]] creatures within a 30-foot burst instead of a 15-foot burst. In addition, if you roll a success on an [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead.
