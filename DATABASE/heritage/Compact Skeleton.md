# Compact Skeleton

**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
For tasks that require a lighter touch, [[Gnome]], [[Goblin]], and [[Halfling]] remains are more suitable than a larger creature's. These smaller, nimbler skeletons fit well in a traveling chest, can be forced through tight spaces, and more easily avoid detection. Your size is Small instead of Medium. You gain the [[Quick Squeeze]] feat, even if you aren't trained in [[Acrobatics]]. Tight spaces not tight enough to require the [[Squeeze]] activity aren't difficult terrain for you.
