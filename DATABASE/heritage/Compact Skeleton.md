# Compact Skeleton

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
For tasks that require a lighter touch, [[DATABASE/ancestry/Gnome|gnome]], [[DATABASE/ancestry/Goblin|goblin]], and [[DATABASE/ancestry/Halfling|halfling]] remains are more suitable than a larger creature's. These smaller, nimbler skeletons fit well in a traveling chest, can be forced through tight spaces, and more easily avoid detection. Your size is Small instead of Medium. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Quick Squeeze|Quick Squeeze]] feat, even if you aren't trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]. Tight spaces not tight enough to require the [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeeze]] activity aren't difficult terrain for you.
