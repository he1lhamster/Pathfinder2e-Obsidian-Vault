# Sweetbreath Gnoll

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/The Mwangi Expanse|The Mwangi Expanse]] 
You're a striped, pale-furred gnoll with oddly pleasant breath, which you can use to entrance your prey. You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] if the target can smell your breath.
