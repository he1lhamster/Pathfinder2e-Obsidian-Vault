# Sweetbreath Gnoll

**Source** [[The Mwangi Expanse]] 
You're a striped, pale-furred gnoll with oddly pleasant breath, which you can use to entrance your prey. You are trained in [[Diplomacy]] (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Make an Impression]] if the target can smell your breath.
