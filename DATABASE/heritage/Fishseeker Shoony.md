You come from a long line of fisherfolk and have inherited the quick reflexes necessary to nab and reel in big game. If you roll a success on an attempt to [[Grab an Edge]], you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. A creature that rolls a failure on a check to [[Disarm]] you gets a critical failure instead.
