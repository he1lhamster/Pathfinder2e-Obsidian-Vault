Whether due to Daikitsu's grace or faithful forebears, you have a strong connection to the divine, affording you certain protections. You gain the Invoke Celestial Privilege reaction. Your alternate form is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up (typically [[DATABASE/ancestry/Human|human]]), called a tailless form.
