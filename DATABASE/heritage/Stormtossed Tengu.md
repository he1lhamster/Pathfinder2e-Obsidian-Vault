# Stormtossed Tengu

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Whether due to a blessing from [[Hei Feng]] or hatching from your egg during a squall, you are resistant to storms. You gain electricity resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the flat check to target a [[Concealed]] creature if that creature is concealed only by rain or fog.
