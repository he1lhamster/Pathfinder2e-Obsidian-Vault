Cannons are perhaps the most well known of all black powder siege weapons, and that's because they represent a good midpoint between power and expense. Keeps and fortresses in Alkenstar prefer to fortify their forces with cannons, as they're relatively easy to construct and their ammunition is cheap enough to build up great supplies.
