This alchemical black powder hybrid siege weapon uses a blast of black powder to spray [[Fire Domain]] from a long metal nozzle, often sculpted or painted with designs resembling a dragon's neck and head. The nozzle turns on a ratcheted, rotating disc with a reservoir in the center to hold a barrel full of combustible alchemical liquid, using black powder to propel the fire. This main structure is atop a wheeled cart to allow it to be easily moved. Unlike most mounted siege weapons, a firedrake is intended to be wheeled out into the thick of a skirmish rather than shooting from a distance.
