A mortar fires its shells at a high angle, allowing it to bypass obstacles and strike from above. A crew typically sets up such a weapon behind a wall or in another hard-to-access area to protect themselves while retaining full functionality. Due to the steep angle of its arc, such mortars are especially useful when opposing barricaded targets.
 **Aim** <span class="action-icon">2</span> 40 feet, minimum distance 50 feet
 **Load** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (manipulate) 3 times
 **Launch** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (manipulate, range increment 100 feet) 5d10 slashing, 20-foot burst, DC 21. Because a mortar launches its round at a high angle, the mortar round descends on the center of the burst from above, not in a straight line from the mortar. This affects whether creatures have cover from the mortar launch.
