A sturdy wooden frame holds the spring-loaded beam that gives this weapon its power. At the end of the beam, a bowl-shaped wooden recession holds the payload, typically heavy stones. The arm is winched back to create torsion, until the release is pulled to abruptly swing the arm forward and fling the payload.
