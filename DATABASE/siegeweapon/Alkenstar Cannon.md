Named for Ancil Alkenstar, this bronze cannon is one of the largest pieces of mobile artillery ever deployed, though its immense weight limits just how mobile it actually is. The barrel of an Alkenstar cannon is nearly 3 feet in diameter, making it impractical to manufacture and handle cannonballs of sufficient size. Instead, Alkenstar cannons spray buckshot in a similar way to [[Blunderbuss]], firing large barrels that break apart mid-flight and release a rain of scattershot over a massive area. The slow movement and short range make this siege weapon fit fewer situations than most, but when used effectively, such as to stop a charge of Mana Waste mutants against the walls of Alkenstar, the results are devastating.
