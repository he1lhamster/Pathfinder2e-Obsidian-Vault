# Dragon Eidolon

<span class="item-trait">Astral</span><span class="item-trait">Dragon</span><span class="item-trait">Eidolon</span>
**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
Because dragons have a strong connection to magic, their minds can often leave an echo floating in the [[Astral Plane]]. Such an entity is extremely powerful but unable to interact with the outside world on its own. Dragon eidolons manifest in the powerful, scaled forms they had in life; most take the form of true dragons (albeit smaller), but some manifest as [[Drake]] or other draconic beings. You have forged a connection with such a dragon eidolon and together, you seek to grow as powerful as an ancient wyrm.

**Eidolon Abilities** _Initial_ breath weapon; _Symbiosis_ draconic frenzy; _Transcendence_ wyrm's breath

## Breath Weapon

Your eidolon has a powerful breath weapon, which they are able to use regularly to wreak havoc upon your foes. They gain the Breath Weapon activity. Choose a damage type from among acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing, or poison, and choose whether the area is a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone. Unless you chose piercing damage, both Breath Weapon and your eidolon gain the trait matching the damage type.

Your eidolon exhales a blast of destructive energy. Your eidolon deals 1d6 damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. The area and damage type of the Breath Weapon are chosen when the eidolon gains this ability. Your eidolon then can't use their Breath Weapon again for the next 1d4 rounds.
 At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6.

## Draconic Frenzy<span class="item-type">7th</span>

Your eidolon can make a furious assault, potentially recovering the use of their Breath Weapon. They gain the Draconic Frenzy activity.

---
Your eidolon makes one Strike with their primary unarmed attack and two Strikes with their secondary unarmed attack (in any order). If any of these attacks critically hits an enemy, your eidolon instantly recovers the use of their Breath Weapon.

## Wyrm's Breath<span class="item-type">17th</span>

Your eidolon can draw upon the power of wyrms to enhance the eidolon's Breath Weapon. Your eidolon gains the Wyrm's Breath free action.

### [[Wyrm's Breath]] <span class="action-icon">4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span><span class="item-trait">Eidolon</span>
**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
**Frequency** once per minute

---
Your eidolon gathers the power of the mightiest wyrms to make its magical breath even more spectacular. If your eidolon's next action is to use Breath Weapon, both the number of damage dice and area of the Breath Weapon are doubled.
