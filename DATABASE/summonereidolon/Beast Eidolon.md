# Beast Eidolon

<span class="item-trait">Beast</span><span class="item-trait">Eidolon</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
Your eidolon is a manifestation of the life force of nature in the form of a powerful magical beast that often has animal features, possibly even several from different species. You might have learned the way to connect with the world's life force via a specific philosophy or practice, such as the beliefs of the god callers of Sarkoris, or formed a bond on your own. Regardless, your link to your eidolon allows you both to grow in power and influence to keep your home safe from those who would despoil it.
