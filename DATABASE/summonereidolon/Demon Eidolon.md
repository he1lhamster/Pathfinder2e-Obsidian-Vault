# Demon Eidolon

## Embodiments of Sin

While all demon eidolons have an associated sin, those sins can be incredibly varied. While many demon summoners conjure up easily recognizable eidolons, such as tempter demons appearing in the form of seductive [[DATABASE/monster/Succubus (Lust Demon)|succubi]] or wrecker demons taking on the form of destructive [[DATABASE/monster/Abrikandilu (Wrecker Demon)|abrikandilus]], other demons may also answer the call, including ones no one has ever seen before on the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]]. A greed-filled summoner might find that their eidolon is in truth one of the fearsome boar demons known as a [[DATABASE/monster/Nalfeshnee (Boar Demon)|nalfeshnee]], while a summoner whose secret sins are stranger and darker than the average person might ever contemplate could conjure up a demonic presence whose appearance has never been recorded in the history of the mortal world.

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
Your eidolon is a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demon]], born of mortal sin congealed amid the chaos and evil of the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]], using its link to you to spread chaos at your side. Choose an associated sin for your demon. Demon eidolons have appearances as varied as the infinite Abyss. While demons are inherently untrustworthy, your demon eidolon has reached an accord with you and generally keeps it, though that doesn't mean your eidolon isn't actively working to bring your life deeper into its associated sin. Though a true demon, your demon eidolon's link to you as a mortal prevents them from casting the [[DATABASE/ritual/Abyssal Pact|abyssal pact]] ritual, even if they somehow learn it.

**Eidolon Abilities** _Initial_ demonic strikes; _Symbiosis_ visions of sin; _Transcendence_ blasphemous decree

## Demonic Strikes

Your eidolon's attacks are corrupted by the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]] and imbued with pure evil and shifting chaos. All your eidolon's unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1 evil damage; as usual, this extra damage harms only good creatures or those with a weakness to evil damage. Additionally, choose one of your eidolon's unarmed attacks that deals physical damage; it gains the versatile trait for a different type of physical damage you choose.

## Visions of Sin<span class="item-type">7th</span>

Your demon is born of sin and can project the sin it is formed from into the minds of others. It gains the Visions of Sin activity

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

---
Your eidolon summons images of its sin into the mind of a target creature within 30 feet, tormenting and confusing the target. The target must attempt a Will save against your spell DC with the following effects. The effects last until the end of your next turn, but your eidolon can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to extend the effects until the end of your next turn (like Sustaining a Spell), to a maximum duration of 1 minute. If the target is evil, it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its save. Regardless of whether it succeeds, the target becomes temporarily immune for 1 day.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target can't use reactions.
**Failure** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] and can't use reactions.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is also [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round. The confusion can't be extended, but the other effects can.

## Blasphemous Decree<span class="item-type">17th</span>

Your demon utters indescribable words writhing with its associated sin. It can cast an evil [[DATABASE/spell/Divine Decree|divine decree]] once per day as a 9th-level spell. You are unaffected by this decree, even if you aren't evil. At 19th level, this becomes a 10th-level _divine decree_ instead.
