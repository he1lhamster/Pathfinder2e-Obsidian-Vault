# Cracked Earth<span class="item-type">Hazard 3</span>

<span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 22 (trained)
**Description** This 20-foot-by-20-foot patch of ground is cobwebbed with cracks and fissures that crumble when a creature steps on it.

---
**Disable** DC 16 [[Survival]] (untrained) to collapse safely; DC 20 [[Crafting]] (trained) to shore it up enough to pass over without collapsing it
**Long Fall** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature steps onto the cracked earth; **Effect** The creature fractures the thin crust of earth and falls through. That creature can use the [[Grab an Edge]] reaction to avoid falling, as long as it is adjacent to an edge. Otherwise it takes falling damage (typically 25 bludgeoning damage for a 50-foot drop). Some of these rifts eventually lead to the Darklands.
