# Benefactor's End<span class="item-type">Hazard 9</span>

<span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 183. Field of Maidens]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 30 (expert)
**Description** A spectral assailant drives a stake into a dying vampire's heart; the vampire collapses and releases a surge of negative energy.

---
**Disable** DC 28 [[Religion]] (expert) to drain away the haunt's negative energy
**Death Throes** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature touches the vampire's corpse; **Effect** A surge of negative energy fills the room as the corpse lurches as though staked. The haunt deals 10d8 negative damage to creatures within 30 feet of the corpse; this damage heals undead creatures for the same amount. Living creatures must attempt a DC 30 Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage and becomes [[Drained]]. This drained condition is reduced by 1 after 10 minutes.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes drained 1.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is drained 2.

**Reset** Unless disabled, the haunt materializes again on the next moonrise.
