**Description** A spectral assailant drives a stake into a dying vampire's heart; the vampire collapses and releases a surge of negative energy.

**Disable** DC 28 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (expert) to drain away the haunt's negative energy
**Death Throes** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature touches the vampire's corpse; **Effect** A surge of negative energy fills the room as the corpse lurches as though staked. The haunt deals 10d8 negative damage to creatures within 30 feet of the corpse; this damage heals undead creatures for the same amount. Living creatures must attempt a DC 30 Will save.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes drained 1.
