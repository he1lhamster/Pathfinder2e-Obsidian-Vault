# Entombed Spirit<span class="item-type">Hazard 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +11 (trained)
**Description** The wall bulges out in the shape of a howling humanoid face as it twists and forms tendrils reaching for nearby creatures. This haunt is formed when a murder victim is entombed within a wall before or after their death.

---
**Disable** DC 17 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (trained) to weaken the spirit, DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] (trained) to force the spirit's face back inside the wall, or DC 19 [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] (trained) to talk down the spirit; two total successes across all skills are required to disable the haunt
**AC** 15, **Fort** +11, **Ref** +5
**Hardness** 9 (wall), **HP** 30 (15); **Immunities** object immunities
**Gasp** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (enchantment, fear, mental, occult) **Trigger** A creature moves adjacent to the wall where the corpse is entombed; **Effect** The spirit gasps and wails for aid while the wall takes on the shape of its face and roils, growing tendrils. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]] for as long as the haunt remains active. The haunt then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** The spirit attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] up to two creatures within 10 feet with a +14 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] modifier, then squeezes each creature it has [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], dealing 1d10+4 damage. The haunt doesn't apply a multiple attack penalty to the second attempt to Grapple.

---
**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all creatures leave the area and resets immediately thereafter. If disabled, the haunt resets after 1 day. The haunt is permanently destroyed if the remains of the deceased are removed from the wall.
