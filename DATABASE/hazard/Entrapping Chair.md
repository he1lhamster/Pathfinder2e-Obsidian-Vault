# Entrapping Chair<span class="item-type">Hazard 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 26 (0 to notice the chair)
**Description** A chair on concealed tracks surges forward, knocking a creature into the chair's seat and trapping them in place with clamping armrests.

---
**Disable** DC 23 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (expert) to disrupt the tracks
**AC** 22, **Fort** +15, **Ref** +9
**Hardness** 14, **HP** 54 (BT 27); **Immunities** object immunities
**Take a Seat!** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature steps on the track; **Effect** The chair rockets forward along the track and slams into the triggering creature, dealing 3d8+15 bludgeoning damage. A creature who succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save takes no damage and moves out of the chair's path into a random adjacent square not containing the track. A creature who fails this saving throw is knocked into the chair's seat and immediately captured by the armrests, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] (restrained on a critical failure; [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC 26).

**Reset** The trap resets automatically over 2 rounds if the chair is unoccupied.
