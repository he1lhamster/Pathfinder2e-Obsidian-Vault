**Complexity** Complex
**Perception** +15
**Description** Narseigus's worm-calling enchantments have attained imperfect control over Zogototaru, compelling her to aid him. She follows his directions loosely and with little finesse.

**Disable** DC 28 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] or DC 28 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (trained) to identify a loophole in mind-controlling magic, DC 30 [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to reason with Zogototaru, or DC 31 [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] to speak as if the PC were Taargick

**Routine** (1 action) Zogototaru acts on Narseigus's most recent command, either Rescuing, Roaring, or Thrashing.
 **Rescue** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (move) Zogototaru lunges near Narseigus, flips him atop her head, and recoils. This moves Narseigus up to 30 feet horizontally and positions him atop Zogototaru, treating her head as a 10-by-10-foot space that's 20 feet above the magma's surface. This movement triggers reactions based on the move trait, targeting Narseigus. Zogototaru continues supporting Narseigus until ordered to perform a different action, after which she deposits him in a safe location within 30 feet as a free action. A PC can [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]] (DC 25 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]]) Zogototaru's coarse hide to reach him.
 **Roar** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (fear, sonic) Zogototaru looms and screeches ferociously. Creatures in a 60-foot cone take 6d6 sonic damage (DC 29 basic Fortitude save) and must attempt a DC 29 Will save. **Critical Success** No effect. **Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]]. **Failure** The creature is frightened 2. **Critical Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] for 1d6 rounds and is frightened 3.
 **Thrash** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (earth, fire) Zogototaru lashes her body, rattling the ground and splashing magma in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 29 Reflex save.
 **Critical Success** No effect. **Success** The creature takes 4d6 fire damage. **Failure** The creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 bludgeoning damage, and is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] for 1 round. **Critical Failure** The creature takes 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 bludgeoning damage, and is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
 **Special** The first time she Thrashes, Zogototaru destroys the pillars in area **F2a**. Anyone there can leap free as part of their Reflex saving throw, landing on the closest surface. For the remainder of combat, the rear half of the crimson worm's body floats in the magma there, creating an improvised bridge 10 feet wide and 30 feet long. Creatures on Zogototaru take a –2 circumstance penalty to their Reflex saves against her Thrashing.
