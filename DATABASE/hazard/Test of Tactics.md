# Test of Tactics<span class="item-type">Hazard 13</span>

<span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 37 (expert)
**Description** Obscure magical runes hidden within the runes of the 16 named warriors bind a pair of derghodaemons into the walls of this hallway.

---
**Disable** Thievery DC 37 (expert) to remove a set of runes linked to one bound derghodaemon, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (7th level, counteract DC 31) to counteract the trap's magic.
**Conjure Daemon** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature moves past the bend in the middle of the hall; **Effect** A pair of derghodaemons rise up from the floor to the north and southeast near the stairs; the daemons roll for initiative using Stealth, and fight to the death but do not pursue foes out of this area.

---
**Reset** If at least one of the derghodaemons survives, the trap resets after 1 hour, causing the surviving derghodaemons to be completely restored to full health and to merge with the floors.
