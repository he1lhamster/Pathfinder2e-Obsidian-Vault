# Precarious Bone Pile<span class="item-type">Hazard 3</span>

<span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 181. Zombie Feast]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 23 (trained)
**Description** This ancient pile of bones appears stable, but the slightest disturbance topples them.

---
**Disable** DC 20 [[Acrobatics]] (trained) or [[Stealth]] (trained) to shimmy past the bones without disturbing them, or deal any amount of damage to trigger the collapse from a distance
**Collapse** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature moves through the treacherous squares near the bone pile or damages the bones piled in one of the squares; **Effect** The bone pile collapses in a torrent of skeletal remains, spreading 5 feet in every direction from the bone pile's current area. This deals 6d4+9 bludgeoning damage to each creature within 5 feet of the bone pile (DC 20 basic Reflex save). The area becomes difficult terrain.
