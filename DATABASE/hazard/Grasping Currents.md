# Grasping Currents<span class="item-type">Hazard 3</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 196. The Summer That Never Was|Pathfinder #196: The Summer That Never Was]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +20 (trained) to notice a weird, faintly glowing ripple of the current beneath the water.
**Description** A swath of drowned spirits tries to pull someone down into the water to join them.

---
**Disable** DC 23 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] to calm the unquiet spirits in the waters for an hour, or light the _Eternal Lantern_ (automatically disables the haunt)
**Ghostly Grasp** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Trigger** A creature attempts to cross the lake by swimming or piloting a boat; **Effect** Ghostly arms reach up to grab and clutch at the creature or the boat, causing a –2 penalty to the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] or Piloting check that triggered the haunt. The haunt then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) On its initiative, the grasping currents attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] a swimming creature or capsize a rowboat by attempting an Athletics check with a +12 modifier. A creature that's [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] by the grasping currents is pulled underwater and risks drowning. To capsize a rowboat, the haunt's Athletics check is rolled against the pilot's Athletics or [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Sailing Lore]] DC, whichever is higher.

---
**Reset** The grasping currents quickly build up power and can trigger again after 10 minutes have passed.
