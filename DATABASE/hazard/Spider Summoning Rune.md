**Description** An invisible rune on the floor summons a [[Goliath Spider]] when disturbed by someone who isn't wearing [[Norgorber]] [[Religious Symbol]].

---
**Disable** DC 34 [[Thievery]] (master) to erase the rune or [[Dispel Magic]] (6th level; counteract DC 36) to dispel the rune.

The goliath spider rolls initiative and remains for 2d6 rounds, after which the spell ends and the spider disappears. The spider also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. Unlike most summoned creatures, the goliath spider can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions.
