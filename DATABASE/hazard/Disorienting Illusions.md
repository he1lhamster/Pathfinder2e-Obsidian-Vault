**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 20
**Description** Illusions cloaking this chamber cause it to appear distorted and constantly shifting, with the room and all its contents appearing tilted, irregular, and in motion.

---
**Disable** DC 17 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] (trained) to calculate the room's dimensions despite the illusions, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (1st level; counteract DC 17) to counteract the illusions
**Disorient** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (arcane, illusion, mental, visual) **Trigger** A creature enters the room; **Effect** Illusions cause the appearance of the room and the objects inside it to constantly warp, shift, bend, and distort for 1 minute. Each creature in the room while it's distorting must attempt a DC 17 Perception check.
**Critical Success** The creature disbelieves the illusions and is unaffected.
**Success** The creature disbelieves the illusions but still sees them. It treats the room as difficult terrain.
**Failure** The creature is fooled by the illusions. It treats the room as difficult terrain and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. As long as it remains in the room, it can't reduce its sickened value below 1.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but each time the creature attempts a move action, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or they lose the action, and on a critical failure, it also falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
