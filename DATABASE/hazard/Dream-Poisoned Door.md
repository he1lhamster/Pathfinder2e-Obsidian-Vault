**Disable** DC 30 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (expert) to concentrate on the eldritch energies and diffuse them through meditation, DC 35 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (master) to scratch warding runes along the door's hinges and block dreams from manifesting, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (6th level; counteract DC 30) to counteract the trap
**Manifest Dream Guardians** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (conjuration, occult) **Trigger** The door is opened; **Effect** A group of four [[DATABASE/monster/Animate Dream|animate dreams]] manifest in the area just beyond the door. These four animate dreams each appear as vaguely whale-shaped but human-sized masses of tendrils. They swim through the air and attack the intruders at once, fighting to the death and pursuing any who flee the temple.
