**Description** A massive storm stirs in the skies above Breachill and Citadel Altaerein. As specific events begin during the three waves of the manifestation's retribution, the dragonstorm wreaks localized havoc.

---
**Disable** The dragonstorm can't be disabled—only endured. It ends only once the attack on Breachill and Citadel Altaerein is over.
**Localized Dragonstorm** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (air) **Trigger** A new wave begins; **Effect** Roll 1d10 to determine which effect manifests from the following possibilities. The placement of these effects is guided by [[DATABASE/deity/Dahak|Dahak's]] will, and they should manifest in the most detrimental locations possible to the PCs.
 
**1–2: Acid Rain** (acid) A torrent of acid drenches creatures in a 20-foot burst. Creatures in the area take 6d10 acid damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). Creatures that critically fail also take 5 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent acid damage]]. 
**3–4: Freezing Wind** (cold) A barrage of freezing wind and hail assaults all creatures in a 20-foot burst. Creatures in the area take 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 bludgeoning damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). Creatures that critically fail are [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round. 
**5–6: Bolts of Lightning** (electricity) Several bolts of lightning strike all creatures in a 20-foot burst. Creatures in the area take 6d10 electricity damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). Creatures that critically fail their saves become [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] for 1 round. 
**7–8: Flaming Vortex** (fire) Gouts of flame fall on all creatures in a 20-foot burst. Creatures in the area take 6d10 fire damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). Creatures that critically fail their saves also take 5 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]].
 **9–10: Poison Miasma** (poison) Poisonous mist rolls forth, covering a 20-foot burst for 1 round. Creatures within the mist become [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]], and creatures outside it become concealed to creatures within it. Creatures within the mist take 6d10 poison damage (DC 42 basic Fortitude save). Creatures that critically fail their saves become [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 2]].
