**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 146. Cult of Cinders|Pathfinder #146: Cult of Cinders]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +0 or [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]]
**Description** A 10-foot-tall wooden pole topped by a wooden carving of [[DATABASE/deity/Dahak|Dahak's]] head. Each dragon pillar's head has been treated with something to give it a distinct color, as indicated in the specific encounter, but regardless of color, plumes of smoke waft up from the mouth.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] DC 26 (expert) to push the pillar over, or [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC 26 (expert) on the pillar to erase the magic runes that power it, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (4th level; counteract DC 22) to dispel the pillar's magic.
**Perception** +16, [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]] 60 feet
**Recognize Ally**; A dragon pillar can see through its empty eye sockets, and it can recognize Cinderclaws and their allies. A character disguised as a Cinderclaw can trick a dragon pillar into perceiving it as a Cinderclaw ally by using [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] to [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]]. A dragon pillar always uses Perception for initiative.
**AC** 24, **Fort** +17, **Ref** +8
**Hardness** 14, **HP** 56 (BT 28); **Immunities** critical hits, fire, object immunities, precision damage
**Dragon Pillar Glance** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The dragon pillar sees a creature within 120 feet who isn't a recognized Cinderclaw or Cinderclaw ally. **Effect** The dragon pillar makes an eye beam Strike against the triggering creature, then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) On its initiative, the dragon pillar fires an eye beam at the closest target within 120 feet.
 **Ranged** <span class="action-icon">1</span> eye beam +20 (divine, evocation, range 120 feet), **Effect** The target is subjected to an effect determined by the pillar's color and summarized below. On a critical hit, the target's save result is one degree worse.

* **Black Eye Beam (area A5)** (incapacitation) DC 24 Fortitude save. **Critical Success** The target is unaffected. **Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round. **Failure** The target is blinded for 1 hour. **Critical Failure** The target is blinded for 24 hours.
* **Blue Eye Beam (area A7)** (incapacitation) DC 24 Fortitude save. **Critical Success** The target is unaffected. **Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Petrified|petrified]] for 1 round. **Failure** The target is petrified for 1 hour. **Critical Failure** The target is petrified permanently.
* **Green Eye Beam (area A8)** (poison) 6d6 poison damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).
* **Indigo Eye Beam (area A9)** (incapacitation) DC 24 Will save. **Critical Success** The target is unaffected. **Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round. **Failure** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round. **Critical Failure** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controlled]] by the dragon pillar and remains within 60 feet of it at all times, defending the dragon pillar from all non-Cinderclaws. While a target is controlled, it is treated as a Cinderclaw ally by the dragon pillar. The dragon pillar can control up to 3 targets at a time; any targets in excess who critically fail this saving throw are instead confused for 1d4+1 rounds. A controlled creature can attempt a new Will save once every 24 hours to escape control, but doing so automatically causes the dragon pillar to attack it with a new eye beam to attempt to re-establish control. The control ends if the pillar is destroyed.
* **Yellow Eye Beam (area A12)** (electricity) 6d6 electricity damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).
* **Orange Eye Beam (area A15)** (acid) 6d6 acid damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).
* **Red Eye Beam (area A16)** (fire) 6d6 fire damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).
* **Violet Eye Beam (area B11)** (incapacitation) DC 24 Will save. **Critical Success** The target is unaffected. **Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]]. **Failure** The target is stunned 3. **Critical Failure** The target is stunned 7.

**Reset** The dragon pillar deactivates and resets as soon as it perceives no appropriate targets in range.
