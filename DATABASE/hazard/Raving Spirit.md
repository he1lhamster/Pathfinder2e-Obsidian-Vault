# Raving Spirit<span class="item-type">Hazard 11</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 153. Life's Long Shadows]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +20 (expert) or DC 30 (master) to detect the spiritual nexus
**Description** The restless spirit of Currew raves against his tormentors when someone enters his room.

---
**Disable** DC 30 [[Intimidation]] (expert) to quiet the spirit for 1 round, or DC 32 [[Religion]] (master) to exorcise it
**Raving Diatribe** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (death, emotion, fear, illusion, mental, occult) **Trigger** A creature remains in area B3 for longer than 1 round; **Effect** Each creature in the sealed room is targeted by [[Nightmare]] (DC 30 Will save). The haunt counts as having met the targets. It then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (2 actions) The haunts casts [[Phantasmal Killer]] (DC 30 Will save) on a random creature who can see Currew's bed (it can even target creatures outside of area B3, so long as the target can see the bed). Everyone affected by the _phantasmal killer_ sees the same image: a sickly old man lies in the bed, screaming and ranting about his guilt, shame, and eventual death.

---
**Reset** The haunt grows quiet and resets 1 minute after no creatures are in area B3.
