**Stealth** DC 40 (master)
**Description** The room fills with swirling vortexes of freezing wind that swiftly freeze flesh and chill the bones.

**Disable** DC 33 (master) to adjust the wheel's mechanisms so that it won't trigger the Test of Endurance, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (7th level, counteract DC 31) to counteract the trap's magic.
**Freezing Wind** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (cold, [[DATABASE/equipment/Cat|evocation]]) **Trigger** A creature critically fails at an attempt to Rotate the Wheel or releases their grip on the wheel once they've started to rotate it; **Effect** A vortex of freezing wind howls through the room—all creatures in the room must attempt a DC 33 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.
**Success** The creature takes 1d6 cold damage for each revolution the wheel has been rotated (max 7d6).
**Failure** The creature takes 2d6 cold damage for each revolution the wheel has been rotated (max 14d6) and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 3d6 cold damage for each revolution the wheel has been rotated (max 21d6), becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]] 1, and becomes fatigued.
