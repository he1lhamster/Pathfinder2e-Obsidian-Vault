# Banshee's Symphony<span class="item-type">Hazard 18</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +30 (legendary)
**Description** A magically contagious wail of the banshee spell is trapped in the larynx of an invisible, mummified elf.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC 42 (master) to pierce the invisible larynx so precisely that the magic releases in a trickle before the trap activates, Thievery DC 44 (legendary) three times to deconstruct the larynx while the trap is active in such a way that it tears the spell apart, or spell DC 38 (9th level) to counteract the [[DATABASE/spell/Wail of the Banshee|wail of the banshee]] before the trap activates
**Scream** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Three or more living creatures remain within 100 feet of the trap for 6 seconds or longer. **Effect** The trap releases an arcane wail of the banshee (DC 40) with a 100-foot-radius emanation instead of 40 feet, targeting all living creatures in the area, and rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) The trap uses its action to force one random creature that failed its save against _wail of the banshee_ last turn to emit a _wail of the banshee_ with the same statistics as the initial one. The creature wails even if it is dead or unable to speak, no matter how far away from the trap it is. Unlike a casting of the spell, the drained condition from this trap’s _wail of the banshee_ spells increases the targets’ drained condition values. A creature that critically succeeds at any of its saves can still be affected by the trap on future rounds, but can’t be forced to wail by the trap.

---
**Reset** The trap ends when the trap is unable to make a creature scream (usually because no creature failed its save on the previous turn or because all creatures have critically succeeded in the past). It then resets over 24 hours, as a new scream builds up in the mummified larynx.
