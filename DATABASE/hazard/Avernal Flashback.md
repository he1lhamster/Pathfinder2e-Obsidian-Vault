**Routine** (2 actions) Zogototaru uses 1 action to create a Tremor. With her other action, she either Exudes Heat or makes Rocks Fall, alternating between the two each round.
 **Exude Heat** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Zogototaru breathes fire across Guldrege. Even from a distance, this makes the area blisteringly hot, dealing 3d6 fire damage to all creatures (DC 22 basic Fortitude save).
 **Rocks Fall** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Zogototaru's thrashing appears to crack the roof, dropping debris on a random creature in the area. This deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save).
 **Tremor** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Zogototaru's thrashing shakes the ground, knocking creatures [[Prone]] in the area unless they succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save.
