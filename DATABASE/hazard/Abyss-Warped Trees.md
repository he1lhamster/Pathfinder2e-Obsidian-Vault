# Abyss-Warped Trees<span class="item-type">Hazard 4</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 176. Lost Mammoth Valley|Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** DC 12 (Trained) to determine the trees can move
**Description** A forest of fiendish trees swing their branches and shift their roots to bludgeon and trip creatures in the tainted grove (area A21).

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] (trained) to find a location the trees can't reach or DC 24 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] to recite a prayer that temporarily casts out the fiendish energy inside a single tree in the grove, disabling it for 1 minute. A disabled or destroyed tree creates a 5-foot-square area in the grove that's safe from this hazard.
**AC** 18, **Fort** +14, **Ref** +14
**Hardness** 10, **HP** 40 (BT 20); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage, **Weaknesses** fire 5
**Shift Roots** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature ends its movement in the grove; **Effect** The trees throughout the tainted grove shift their roots wildly, making the area difficult terrain, then the Abyss-warped trees roll initiative.
**Tighten Grip** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Trigger** The Abyss-warped trees critically hit a creature with a branch Strike; **Effect** The Abyss-warped trees loop their branches around the triggering creature, [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbing]] it ([[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC 21).

---
**Routine** (4 actions) The Abyss-warped trees use their first action each round to lash their roots; each creature in the tainted grove must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or fall [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. The Abyss-warped trees use their second, third, and fourth actions to make branch Strikes against up to three different creatures in the tainted grove. 
**Melee** branch +14, **Damage** 2d8+5 bludgeoning

---
**Reset** The Abyss-warped trees cease moving 1 minute after no living creatures are in the tainted grove. They reset immediately. A disabled tree reanimates after 1 minute. A destroyed tree regrows after 1 month.
