**Source** [[Pathfinder 186. Ghost King's Rage]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +42 (master)
**Description** A time rift focused on the sundial causes time to pass erratically for all creatures in the area.

---
**Disable** Three DC 48 [[Thievery]] (legendary) or DC 48 [[Occultism]] (master) checks to mend the time rift.
**Pause** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (incapacitation) **Trigger** A creature enters the area; **Effect** The triggering creature becomes temporarily unmoored from time, becoming [[Stunned]]. If the creature succeeds at a DC 47 Will save, they reduce this to stunned 1. The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) On its initiative, the time rift alters each creature's timeline. Each creature in the area rolls a 1d4 to randomly determine the effect on them.

1. The creature becomes [[Slowed]] for 1 round.
2. The creature is unaffected.
3. The creature is affected erratically by time; they're concealed for 1 round.
4. The creature becomes [[Quickened]] for 1 round
