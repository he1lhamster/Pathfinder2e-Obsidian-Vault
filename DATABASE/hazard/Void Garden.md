# Void Garden<span class="item-type">Hazard 14</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 184. The Ghouls Hunger]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +28 (master)
**Description** Six eerie purple crystals react to the presence of life, pulsing with flashes of violet light that seem to match the heartbeats of living creatures in the room.

---
**Disable** DC 33 **Thievery** (master) or DC 35 [[Nature]] (master) to discern a hairline fracture that, when struck, shatters a crystal to dust
**AC** 36, **Fort** +28, **Ref** +22
**Crystal Hardness** 22, **Crystal HP** 92 (BT 46); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities (except positive), precision damage, **Weaknesses** positive 15
**Negative Energy Pulse** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (attack) **Trigger** A living creature enters the circular portion of area D4, or a crystal takes damage from any source; **Effect** The void garden creates a pulse of negative energy that fills the entire room and, if the doors to area D3 are open, extends 30 feet into the hallway beyond. All living creatures in this area must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save. The trap then rolls initiative.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected
**Success** The creature takes 5d6 negative damage.
**Failure** The creature takes 8d6 negative damage and is [[Drained]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 16d6 negative damage and is drained 2.

---
**Routine** (6 actions) The void garden's crystals each use an action to fire a void ray, a beam of destructive dark purple energy, at a random living creature in the room or in visible reach through the open doorway (the crystals don't fire at living targets on the balcony in area D6c). A single creature can be targeted only once per round by a void ray. The void garden loses one action for each crystal that is disarmed or destroyed.
 **Ranged** <span class="action-icon">1</span> void ray +29 (negative, range 120 feet), **Damage** 3d10 negative plus [[Drained]] (this drained value stacks with that caused by other void rays or the hazard's Negative Energy Pulse, to a maximum of drained 5).

**Reset** The void garden deactivates 1 round after all living targets leave the area but resets immediately thereafter.
