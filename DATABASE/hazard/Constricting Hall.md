# Constricting Hall<span class="item-type">Hazard 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** DC 31
**Description** A hall's four walls become fluid and elastic when a creature reaches the hall's midpoint.

---
**Disable** DC 28 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to stabilize each wall, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (4th level; counteract DC 26) to counteract each wall
**Lose Form** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (occult, transmutation) **Trigger** A creature reaches the hall's midpoint; **Effect** The hall's walls lose their rigidity, becoming fluid and elastic. The hall becomes difficult terrain, and each creature in the hall is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] unless they succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save. The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (4 actions) This trap loses 1 action each round for each wall that has been disabled. Each wall uses 1 action to slam back and forth rapidly, pummeling one creature in the hall with a wall Strike. On a hit, the target is additionally knocked prone. The walls distribute the attacks as evenly as possible among creatures in the hall, and the Strikes don't apply the trap's multiple attack penalty.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> wall +20, **Damage** 2d10+11 bludgeoning
