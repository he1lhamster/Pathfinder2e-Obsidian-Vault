**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rusthenge|Rusthenge]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +8 (trained)
**Description** A complex device made of multicolored metal that resembles a combination of grinding gears, spider-like legs, and twitching blades, from which emits a constant soft ticking sound. All of the metal in the device appears to be rusted or corroded.

---
**Disable** DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] to adjust the device's workings so they seize up and no longer function, or DC 21 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] to focus prayers to a non-evil deity into the device to disrupt its ability to channel ambient faith
**AC** 18, **Fort** +5, **Ref** +11
**Hardness** 8, **HP** 30 (BT 15); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Spin Up** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The ancient apparatus takes damage or an attempt to disable it fails; **Effect** The ancient apparatus begins to grind and churn faster. Its soft ticking whirs up to a discordant buzzing sound, and the entire thing begins to glow with an unsettling rust-colored light. All living creatures in area **D3** experience the unsettling taste of rust in their mouths and must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save to avoid becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]]. The ancient apparatus then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) The ancient apparatus emits beams of rust-colored light, spending an action to make ranged Strikes against three targets in area D3. The apparatus can target creatures as if it possessed [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]], but has no ability to discern between friend or foe. It can't target a creature more than once, and if there are more than three targets, it selects its targets from those it can see in the room randomly. The ancient apparatus has only 1 action as long as its Hit Points are below its BT.
 **Ranged** rusty light beam +11 (divine, necromancy), **Damage** 2d6+5 negative plus [[DATABASE/disease/Rust Creep|rust creep]]

---
**Reset** The ancient apparatus reverts to its non-active mode and resets automatically at the end of any round in which there are no obvious targets to attack.
