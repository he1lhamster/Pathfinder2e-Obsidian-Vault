**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +20 (expert) or DC 30 (expert) to notice the three launching mechanisms built into the wall

---
**Disable** DC 32 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (master) to sufficiently jam the tubes to make the trap unable to attack creatures in a single 5-foot square in the room, or DC 34 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] (master) to alter one of the three launching mechanisms
**AC** 31, **Fort** +24, **Ref** +15
