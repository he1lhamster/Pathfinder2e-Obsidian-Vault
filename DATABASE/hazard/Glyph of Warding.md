**Source** [[Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 34 (trained)
**Description** An hourglass-shaped glyph flashes with mauve light, then seems to quickly drain its sand away, as if to indicate time has suddenly run out.

---
**Disable** DC 34 [[Thievery]] (trained) to remove the glyph without triggering it, or [[Dispel Magic]] (7th level, counteract DC 34) to counteract the glyph.
**Release Spell** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature attempting to open the desk drawer or the secret door to area D6 triggers the associated glyph; **Effect** The glyph of warding targets the creature with a [[Spirit Blast]] (save DC 34).
