# Unsafe Stairs<span class="item-type">Hazard 0</span>

<span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Crown of the Kobold King|Crown of the Kobold King]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 16
**Description** The rickety stairs groan and strain alarmingly if a Small or larger creature ascends them.

---
**Disable** DC 16 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] to quickly jury-rig some supports to prevent the stairs from collapsing
**Collapse** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A Small or larger creature attempts to climb the stairs; **Effect** The stairs attempt a DC 8 flat check (if a Small creature triggered the hazard) or a DC 16 flat check (if a Medium or multiple Small creatures triggered it). On a failure, the stairs collapse. All creatures on the stairs fall and take 2d6+3 bludgeoning damage from the collapsing rubble (DC 16 basic Reflex save).
