**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 146. Cult of Cinders|Pathfinder #146: Cult of Cinders]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +16 (expert)
**Description** Blasts of fire and smoke pour out of the tunnel walls to coalesce into the burning form of [[DATABASE/deity/Dahak|Dahak]] himself; a PC who succeeds at a DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] notes that the fiery dragon closely resembles classical depictions of the draconic god of destruction.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] DC 26 (expert) to utter prayers to a nonevil deity to counteract Dahak's presence (prayers to [[DATABASE/deity/Apsu|Apsu]] allow this check to be made if the character is merely trained in Religion), [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC 30 (expert) to divert the hazard's energies back upon themselves, or a successful [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (4th level; counteract DC 26).
**AC** 27, **Fort** +17, **Ref** +13
**HP** 130; **Immunities** critical hits, fire, object immunities, precision damage, **Weaknesses** cold 10
**Manifest** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature is within the way station. **Effect** The vision of Dahak appears in a 15-foot space adjacent to that creature and rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (2 actions) The vision of Dahak manifests next to the creature that is closest to the center of the way station, then uses its Breath Weapon in a direction that catches the most possible targets in its area.
 **Breath Weapon** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (divine, evocation, [[DATABASE/domain/Fire Domain|fire]]) The vision of Dahak unleashes a blast of fire from its burning maw, creating a 60-foot cone that deals 6d6 fire damage to all creatures within (DC 26 basic Reflex save).

---
**Reset** The vision of Dahak deactivates and resets automatically once no creatures remain within the Huntergate way station.
