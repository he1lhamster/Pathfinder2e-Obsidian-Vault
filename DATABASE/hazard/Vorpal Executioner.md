# Vorpal Executioner<span class="item-type">Hazard 19</span>

<span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 43 (expert)
**Description** A wickedly sharp saw blade descends and travels along grooves in a complex path throughout the room, attempting to decapitate everyone within.

---
**Disable** [[Thievery]] DC 41 (expert) at four different junctions to jam all the saw blade’s possible paths, preventing it from traveling through the room
**AC** 43, **Fort** +32, **Ref** +32
**Hardness** 30, **HP** 120 (60) per junction; **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Total Decapitation** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature attempts to exit the room. **Effect** The saw blade travels along its path, making one Strike against each creature in the room, twisting and varying its height for a maximum chance of beheading its targets.
 **Melee** saw blade +40 (deadly d12, death), **Damage** 6d12+25 slashing plus decapitation; no multiple attack penalty
 **Decapitation** On a critical hit, a target must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude save or be decapitated, dying instantly unless it can survive without a head.
