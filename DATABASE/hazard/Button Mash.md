**Source** [[Pathfinder 186. Ghost King's Rage]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +24 (master)
**Description** The room floods with harmful effects by pressing a magic sigil on a console. Each sigil causes different results. There are six sigils on the console.

---
**Disable** DC 40 [[Arcana]] (master) to disenchant each sigil (can be done from either side of the reception desk), DC 43 [[Thievery]] (master) twice to disable the console (can only be done while behind the reception desk), or [[Dispel Magic]] (8th level; counteract DC 40) to counteract each sigil; prevent Noph from pressing the buttons by gaining access to the reception desk or other methods
**AC** 40, **Fort** +32, **Ref** +26
**Console Hardness** 28, **Console HP** 110 (BT 55); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Lockdown** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (abjuration, force) **Trigger** Noph or another creature arms the trap by pressing a sigil on the console; **Effect** A barrier of force forms from floor to ceiling surrounding the reception desk. The DC to counteract this barrier with dispel magic is 43. The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (2 actions) Noph frantically pecks and stomps on the console, using each action to press a random sigil. Roll 1d6 to determine which sigil Noph presses. Psychopomps are immune to the effects of these sigils.

1. The area is flooded with holy light, dealing 3d12+19 positive damage to each creature in the area (DC 43 basic Reflex save).
2. The area is flooded with unholy darkness, dealing 3d12+19 negative damage to each creature in the area (DC 43 basic Reflex save).
3. The area is flooded with blue flames, dealing 3d10+19 fire damage to each creature in the area (DC 43 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature additionally takes 1d10 [[Persistent Damage]].
4. A comet streaks through the area, attacking the nearest creature to Noph with a comet Strike.
5. Force tethers sprout from the floor, grasping at intruders. Each creature in the area is [[Immobilized]] for 1 round unless they succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save.
6. Ghostly blue mist surrounds each [[Psychopomp]] in the area, healing them 3d8+19 HP and granting them [[Concealed]] for 1 round.
