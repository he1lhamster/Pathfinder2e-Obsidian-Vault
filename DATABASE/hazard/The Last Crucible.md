# The Last Crucible<span class="item-type">Hazard 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Crown of the Kobold King|Crown of the Kobold King]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +15 (expert)
**Description** Magically hardened sheets of obsidian drop down over the room's exits while the machinery within taps into wells of magma to begin spewing lava—and monsters—into the maze.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC 28 (expert) to disable the main pressure plate at area H4a and deactivate the trap entirely (this causes the obsidian walls to retract up into the ceiling as well), Thievery DC 25 (trained) to disable one of the three lava spouts, or [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] DC 28 (trained) to [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Force Open]] a fallen obsidian wall
**AC** 22, **Fort** +17, **Ref** +11
**Obsidian Wall Hardness** 15, **Obsidian Wall HP** 58 (BT 29) to smash a 5-foot-square hole in the wall; **Spout Hardness** 13; **Spout HP** 20 (BT 10); **Immunities** critical hits, fire, object immunities, precision damage
**Drop the Wall** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Four or more Small or larger creatures walk onto the pressure plate at area H4a; **Effect** A magically hardened sheet of obsidian drops down like a portcullis in the western and northern entrances to this room that lead to areas H3 and H5, respectively. Any creatures standing in one of these squares takes 4d6+4 bludgeoning damage from the falling wall (DC 24 basic Reflex save) and then decides what side of the wall they want to be on. At the same moment, four [[DATABASE/monster/Thoqqua|thoqquas]] that have spent centuries in hibernation awaken and emerge from vents into area H4b. The trap then rolls initiative, as do the thoqquas.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled spout each turn. On each action, a different spout located at one of the three areas marked H4c spews a gout of lava at the closest non-thoqqua target in its line of sight; these spouts use magical sensors that have [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]] and a Perception DC of 25. Originally, agents of the abbot would come through here after the trap was triggered, deactivate it, and clean out the hardened blobs of lava and dead bodies that remained, but the amount of time it would take for this trap to clog tunnels with cooled lava makes tracking that slow accretion over the course of this adventure unnecessary.
 **Ranged** <span class="action-icon">1</span> lava gout +17 (fire), **Damage** 4d8 fire; no multiple attack penalty

---
**Reset** The Last Crucible deactivates and resets 10 minutes after it has no target creatures (because the creatures either left area H4 or died). Any thoqquas that still live sense the magma river at area H6 and eventually make their way north to that area to swim away.
