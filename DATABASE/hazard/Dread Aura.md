# Dread Aura<span class="item-type">Hazard 16</span>

<span class="item-trait">Environmental</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 42 (master)
**Description** The disturbing sensation of being watched, of having attracted the unwanted attention of something unimaginably powerful, or knowing the eerie conviction that unseen stars in the sky above might be looking down upon this spot grows increasingly overwhelming.

---
**Disable** DC 45 Occultism (master) to inscribe eldritch warding sigils on the stones of the tower (this is an activity that takes 1 hour to perform) or defeat the Thresholder influence in the chambers below (as detailed in Chapter 9)
**Unsettling Attention** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, occult) **Trigger** A creature ends its turn within the ruins of the tower or the chambers below while not currently being affected by the Dread Aura; **Effect** The creature feels as if its presence in the area has attracted the attention of something powerful and must attempt a DC 37 Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is immune to the Dread Aura forever.
**Success** The creature is unaffected and is immune to the Dread Aura for 24 hours.
**Failure** The creature becomes unsettled and suffers a –2 penalty to all saves against fear effects as long as they remain within the hex containing Candlemere.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but each time the creature becomes frightened or flees, the fear is physically enervating, and the creature is also [[Enfeebled]] 1 as long as they remain [[Frightened]] or [[Fleeing]].
