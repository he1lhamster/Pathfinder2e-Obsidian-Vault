# Obscured Pitfalls<span class="item-type">Hazard 2</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Crown of the Kobold King]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 18 (or 0 if the eyes covering an area that obscures a pitfall are destroyed)
**Description** A layer of disembodied eyes obscures a pitfall in the floor that's either deep enough for a human to fall into, or narrow enough to cause a painful fall.

---
**Disable** This hazard can't be disabled, merely avoided.
**Pitfall** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature walks into a large pit's square; **Effect** The triggering creature falls into the pit but can attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to [[Grab an Edge]] to avoid falling. On a failure, a creature falls 20 feet into an eye-filled pit. The eyes cushion the fall so the 20-foot fall inflicts only 5 bludgeoning damage, but they also completely obscure vision; a character is effectively [[Blinded]] as long as they remain in the pit. The walls of the pit are slick, though a character can Climb them with a successful DC 25 Athletics check.
 **Trip** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature walks into a small pit's square; **Effect** The triggering creature must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or fall [[Prone]] (on a critical failure, the creature also twists its ankle and becomes [[Clumsy]] until it receives any amount of healing).
