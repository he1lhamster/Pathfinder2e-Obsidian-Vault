**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rusthenge|Rusthenge]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 18 (trained)
**Description** A piece of hide covered with a layer of dirt and gravel is suspended over a 20-foot pit filled with spikes.

---
**Disable** DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to manually trigger the trap without falling in, or DC 25 Thievery (trained) to secure the hide so the trap doesn't activate

A falling creature can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] with a DC 20 Reflex save (this becomes a DC 22 Reflex save if rushing waters are pouring into the pit). **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> spike +14, **Damage** 4d8 piercing
