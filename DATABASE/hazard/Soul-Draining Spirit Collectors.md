---
**Disable** DC 47 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (legendary) to sever the connection between [[DATABASE/deity/Urgathoa|Urgathoa]] and each spirit collector, DC 50 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (legendary) to deactivate each spirit collector, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (9th level; counteract DC 50) to counteract each spirit collector
**AC** 43, **Fort** +35, **Ref** +29
**Hardness** 33, **HP** 130 (BT 65); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Repulse** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, [[DATABASE/equipment/Cat|evocation]], force) **Trigger** A creature damages a spirit collector; **Effect** The damaged spirit collector releases a wave of force to repel the triggering creature, dealing 4d10+20 force damage to the triggering creature, who must attempt a Reflex save. The trap then rolls initiative.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage and is pushed back 5 feet.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and lands [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is pushed back 20 feet, and lands prone.

**Routine** (4 actions) This trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled spirit collector. Each spirit collector uses 1 action to drain the souls of all creatures within 30 feet, dealing 4d10+20 force damage (DC 46 basic Fortitude save). On a failed save, a creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] or increases their drained and stupefied conditions by 1 (by 2 on a critical failure).
