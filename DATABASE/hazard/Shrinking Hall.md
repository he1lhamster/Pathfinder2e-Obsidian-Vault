<span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Dark Archive]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 18
**Description** This hallway is designed to shrink as creatures traverse it, making access to the door at the hall's end impossible.

---
**Disable** DC 21 [[Thievery]] (trained) to jam the scales built into the floor
**Shrink** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** 100 pounds of weight or more is placed on the hallway's floor; **Effect** The hall's last 40 feet of walls angle inward, causing the hall to shrink and contract down, reaching 6 inches in height and width at the hall's far end and completely blocking access to the hall's exit door for anything but a Tiny creature [[Squeeze]].

**Reset** After 10 minutes without weight being placed on this hall's floor, this trap resets, returning the hall to its original size.
