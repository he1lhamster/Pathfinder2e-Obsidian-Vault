**Shrink** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** 100 pounds of weight or more is placed on the hallway's floor; **Effect** The hall's last 40 feet of walls angle inward, causing the hall to shrink and contract down, reaching 6 inches in height and width at the hall's far end and completely blocking access to the hall's exit door for anything but a Tiny creature [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeezing]].
