<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 190. The Choosing|Pathfinder #190: The Choosing]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 40
**Description** One of the carvings on the mural suddenly animates and clambers out of the painting to become a real creature in the middle of the chamber.

**Disable** DC 35 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (to deface the mural in precisely the right way to render it inoperable), or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (7th level; counteract DC 34) to counteract the mural
**Summon Mukradi** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature attempts to open the door to area **H7**; **Effect** A living [[DATABASE/monster/Mukradi|mukradi]] manifests in the 20-foot-square space indicated by the dotted outline on the map. Any other creatures in this area are knocked prone and pushed out of this square—those who succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save can choose to be pushed north or south, while those who fail are pushed west, out of the room entirely down a 200-foot fall.
 These creatures can [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab the Edge]] with a successful DC 36 Reflex save. The mukradi then rolls initiative but vanishes completely after 1 minute.
