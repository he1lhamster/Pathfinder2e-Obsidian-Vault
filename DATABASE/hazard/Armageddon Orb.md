# Armageddon Orb<span class="item-type">Hazard 23</span>

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 10 or [[Detect Magic]]
**Description** A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of the god [[Rovagug]]’s blood, rains fire from the sky when a specified condition is met.

---
**Disable** [[Thievery]] DC 48 (legendary) to imbue thieves’ tools with aspects representing [[Asmodeus]] and [[Sarenrae]] and use them to drain away the orb’s power over 10 minutes; the character attempting this check takes 5 fire damage each round until the orb is depleted
**Burn It All** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (death, divine, evocation, fire); **Trigger** A special condition set by the trap’s creator occurs; this is typically the event of their death. **Effect** Fire rains from the sky in a 100-mile radius, dealing 10d6 fire damage to creatures and objects in the area. Each creature or object can attempt a DC 46 basic Reflex save. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly. This is not enough damage to completely burn away a forest or level an entire mountain or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.
