**Source** [[Pathfinder 186. Ghost King's Rage]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +29 (master)
**Description** The hall's entry and exit seal with a force barrier, then waves of force surge through the hall.

---
**Disable** DC 48 [[Thievery]] (master) to deface the script without triggering, DC 47 [[Arcana]] (master) to redirect the magical energy, or DC 46 [[Religion]] (master) to quote [[Pharasma]] prayers
**Force Barrier** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (abjuration, divine, force) **Trigger** A creature reaches the hall's midpoint; **Effect** Force barriers seal the hall's entrance and exit for 1 minute. The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) A wave of force flows down the hall from north to south, dealing 3d10+20 force damage to each creature in the corridor. Each creature must attempt a DC 40 basic Reflex save. On a failure, a creature is pushed back 5 feet (10 feet on a critical failure). If this movement would cause a creature to hit another creature, both creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If this movement would cause a creature to hit a force barrier, the creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Animals, plants, and worshippers of Pharasma are immune to this force damage.

---
**Reset** The trap deactivates and resets after 1 minute.
