**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +17 (expert)
**Description** A 5-foot-square metal vault covered with knobs lies concealed within a stone block. A lever on the stone block slides the vault into view. When the vault is exposed—whether it's slid out or whether the stone is smashed open—the trap activates.

---
**Disable** DC 24 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to find and press hidden knobs in a specific order (three successes are required to disable the trap, which also opens it); DC 24 [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] (expert) to sabotage the vault's mechanisms, reducing its actions by 1 (when the trap's actions are reduced to 0, it is disabled)
**AC** 25, **Fort** +18, **Ref** +12
**Keystone Hardness** 12, **Keystone HP** 60 (BT 30); **Vault Hardness** 10; **Vault HP** 50 (BT 25); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Exposed Vault** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The vault is exposed; **Effect** The vault makes a poison dart spray Strike at a random creature within 30 feet. The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) The keystone uses its 3 actions to Electrify, Spin, and then Launch Darts. When the trap loses an action, roll randomly to determine which action it loses.
 **Electrify** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The metal vault crackles with electricity. In air, this would damage only creatures touching it; in water, the trap deals 2d8 electricity damage to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation (DC 25 basic Fortitude save).
 **Launch Darts** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The vault fires a stream of poisoned darts. The trap attacks all creatures in a 30-foot line with its poison dart spray Strike; roll 1d8 to determine the line's direction. These Strikes don't have a multiple attack penalty.
 **Spin** <span class="action-icon">1</span> The vault spins quickly for 1 round. While it Spins, checks to disable the trap have a –2 circumstance penalty, and it Launches Darts at all creatures within 30 feet of it, rather than in a line.
 **Ranged** <span class="action-icon">1</span> poison dart spray +18 (range increment 60 feet); **Damage** 4d4 piercing and 1d8 poison
