# Shadow Heart<span class="item-type">Hazard 9</span>

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 183. Field of Maidens|Pathfinder #183: Field of Maidens]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** DC +20 (expert)
**Description** A heart of tumorous, shadowy tissue unleashes magic on nearby creatures.

---
**Disable** DC 26 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (expert) to counter the heart's offensive magic, or DC 28 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (trained) to purify the area containing the heart. Four successes are required to disable it; after two successes, the shadow heart can't use its shadow lash Strike.
**AC** 28, **Fort** +21, **Ref** +15, **Will** +18
**Hardness** 15, **HP** 72 (BT 36); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage, **Weaknesses** fire 10, positive 10
**Shadow Pulse** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature approaches within 10 feet of the heart; **Effect** The heart gives a slow beat, and all creatures in the room must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] and unable to take reactions for 1 round (stunned 3 on a critical failure). The dark heart then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) The shadow heart uses Battering Vortex, and then uses shadow lash on a random creature within range.
 **Battering Vortex** <span class="action-icon">2</span> A swirling vortex of shadows forms around the heart, lifting all creatures in the room and slamming them forcefully to the ground, dealing 4d10 bludgeoning damage. Each creature must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save. Anyone adjacent to a wall may [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] with a successful DC 28 Reflex save; on a success at Grabbing an Edge, the creature uses a result one step better than the roll of their Fortitude save. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature takes half damage and is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. 
**Failure** The creature takes full damage, is knocked prone, and is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] for 1 round. 
**Critical Failure** The creature takes full damage, is knocked prone, and is clumsy 3 for 1 round.
 **Melee** shadow lash +21 (cold, reach 30 feet), **Damage** 3d4 cold

**Reset** The heart deactivates if there are no creatures present in the room. It resets in 1 hour.
