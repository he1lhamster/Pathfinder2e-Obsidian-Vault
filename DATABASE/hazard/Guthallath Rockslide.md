# Guthallath Rockslide<span class="item-type">Hazard 19</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 156. The Apocalypse Prophet]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +30 (master) to notice the odd aging of the stones, seemingly far older and more weathered than the surrounding rocks
**Description** The rock walls nearby begin to crumble and collapse.

---
**Disable** DC 48 [[Crafting]] (legendary) to buttress the collapsing rocks in three different locations. Using large and durable materials (or applicable spells) to support the rocks reduces the check to DC 45 Crafting (master).
**AC** 42, **Fort** +35, **Ref** +29
**Hardness** 20 (10 in theguthallath's erosion aura), **HP** 150; **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Rumbling Rocks** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The [[Guthallath]] rolls initiative; **Effect** The rocks of the area begin to crumble. The hazard rolls for initiative.

---
**Routine** (2 actions) On the hazard's first action, any areas of crumbling rocks from a previous round collapse, making a falling rocks Strike against each creature in the area. On its second action, the hazard crumbles rocks in a 20- foot radius around the previous collapse. A character can [[Seek]] (DC 40) to determine where the rocks will fall on the following round, but on a critical failure, they incorrectly identify where the rocks will fall.
 **Ranged** <span class="action-icon">1</span> falling rocks +36, **Damage** 4d10+20 bludgeoning **Early Collapse** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Trigger** The hazard takes 30 or more damage; **Effect** Move the hazard's initiative to immediately follow the creature that damaged the hazard.

---
**Reset** The guthallath can reset the hazard with a few days of work stacking the fallen rocks.
