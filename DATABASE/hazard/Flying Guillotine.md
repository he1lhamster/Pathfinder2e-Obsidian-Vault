# Flying Guillotine<span class="item-type">Hazard 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 157. Devil at the Dreaming Palace|Pathfinder #157: Devil at the Dreaming Palace]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +10 (trained) or DC 23 (expert) to spot the glyph
**Description** An invisible magical glyph on the guillotine's blade detects living creatures in the room, which causes the guillotine to fly off its hinges and attack.

---
**Disable** DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to erase the glyph (which requires a successful unarmed attack roll if the blade is already active) or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (3rd level; counteract DC 20) to counteract it. The trap has a secret bypass known only to Ralso and Pratchett: as long as the guillotine can see a creature in the room touching thumb and pinky together with an empty hand, it remains dormant.
**AC** 23, **Fort** +9, **Ref** +17
**Blade Hardness** 13, **Blade HP** 52 (BT 26); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Flying Blade** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (abjuration, arcane, attack) **Trigger** A living creature enters the room; **Effect** One round after a creature enters the room, the door to the room slams shut and locks (two DC 20 Thievery checks to pick), and the guillotine blade detaches from its housing and begins flying around the room as the trap rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) The blade Flies up to 20 feet and Strikes any creatures whose squares it passes through. It cannot target the same creature more than once per round. The blade cannot be grappled and doesn't take a multiple attack penalty.

---
**Reset** After 1 minute, the trap deactivates, though the door remains locked. The trap rearms itself each day at dawn.
