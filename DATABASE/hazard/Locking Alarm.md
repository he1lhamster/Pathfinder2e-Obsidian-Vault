# Locking Alarm<span class="item-type">Hazard 10</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Companion Guide|Kingmaker Companion Guide]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 27 (master)
**Description** Any attempt to open the door without first tracing the symbol of Yhidothrus (an hourglass) on the door's face with a fingertip causes a glowing green ward to seal the door shut and raise an alarm.

---
**Disable** DC 32 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (expert) to bypass the magical triggers on the door, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (5th level, counteract DC 29) to counteract the alarm.
**AC** 25, **Fort** +24, **Ref** +16
**Door Hardness** 18, **Door HP** 70 (BT 35); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Lock and Shriek** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (abjuration, occult) **Trigger** A creature attempts to open or affect the door; **Effect** The religious symbol of Yhidothrus glows green on the door, sealing it shut while simultaneously shrieking like a tormented soul. This howl is audible in areas D1–D4 and is loud enough in area D2 to rouse the bodaks.
 While the door remains locked, a DC 32 Athletics check can [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Force it Open]], or a DC 32 Thievery check can [[DATABASE/action/Pick a Lock|Pick th Lock]]. The lock can also be removed with [[DATABASE/domain/Magic Domain|dispel magic]] (5th level, counteract DC 29).
 Once triggered, the alarm continues to shriek and the door remains locked until the hazard is disabled or the door is destroyed or opened. Tracing Yhidothrus's hourglass-shaped religious symbol on either side of the door with a fingertip disables the alarm and the locking ward.

**Reset** The _locking alarm_ resets after 1 minute.
