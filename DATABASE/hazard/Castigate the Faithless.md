<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 186. Ghost King's Rage]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 47 (master) or DC 50 (legendary) to notice the bypass button hidden in Urgathoa's skeletal feet
**Description** Magic forces those who pass by the statue to the ground with sudden force; pressing the bypass button deactivates the trap for 1 minute.

---
**Disable** DC 47 [[Religion]] (legendary) to deactivate the trap through prayer, [[Dispel Magic]] (8th level; counteract DC 47) to counteract the trap, or press the bypass button
**Kneel!** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, [[Cat]], force) **Trigger** A creature passes by the statue; **Effect** The trap deals 7d12+40 force damage to the triggering creature (DC 46 basic Reflex save). On a failed save, the creature is knocked [[Prone]], and on a critical failure, the creature is knocked prone and takes an additional 1d12 bludgeoning damage from the force of the fall.

---
**Reset** The trap resets automatically if triggered, after 1 minute if the bypass button is pressed, or after 15 minutes if disabled or counteracted.
