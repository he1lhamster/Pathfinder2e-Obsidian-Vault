# Haphazard Wood Pile<span class="item-type">Hazard 1</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 196. The Summer That Never Was]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 17 (trained) to notice how the pile might fall on a person disabling it; DC 0 to see the pile.
**Description** Beams of heavy and sharp wood rest against one another to form a precariously balanced cage tied to several trip lines and tension-bearing dowels.

---
**Disable** DC 17 [[Thievery]] (trained), [[Crafting]] (trained), or [[Lore]] (trained) to figure out how to safely dismantle the pile without it collapsing on anyone.
**Collapse Inward** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Any of the four revelers within the hazard perform any action with the Move trait; **Effect** The pile collapses onto the four revelers, dealing 1d6+5 bludgeoning damage (DC 17 basic Reflex save) to each of them. All four also take 1d6 persistent [[Persistent Damage]] until they're pulled from the rubble with a DC 17 [[Athletics]] check or can [[Escape]] (DC 17).
 **Collapse Outward** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** An attempt to disable the hazard from outside critically fails, or the hazard is intentionally triggered by someone from outside of the wood pile; **Effect** The pile collapses outward, inflicting 1d6+5 bludgeoning damage to the four revelers (DC 15 basic Reflex save), and 2d6+5 bludgeoning damage (DC 17 basic Reflex save) to all creatures in a 10-foot area surrounding the central 10-foot-square where the revelers were trapped.
