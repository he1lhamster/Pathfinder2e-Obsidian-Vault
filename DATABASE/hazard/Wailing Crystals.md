# Wailing Crystals<span class="item-type">Hazard 13</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 148. Fires of the Haunted City]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +27 (master) or DC 37 (master) to notice what appear to be screaming ghostly faces in the crystals
**Description** Three clusters of gleaming, colorful crystals are corrupted with necromantic energy that causes them to reflect negative emotions. All three must be disabled or destroyed to negate the hazard.

---
**Disable** [[Thievery]] DC 29 (master) to carefully fracture the crystals or [[Crafting]] DC 27 (expert) to place objects to stop the resonance, both disabling one 5-foot patch of crystals.
**AC** 34, **Fort** +26, **Ref** +18
**Hardness** 18, **HP** 72 (BT 36) per 5-foot patch; **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Echoing Cry** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (occult); **Trigger** A living creature approaches within 20 feet of a wailing crystal. **Effect** A despairing chorus of cries echoes off the crystals, working its way into the minds of all living creatures in Jewelgate Way Station, affecting them with [[Crushing Despair]] (7th level, DC 33). The hazard rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) The hazard uses each action for an Anguished Shriek. The wailing crystals lose 1 action for each 5-foot patch of crystals that is broken or destroyed.
 **Anguished Shriek** (emotion, enchantment, mental, occult, sonic) A shrieking, distorted face composed of writhing necromantic energy lances out of the crystals to target a random living creature within 20 feet. The target takes 4d6 mental damage and 4d6 sonic damage (DC 33 basic Will save).

---
**Reset** The wailing crystals deactivate and reset once no living creatures are within 20 feet.
