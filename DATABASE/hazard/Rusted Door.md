**Description** Shards of rust extend from the door and crumble away to cling to the flesh and clothes of anyone who attempts to open or damage the door.

---
**Disable** DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] to deface the hidden runes that allow the trap to activate, or DC 21 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] to offer prayers to a non-evil deity to override the ancient influence of Xar-Azmak

**Inflict Rust Creep** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A non-worshipper of Xar-Azmak attempts to open the door or causes damage to it with a melee Strike; **Effect** The triggering creature is exposed to [[DATABASE/disease/Rust Creep|rust creep]] as tendrils of rust-red energy seem to slither out of the rusty patches on the door to rasp strangely gently against exposed skin.
