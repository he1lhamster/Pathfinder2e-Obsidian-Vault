# Volatile Reagents<span class="item-type">Hazard 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Alchemical</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 178. Punks in a Powderkeg]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +5 (trained)
**Description** Potion bottles, alembics, and potent ingredients violently explode when jostled and accidentally combined.

---
**Disable** three DC 20 [[Acrobatics]] or [[Crafting]] checks to sort and separate the bottles of volatile ingredients into groups
**AC** 18, **Fort** +10, **Ref** +8
**HP** 10 (BT 5); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Explosive Catalyst** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Slick drinks Gattlebee's growth serum (page 36); **Effect** The giant lizard bumps into lab tables and workbenches, causing dangerous ingredients to intermix and detonate. The hazard rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) A random 10-foot square in Gattlebee's laboratory explodes, dealing 2d6 damage to creatures and objects in the area (DC 18 basic Reflex save). The damage type is randomly determined each round: acid, cold, electricity, fire, slashing, or sonic.

---
**Reset** The lab contains enough ingredients for this hazard to last 1 minute before all materials are expended. Alternatively, the hazard resets once Slick shrinks to regular size (see below).
