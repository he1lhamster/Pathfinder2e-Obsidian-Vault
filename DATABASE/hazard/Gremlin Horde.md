# Gremlin Horde<span class="item-type">Hazard 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 180. The Smoking Gun]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +18 (expert)
**Description** Three gangs of [[Gremlin]] hide within the [[Spiral Centurion]], cackling with glee and hurling blasts of hex magic. The hazard occupies the same space as the spiral centurion, moving with it.

---
**Disable** DC 25 [[Arcana]], [[Occultism]], or [[Religion]] (trained) to devise counter-hex symbols that frighten and scatter a gremlin gang, or DC 28 [[Acrobatics]] or [[Stealth]] (expert) to capture and scatter a gremlin gang
**AC** 27, **Fort** +11, **Ref** +17
**Hardness** 15 (while inside the centurion), **HP** 22 per gremlin gang
**Hexed Calamity** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature comes within 30 feet of the gremlin horde; **Effect** Every firearm within 30 feet misfires. If a creature is holding the firearm, they can attempt a DC 27 Will save, negating this effect on a success. The hazard rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions; misfortune) The gremlin horde hurls one tinkering curse with each action, targeting an item within 60 feet wielded or worn by a creature. The creature must attempt a DC 27 Will save. The gremlin horde loses 1 action for each gremlin gang that's scattered.
 **Critical Success** The hex bounces back to affect the gremlin horde. For 1 round, all creatures gain a +1 status bonus to checks to disable this hazard.
 **Success** The item is unaffected.
 **Failure** The item becomes unreliable for 1 round. If a creature attempts to Activate the item or Interact with it, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is wasted. If the item doesn't have an active use (such a mundane cloak), the creature wearing the item must instead immediately succeed at a DC 5 flat check or become tangled with the item and fall [[Prone]].
 **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature wielding or wearing the item also becomes [[Clumsy]].

---
**Reset** If not captured or killed, the scattered gremlin gangs regroup after 1d4 hours.
