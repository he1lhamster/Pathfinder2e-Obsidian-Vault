**Routine** (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled sensor. On each action, the trap causes a random 10-foot-by-10-foot space in the arena to suddenly freeze. Each creature that begins its turn in a frozen space takes 2d6+2 cold damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save). A creature that critically fails its save also becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round; if it was already slowed, the creature instead becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] for 1 round. Any amount of fire damage dealt to a slowed or immobilized creature removes the condition. Frozen tiles become unfrozen at the beginning of the trap's next turn.
