# The Putrid Rise<span class="item-type">Hazard 14</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 184. The Ghouls Hunger]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +28 (master)
**Description** The stink of bile suddenly grows as the myriad mouths carved into the walls begin to vomit forth a deluge of acidic slurry.

---
**Disable** DC 33 [[Thievery]] (master) to disrupt the trap's magical network of sensors and effectively “blind” it to targets to react to, DC 38 [[Religion]] (master) to recognize the carvings and recall one of the mantras needed to pass safely, or [[Dispel Magic]] (7th level; counteract DC 32) to counteract the trap.
**Vomit** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The trap's sensors notice a creature on the stairs north of the entrance to area D4; **Effect** The myriad mouths on the walls spew out a foul-smelling acidic slurry along the entire stairwell. The stairs in areas D3 become difficult terrain, and all creatures in area D3 must attempt a DC 34 Reflex saving throw. A creature that is [[Fatigued]] by hunger takes a –2 circumstance penalty to this saving throw. The trap then rolls initiative.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes 4d6 acid damage and is [[Sickened]].
**Failure** The creature takes 8d6 acid damage, is sickened 2, and is knocked [[Prone]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 16d6 acid damage, is sickened 3, is knocked prone, and then tumbles down the stairs. The fall ends once the creature reaches the next lowest landing (note that a creature falling at the lowest flight tumbles into the carrion pit at area D2, but can attempt to [[Grab an Edge]] as detailed in that room). A creature that falls down the steps takes an additional 4d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 32 basic Reflex save) from the tumble, regardless of the total distance traveled.

---
**Routine** (1 action) On its turn, the trap Vomits as its action. As long as the Putrid Rise is active, the stairs in area D3 are difficult terrain.

---
**Reset** The trap deactivates 1 round after no targets can be sensed, but resets immediately.
