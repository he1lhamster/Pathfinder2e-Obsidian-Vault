# Quicksand<span class="item-type">Hazard 3</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +12 (trained) (or –10 and no minimum proficiency if the surface is disturbed)
**Description** A 15-foot-wide patch of water and sand attempts to submerge creatures that step onto it.

---
**Disable** [[Survival]] DC 18 (trained) to disturb the surface
**Submerge** <span class="action-icon">4</span> **Trigger** A Huge or smaller creature walks onto the quicksand. **Effect** The triggering creature sinks into the quicksand up to its waist. The quicksand rolls initiative if it hasn’t already.

---
**Routine** (1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and has to hold its breath to avoid suffocation.
 A creature in the quicksand can attempt a DC 20 [[Athletics]] check to [[Swim]] to either raise itself by one step if it’s submerged to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it’s submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes the hazard and is [[Prone]] in a space adjacent to the quicksand patch. Other creatures can [[Aid]] the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 20 Athletics check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check.

**Reset** The hazard still submerges anyone who walks in, but the surface doesn’t become hidden again until it settles over the course of 24 hours.
