# Cordon Alarm<span class="item-type">Hazard 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Abjuration</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 187. The Seventh Arch|Pathfinder #187: The Seventh Arch]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 18 (trained)
**Description** A hempen rope tied between trees emanates an invisible, cylindrical barrier that sounds an alarm when crossed.

---
**Disable** DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to move the rope without setting of the alarm, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (1st level; counteract DC 16) to disable the rope's magic
**Alarm** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** An object or creature of at least 1 Bulk crosses an invisible vertical barrier extending 30 feet above and below the rope; **Effect** The rope squawks like an angry squirrel from the point where the barrier was breached. This alarm is as loud as a human scream and lasts for 1 minute. If an item or creature is still breaching the barrier at the end of this duration, the alarm immediately triggers again.

---
**Reset** The alarm resets immediately. Multiple breaches can cause the alarm to sound in multiple places at the same time, though the alarm can still be triggered only once per round.
