<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +35 (master) to realize that the glimmering orbs signal a dangerous trap.
**Description** Five globes shoot bolts of force up and down the hall when a second creature reaches its midpoint.

---
**Disable** Thievery DC 48 (master) to deactivate the trap entirely before it triggers, Thievery DC 45 (expert) to deactivate one of the glimmering orbs after the trap rolls initiative, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (9th level; counteract DC 41) to deactivate the trap entirely.
**AC** 42, **Fort** +27, **Ref** +33
**Orb Hardness** 30, **Orb HP** 40 (BT 20); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage, **Resistances** slashing 15
**Slam Doors** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (arcane, [[DATABASE/equipment/Cat|evocation]]) **Trigger** A second creature crosses a magical sensor at the midpoint of the hall. 
The doors at either end of the hall slam shut and lock in place while the trap is active (the doors open automatically if the trap is disabled or destroyed). The doors (Hardness 14, HP 56 [28 BT]) can be [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Forced Open]] with a DC 40 Athletics check, or via a DC 35 Thievery check to [[DATABASE/action/Pick a Lock|Pick the Lock]]. The trap rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (5 actions) Five energized orbs each take one action to make a force bolt attack against a different target in the hallway (a single target cannot be fired at more than once per round by the trap). The trap doesn't take multiple attack penalties. Each orb that is disabled or destroyed reduces the trap's actions by 1.
**Ranged** force bolt +35 (can target any creature in area **A8**), **Damage** 4d10+18 force damage

---
**Reset** The trap deactivates 1 round after it has no creatures to target and resets automatically after 1 minute.
