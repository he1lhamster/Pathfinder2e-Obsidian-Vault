<span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 22
**Description** The bridge creaks and strains alarmingly.

---
**Disable** [[Crafting]] DC 25 to [[Repair]] the bridge as an individual hexploration activity.
**Collapse** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Two or more Medium creatures or a Large or larger creature crosses the bridge; **Effect** The bridge collapses. The triggering creature(s) fall into the river below, taking no damage from the fall itself due to the deep water, but taking 2d8+5 bludgeoning damage (DC 21 basic Reflex save) from falling debris.
