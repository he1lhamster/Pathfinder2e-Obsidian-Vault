# Spirit Cyclone<span class="item-type">Hazard 9</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +20 (expert)
**Description** A cyclone of angry spirits surges around the area.

---
**Disable** DC 30 [[Occultism]] or [[Religion]] (trained) to weaken the haunt; three total successes in any combination are required to disable the haunt
**Gather Spirits** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Two or more creatures enter the area; **Effect** A spiraling column of spirits gather, becoming a whirling cyclone of souls 10 feet wide and 60 feet tall. The haunt then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) The spirit cyclone uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing 2d10+13 negative damage to each creature in its path (DC 32 basic Reflex save). A creature needs to attempt only one save during the cyclone's movement, even if the cyclone moves over its space more than once. On a critical failure, a creature is swept up into the cyclone, becoming [[Grabbed]] ([[Escape]] DC 32). A creature grabbed by the cyclone moves along with the cyclone and takes 1d10+6 additional negative damage at their beginning of its turn, and it must attempt a Reflex save against the cyclone on the cyclone's turn, no matter where the cyclone moves. A creature that successfully Escapes from the cyclone falls from a height of 1d12 × 5 feet.

---
**Reset** The spirit cyclone disperses after 1 minute and resets after 1 day.
