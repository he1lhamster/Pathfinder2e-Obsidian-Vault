# Death's Slumber Ward<span class="item-type">Hazard 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 175. Broken Tusk Moon|Pathfinder #175: Broken Tusk Moon]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +16 (expert)
**Description** A whirlwind of four ephemeral, magical threads dispels the undead and shrouds the living in an endless slumber.

---
**Disable** DC 23 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (expert) or DC 21 [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] (trained) to dissipate one of the four threads. Characters who failed or critically failed a Performance check to participate in Grandfather Eiwa's funeral in Chapter 1 have been able to reflect on the experience; these characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their Performance checks to disable this trap. The trap is destroyed when all four threads are dissipated.
**Breath of Pharasma** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, necromancy) **Trigger** A living or undead creature opens the trunk; **Effect** The ephemeral winds rise, sapping energy. All living and undead creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] (slowed 2 on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (4 actions) Each thread of energy passes through a random living or undead creature within 60 feet, dealing 4d6 damage (DC 22 basic Will save) to the creature. A thread deals negative damage to living creatures and positive damage to undead creatures. Each thread passes through a different random creature, if possible. Each dissipated thread reduces the trap's number of actions by 1.

---
**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 minute after no living or undead creatures are within 100 feet, then resets.
