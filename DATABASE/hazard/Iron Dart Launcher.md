# Iron Dart Launcher<span class="item-type">Hazard 4</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 179. Cradle of Quartz]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 25 (expert)
**Description** A half-dozen iron darts fire from spring-loaded launchers concealed in the desk opposite the front door.

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[Thievery]] (trained) to disable the trigger, or DC 18 [[Acrobatics]] to squeeze through the partially opened door (this doesn't disable the trap but prevents it from triggering)
**AC** 22, **Fort** +14, **Ref** +8
**Hardness** 10, **HP** 50 (BT 25); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Dart** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The front door is fully opened, [[Force Open]], or [[Broken]]; **Effect** A hail of iron darts launches along a 20-foot line from the desk through the doorway, dealing 4d8+10 piercing damage to each creature in the area of effect (DC 24 basic Reflex save).

---
**Reset** The trap resets as soon as the door is closed. It has enough darts to trigger three times, after which, it must be reloaded with 20 darts before it can reset again.
