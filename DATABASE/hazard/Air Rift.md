**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 167. Ready Fight!|Pathfinder #167: Ready? Fight!]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +22 (master) to notice the sudden breeze in the theater
**Description** A portal to the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] rips open onstage, causing roaring winds to tear through the opera house.

---
**Disable** DC 38 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] (master) to sew the magical threads of the rift shut, DC 40 [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] (legendary) to open enough windows and doors to reduce its intensity, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (7th level; counteract DC 34) to counteract the air rift
**Earth Vulnerability** The Elemental [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] is opposed by the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]]. Any spell or magical effect with the [[DATABASE/domain/Earth Domain|earth]] trait that targets a creature or area within 50 feet of the rift deals 10 damage to the rift per spell levels (or per 2 levels for magic items, feats, and so forth). For example, a 3rd-level [[DATABASE/spell/Earthbind|earthbind]] spell cast on a creature near the air rift deals 30 points of damage to the rift.
**AC** 35, **Fort** +30
**HP** 220 ; **Weaknesses** earth vulnerabilty
**Weightlessness** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature comes within 50 feet of the rift; **Effect** The air rift creates a shroud of subjective gravity around the creature for 1 minute. The creature can use a free action, which has the concentrate trait, to choose any direction they wish for gravity to pull them. This allows a creature to Stride along any surface or [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Fly]] in a straight line by choosing a direction into midair. For unattended objects and mindless creatures, this is microgravity: they float in place unless pushed off a surface.

---
**Routine** (1 action) Winds blow through the area in a random direction, causing creatures and objects within 50 feet of the air rift to float up, down, north, south, east, or west (roll a d6 to determine which direction). Creatures and objects in the area must attempt a DC 37 Fortitude save. If a creature is pushed into a solid object or another creature by this effect, both take 3d8+15 bludgeoning damage on impact. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
**Success** The creature is pushed 10 feet, but takes only half damage from impact. 
**Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet, falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]], and takes full damage from impact. 
**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 40 feet, falls prone, and takes double damage from impact.
