**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Night of the Gray Death|Night of the Gray Death]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +36 (Legendary) to realize the chamber is a complex rotating trap before it triggers. No check is necessary to notice the platforms and the pit.
**Description** Several swinging pendulums of force cleave through the room across the platforms, knocking people into the pit.

---
**Disable** DC 48 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] (legendary), DC 44 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (master), or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (9th level; counteract DC 44) on a platform to deactivate its pendulum blade; once all five platforms have been deactivated, the trap is disabled and the room rotates back into position along the exits. DC 48 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (legendary) from any blocked exit to activate the rotating mechanism and rotate the room back into position before the trap has been disabled.
**Locking Room** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature disturbs any of the platforms, or anything falls into the pit; **Effect** The room rotates 45 degrees, closing of the room by shifting its exits to face bare walls. A pendulum of force swings across the platform with the armor on it, knocking the armor into the pit and making a pendulum blade Strike against a creature on that platform (if any). The trap then rolls for initiative.

---
**Routine** (5 actions) For each active platform, the trap uses an action to create a pendulum of force to swing down along a straight line between the platform and one other creature in the room that isn't on the platform (if any). The trap makes a pendulum blade attack against any creature in that line. For each platform deactivated, reduce the number of actions the trap takes in its routine by 1. 
**Melee** pendulum blade +38 (fatal d12, force, magical), **Damage** 4d10+22 force damage plus pendulum shove; no multiple attack penalty 
**Pendulum Shove** A creature hit by a pendulum blade must succeed at a DC 44 Refex save or be moved 5 feet along the line of the pendulum's swing. This is forced movement.

---
**Reset** The trap resets after 1 hour. If the darkness throughout the room has been dispelled, the darkness in the room returns when the trap resets.
