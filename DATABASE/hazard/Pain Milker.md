# Pain Milker<span class="item-type">Hazard 12</span>

<span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 184. The Ghouls Hunger]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 10
**Description** An eerie machine made of levers, crystals, and glowing bits of metal that, as one draws near, causes unsettling aches and pains.

---
**Disable** DC 33 [[Thievery]] (master) to deactivate the machine, or DC 38 Perception (expert) to decipher the proper order in which the switches and dials should be adjusted in order to power the device down harmlessly
**AC** 31, **Fort** +24, **Ref** +18
**Hardness** 22, **HP** 60 (BT 30); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Agonizing Overload** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, necromancy) **Trigger** The pain milker is struck hard enough to take damage, or any of its dials and levers are adjusted carelessly; **Effect** The pain milker emits a shrill whine and exudes a blast of violet light. All creatures in area B2 must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save. This DC is reduced by 2 if the machine is broken.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes 4d10 positive or negative damage (whichever is more harmful).
**Failure** The creature takes 8d10 positive or negative damage (whichever is more harmful) and is [[Enfeebled]].
**Critical Failure** As failure but 16d10 damage and enfeebled 2.

**Reset** If the [[Augnagar]] still lives and at least one [[Falling Debris]] is still functional, the pain milker resets automatically in a number of rounds equal to 7 – the number of remaining crystallized agonies.
