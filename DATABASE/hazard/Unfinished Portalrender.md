**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 184. The Ghouls Hunger|Pathfinder #184: The Ghouls Hunger]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +27 (master)
**Description** A sphere of concentrated agony harvested from a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Qlippoth|qlippoth]] begins pulsing with violet light as it blasts the room with otherworldly agony.

---
**Disable** DC 37 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (master) to dismantle the housing and refocus the agony inward so it consumes itself harmlessly, DC 33 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (master) to vent the agony in a controlled way that causes the _portalrender_ to become inert after 1 minute (during which it can still be triggered normally), or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (7th level; counteract DC 31)
**AC** 34, **Fort** +26, **Ref** +20
**Hardness** 22, **HP** 88 (BT 44)
**Agonizing Pulse** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (emotion, enchantment, mental, occult) **Trigger** The unfinished _portalrender_ takes any damage or is moved (the _portalrender_ is Bulk 5); **Effect** The central sphere of concentrated agony flashes bright violet, filling the mind's of the room's inhabitants with overwhelming mental sensations of pain and hallucinations that the world around them is being torn away and replaced by a demon-haunted apocalypse. All creatures in area B4 must attempt a DC 33 Will save, then the trap rolls initiative. 
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes 4d6 mental damage from the pain.
**Failure** The creature takes 8d6 mental damage from the pain and is [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] until the end of their next turn.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 16d6 mental damage from the pain, is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]], and is confused for 1 minute.

**Routine** (1 action) The unfinished _portalrender_ continues to flood area B4 with agony, and everyone in the room must attempt a DC 33 Will save against its Agonizing Pulse. At the end of its turn, the unfinished _portalrender_ attempts a DC 6 flat check. On a failure, its stores of agony deplete and it deactivates, causing the central orb of agony to fade away permanently
