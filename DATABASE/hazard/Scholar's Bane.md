**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +14 (trained) to notice magical sensors hidden within four of the carvings’ eyes
**Description** Illusion magic overwhelms the minds of particularly intelligent creatures, forcing them to relive every intellectual failure and shame they’ve ever sufered.

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to carve out one eye sensor, DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (trained) to blank out one's mind (disables trap for self only), or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (2nd level; counteract DC 20) to counteract one eye sensor
**AC** 20, **Fort** +12, **Ref** +8
**Eye Hardness** 6, **Eye HP** 20
**Reveal Failure** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature with an Intelligence score of 10 or greater enters the room; **Effect** The trap flls the triggering creature's mind with shameful memories. The creature must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or take 2d8+2 mental damage. The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (4 actions) The trap uses each action to target a creature in the room with an Intelligence score of 10 or greater. A target must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or take 2d8+2 mental damage. On a critical failure, the creature takes a –10-foot status penalty to Speed for 1 minute as they stagger under the weight of their failures. The trap loses 1 action for each eye sensor disabled or destroyed.

---
**Reset** The trap can function for 10 rounds, which don’t need to be consecutive, before it must recharge for 24 hours.
