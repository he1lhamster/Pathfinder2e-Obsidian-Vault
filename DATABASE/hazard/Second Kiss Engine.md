# Second Kiss Engine<span class="item-type">Hazard 6</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 179. Cradle of Quartz]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** -1
**Description** Exposed clockwork gears spin at high speeds.

---
**Disable** DC 28 [[Thievery]] (expert) to disable the engine, or DC 26 [[Lore]] to disengage the drive shaft. Either method disables the trap but also shuts down the engine, disabling the _Second Kiss's_ propulsion.
**AC** 27, **Fort** +15, **Ref** +18
**Hardness** 10, **HP** 50 (BT 25); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Spinning Gears** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature Strides in the engine nacelle; **Effect** The creature's clothing or limbs get caught in the spinning gears and axles of the engine. The creature must attempt a DC 24 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes 2d8+9 bludgeoning damage.
**Failure** The creature takes 4d8+18 bludgeoning damage.
**Critical Failure** The creature's clothing is pulled into the clockworks. The creature takes 4d8+18 bludgeoning damage and is [[Restrained]]. Until the creature [[Escape]] (DC 24), it takes 2d8+9 bludgeoning damage each round as it's pulled into the spinning rotors. A creature wearing clothing can automatically Escape by doffing its caught clothing; this destroys the doffed clothing.
