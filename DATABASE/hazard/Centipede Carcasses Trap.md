# Centipede Carcasses Trap<span class="item-type">Hazard 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 169. Kindled Magic|Pathfinder #169: Kindled Magic]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +11 (trained)
**Description** Three giant centipede carcasses have wire springs that pull out and fling their sharpened legs around the room.

---
**Disable** DC 23 [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] (trained) to bend the centipede carapace so the wire can't pull out any more legs, or DC 21 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (expert) to cut the springy wires. After all three carcasses are disabled (regardless of the check used), the trap is deactivated. The trap automatically deactivates after 10 rounds.
**AC** 22, **Fort** +15, **Ref** +9
**Carcass Hardness** 12, **Carcass HP** 20 (BT 10); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage.
**Volley of Legs** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A carcass is touched or jostled; **Effect** Each creature within 30 feet of any centipede carcass takes 4d4 piercing damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save), and the area becomes difficult terrain due to the many sharpened legs on the ground. Each creature that Strides more than 10 feet through the area must succeed at a DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check or take 1d4 piercing damage. The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) Each creature within 30 feet of a centipede carcass that hasn't been disabled takes 6d4 piercing damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save).
