**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 188. They Watched the Stars|Pathfinder #188: They Watched the Stars]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +12 (expert)
**Description** The party's memories of Osoyo coalesce into a titanic mirage in the storm clouds above.

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (trained) or DC 24 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] (trained) to divert the memory's rage; three total successful checks are required to disable the hazard.
**Glacial Gust** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The characters' shared vision during **Event 15** subsides; **Effect** The memory of Osoyo unleashes a tremendous sigh of freezing wind, coating the deck of the _Mermaid's Tears_ in ice in a 60-foot cone. (The hazard can choose any point for the cone to originate.) The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent cold damage]] as the freezing wind cuts to the bone. The hazard then rolls initiative.

**Routine** (1 action) The memory of Osoyo gives a keening scream that shatters the layer of ice coating the deck of the _Mermaid's Tears_. Any creature on difficult terrain created by the memory's Glacial Gust takes 2d8+7 cold damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save) from the icy shrapnel.
