# The Fight<span class="item-type">Hazard 9</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 183. Field of Maidens|Pathfinder #183: Field of Maidens]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +20 (expert)
**Description** Nearby creatures are caught in the memory of the struggle between Iron Taviah and the Benefactor.

---
**Disable** DC 28 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (expert) in the room to drain away the haunt's spiritual energy. Each successful check reduces the number of actions in the haunt's routine; three successful checks are required to completely disable the haunt.
**AC** 30, **Fort** +18, **Ref** +21, **Will** +15
**Hardness** 15, **HP** 70 (BT 35); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage, **Weaknesses** positive 10
**Spectral Combat** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, mental, necromancy) **Trigger** A creature approaches within 10 feet of the spilled goblet; **Effect** The desperation of the sudden fight fills the minds of all creatures in the dining room as the apparition of Iron Taviah at the north end of the table lunges. The haunt deals 4d10 mental damage (DC 30 basic Will save) to each creature in the room. On a failed save, the creature also takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent mental damage]]. The haunt then rolls for initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) The spectral Taviah uses 1 action to appear adjacent to a random creature within 30 feet if not already adjacent to a creature. It then uses its spectral claw Strike with its remaining actions.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> spectral claw +21 (agile), **Damage** 2d10+10 slashing plus 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent mental]]

---
**Reset** Unless completely disabled or destroyed, the haunt resets at the next moonrise at full strength.
