<span class="item-trait">Illusion</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 23 (trained; or 0 if the illusory floor is dispelled)
**Description** The floor in this chamber is an illusion, which conceals a 40-foot drop to the true floor below. Additionally, the area beneath the floor is magically silenced—no sound is audible within nor does sound leave this space.

---
**Disable** Succeeding on a Perception check against the [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] DC of 21 (including the check to find the trap) disbelieves the illusory floor, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (2nd level; counteract DC 18) to dispel the illusory floor; _dispel magic_ (2nd level; counteract DC 20) to dispel the magical silence
**Drop** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature walks onto the illusory floor; **Effect** The triggering creature falls through the illusory floor and takes falling damage (typically 20 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use the [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] reaction to avoid falling. The DC to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]] the walls or Grab an Edge is 20.
