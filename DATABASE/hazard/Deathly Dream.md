# Deathly Dream<span class="item-type">Hazard 15</span>

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 173. Doorway to the Red Star|Pathfinder #173: Doorway to the Red Star]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 38 (master)
**Description** Sinister runes adorn the doorway, opening a portal to a realm of nightmares if anyone other than Dwandek opens the door.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC 40 (master) to seal the rift using materials strongly grounded to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]], or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (7th-level, counteract DC 33) to counteract the portal.
**AC** 34, **Fort** +29, **Ref** +23
**Hardness** 24, **HP** 96 (BT 48); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Drawn to Nightmare** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (arcane, conjuration, teleportation); **Trigger** A creature other than Dwandek opens the door; **Effect** The triggering creature is drawn into a pocket plane of pure nightmare (DC 38 Will save to resist). Each round at the start of their turn, the creature takes 4d8 mental damage as they are assaulted by otherworldly visions, and must succeed at a new Will save against the original DC to be ejected from the pocket plane and deposited in the center of area A5.

---
**Reset** The deathly dream trap resets automatically as long as it hasn't been disabled or destroyed. Each time it resets, the tiny pocket plane of nightmare it sends its victim into resets as well, so no two victims will ever share the same deathly dream.
