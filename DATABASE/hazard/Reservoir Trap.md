<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 187. The Seventh Arch]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +11 (trained); DC 19 (expert) to notice the water tank bulging under the immense pressure
**Description** Pipes extending from a pressurized water tank spray fesh-cutting jets of water at unwary passersby.

---
**Disable** DC 18 [[Thievery]] (trained) to safely puncture a pipe, or DC 16 [[Lore]] (trained) to find and turn a pressure release valve; any combination of three punctured pipes or turned valves disables the trap
**AC** 18, **Fort** +11, **Ref** +3
**Tank Hardness** 7, **Tank HP** 50 (BT 25); **Pipe Hardness** 7, **Pipe HP** 30 (BT 15); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Water Jets** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature steps on a floor space in this room; **Effect** Seals on the water pipes burst, issuing forth high-pressure water jets in random directions. The hazard makes a water jet Strike against the triggering creature. The hazard rolls initiative. Violent Deluge <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The water tank is broken or destroyed; **Effect** A torrent of water bursts from the shattered tank, dealing 3d8 bludgeoning damage to each creature within 15 feet (basic DC 22 Refex save). The trap is then disabled.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) For each pipe destroyed or disabled, the trap loses 1 action. On each of the trap's actions, the trap targets a random creature in the room with a water jet Strike.
 **Ranged** water jet +11 (water), Damage 2d8 piercing; no multiple attack penalty

---
**Reset** The trap deactivates after 5 rounds. It cannot be reactivated until the reservoir is ref lled, which takes an average of 5 days.
