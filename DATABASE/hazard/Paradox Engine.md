**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Shadows at Sundown|Shadows at Sundown]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +0
**Description** All six sides of this [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine|adamantine]]-reinforced box are covered with Thassilonian runes. Touching a rune allows one to exchange its position with another.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC 41 (expert) to feel the subtle vibrations when moving a rune to shift into the right position, or [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Thassilon Lore]] DC 33 (expert) or [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] DC 38 (master) while being able to read Thassilonian to work out the anagram puzzle using traditional means, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (7th level; counteract DC 34)
**AC** 36, **Fort** +28, **Ref** +22
**Hardness** 24, **HP** 90 (BT 45); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Slicing Shadows** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (arcane, conjuration) **Trigger** The paradox engine is damaged, or a creature fails a check to disable it; **Effect** Slats on the sides of the box open to release beams of razor-sharp freezing darkness that swipe throughout area C5 and extend 10 feet south into area C4; all creatures in this area who lack the [[DATABASE/monster/Shadow|Shadow]] trait take 5d6 slashing damage and 5d6 cold damage (DC 34 basic Reflex save).

---
**Routine** 3 (arcane, conjuration) The slicing shadows congeal into the form of what appears to be the upper half of a skeletal, cowled humanoid: an [[DATABASE/monster/Owb Prophet|owb prophet]]. This owb prophet is a creation of the paradox engine and does not have a forsaken patron. While the owb prophet is active, the paradox engine no longer uses its Slicing Shadows reaction; instead, the owb prophet focuses its attacks on creatures that attempt to damage or deactivate the engine. If the owb prophet is destroyed, the paradox engine's disable DCs and Hardness are reduced by 5. It thereafter functions as a simple hazard with the Slicing Shadows reaction, and resets after 1 round.

---
**Reset** The paradox engine deactivates 1 minute, and its owb prophet returns to its interior after all creatures leave the area, but resets immediately thereafter.
