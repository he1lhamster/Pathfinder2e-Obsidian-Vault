<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 152. Legacy of the Lost God]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +20 (expert)
**Description** Ten masks adorn twelve stone statues.

---
**Disable** DC 29 [[Religion]] (expert) or [[Occultism]] or DC 31 [[Thievery]] (expert) to dismiss the magic on a single statue. Replacing the two missing masks (a mask made of or incorporating coins on the merchant statue and a mask made of any valuable fabric on the tailor statue) and succeeding at a DC 27 Religion check disarms the trap.
**AC** 30, **Fort** +20, **Ref** +16
**Statue Hardness** 18, **Statue HP** 48 (BT 24); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Unmasked Statues** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (occult) **Trigger** A creature removes the mask from a statue; **Effect** The trap casts [[Phantasmal Killer]] (DC 27) against the creature, creating an image of the statue lunging forth. The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) An unmasked statue casts [[Phantasmal Killer]] (DC 27) against a target in the room for each of the trap's actions, creating an image of the statue lunging forth. It doesn't affect the same creature more than once; if there are fewer targets than it has actions, the trap doesn't use its remaining actions. Unmasking an additional statue increases the hazard's actions by 1, and replacing a mask reduces its actions by 1.

---
**Reset** The trap deactivates and resets 1 minute after it has no target creatures.
