# Scalding Tar Lake<span class="item-type">Hazard 9</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** DC +0 (the tar lake is blatantly obvious, and its effects occur near the end of each round)
**Description** The bubbling tar churns and seethes, periodically bursting in a burning hot splatter of scalding sludge and gas.

---
**Disable** DC 30 Survival check to throw rocks or other bits of debris into areas within the tar lake that are about to burst, allowing the lake to vent harmlessly for that round (on a critical success, this prevents the lake from venting for 3 rounds); permanently disabling the tar pit would require powerful magic or long-term engineering projects (subject to the GM's discretion).
**Scalding Burst** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature attempts to move through the tar; **Effect** A scalding burst of hot tar burns the creature, which must immediately attempt a DC 28 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.
**Success** The creature takes 3d6 fire damage.
**Failure** The creature takes 6d6 fire damage and 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]].
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 9d6 fire damage, 2d6 persistent fire damage and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed as long as it continues to take the persistent fire damage from the hot tar clinging to it.

---
**Routine** (1 action) The bubbling lake of tar churns and sputters. One randomly determined target within 5 feet of the tar lake is targeted by a Scalding Burst.
