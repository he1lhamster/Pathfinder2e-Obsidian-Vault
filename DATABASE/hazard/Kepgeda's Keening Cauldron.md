# Kepgeda's Keening Cauldron<span class="item-type">Hazard 3</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 181. Zombie Feast]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +10 (trained)
**Description** The cauldron's ear-splitting keening calls forth spectral claws to assail ears and souls alike.

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[Athletics]] to tip the cauldron, or DC 20 [[Occultism]] or [[Religion]] (trained) to ward against the cauldron's effects. Any combination of three successful attempts is required to fully disable the haunt. When the haunt is disabled, the coven seeks vengeance (see Coven's Vengeance)
**AC** 20, **Fort** +12, **Ref** +6, **Will** +6
**Hardness** 10, **HP** 48 (BT 24); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage, **Weaknesses** positive 5
**Crescendo of Claws** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental); **Trigger** A creature other than Kepgeda is within 15 feet of the cauldron for at least 1 round; **Effect** The screams increase in intensity, and a torrent of phantasmal, three-fingered hands with iron claws spews from the cauldron to assail creatures in area E13. Each creature in the room must attempt a DC 23 Will save, with the following results. Kepgeda is immune to the haunt's effects, as she loves the cauldron's screams. The haunt then rolls initiative.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature becomes [[Frightened]].
**Failure** The creature becomes frightened 2 and becomes [[Flat-Footed]] as long as they remain frightened.
**Critical Failure** The creature becomes frightened 3 and is [[Grabbed]] as long as they remain frightened.

---
**Routine** The spectral hands scurry about, grabbing at all of Kepgeda's foes in area E13. Each such creature takes 3d6 mental damage (DC 20 basic Will save) as the spectral claws assail them. A creature that takes mental damage from this effect doesn't reduce their frightened value at the end of their next turn.

---
**Reset** The haunt becomes inert (resuming its usual screaming) at the end of any round in which no creatures other than Kepgeda remain in her kitchen.
