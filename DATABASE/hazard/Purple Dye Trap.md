# Purple Dye Trap<span class="item-type">Hazard 3</span>

<span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 178. Punks in a Powderkeg|Pathfinder #178: Punks in a Powderkeg]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 20 (trained)
**Description** A spring-loaded glass jar containing purple dye and a [[DATABASE/equipment/Thunderstone|thunderstone]] pops from the ground and explodes when a pressure sensor is triggered.

---
**Disable** DC 17 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to remove the jar and thunderstone carefully or DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] to reinforce the flagstone pressure sensor with an improvised wedge
**AC** 15, **Fort** +10, **Ref** +4
**Flagstone Hardness** 7, **Flagstone HP** 44 (BT 22); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Exploding Jar** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature or object weighing at least 50 pounds is placed on one of the flagstones running north to south on the west side of the yard (marked “T” on the map on page 32); **Effect** A glass jar containing purple dye and a thunderstone pop from the ground between the flagstones. The sudden movement causes the thunderstone to clink against the jar and explode. All creatures in a 10-foot radius take 2 sonic damage and must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be [[DATABASE/condition/Deafened|deafened]] for 1 round. In addition, each creature in that area is splattered with purple dye and showered with glass, taking 1d4+2 piercing damage (DC 20 basic Reflex save). Creatures splattered with purple dye take a –1 circumstance penalty to Charisma-based skill checks. Fully dying the affected hair or clothing removes this penalty. Dyed skin fades after a week but can be covered up with a successful DC 12 Disguise check and the appropriate cosmetics.
