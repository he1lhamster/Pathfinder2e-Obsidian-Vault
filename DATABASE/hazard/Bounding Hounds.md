**Routine** (9 actions) The trap loses 3 actions each round for each hound disabled. Each hound uses three actions to Stride 40 feet after creatures in the room, passing through corporeal creatures during this movement if possible.

A creature can only be damaged by each hound once each round, no matter how many times the hound moves through their space.
