**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 152. Legacy of the Lost God|Pathfinder #152: Legacy of the Lost God]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +19 (expert) to detect the magical sensor; noticing the wheel has a DC of 0
**Description** An ornate wheel, divided into eight segments with a rune painted on each, is mounted on a pole and controlled by a lever that can be triggered manually or a sensor that detects creatures within 30 feet in front of it.

---
**Disable** DC 31 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (master) on the wheel to flip the switch returning it to a harmless carnival game, DC 26 Thievery (expert) to erase each rune, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (5th level; counteract DC 28) to counteract each rune
**AC** 30, **Fort** +21, **Ref** +15
**Hardness** 16, **HP** 80 (BT 40); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Wheel Spin** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature pulls the lever or enters the sensor's detection area; **Effect** The wheel begins to spin and rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (2 actions) On its initiative, the trap uses its first action to spin, then stops. Roll 1d8 to determine which segment is topmost when the wheel stops spinning. The wheel uses its second action to replicate the spell listed for that segment (5th level, DC 27, spell attack roll +17). This spell's target is centered on or otherwise includes the nearest creature in the spell's area. This increases the spell's range to 30 feet if necessary. Any spell cast by this trap is occult.
