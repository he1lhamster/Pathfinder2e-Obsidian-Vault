**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 25 (trained); DC 0 to spot the balanced boulders
**Description** A weight-sensitive plate buried underneath sand pulls a boulder over a cliff ledge, causing it to fall on targets within the entrance.

**Deadfall** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature enters the area without taking care to avoid the hidden trigger plate; **Effect** Creatures within 10 feet of the cave entrance take 4d10+18 damage (DC 25 basic Reflex save).
