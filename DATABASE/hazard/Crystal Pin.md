**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 10
**Description** Ebeshra fires a crystal at a creature to pin them onto the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]].

---
**Disable** DC 48 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (legendary) or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (legendary) to earn Ebeshra's favor and allow safe travel or DC 51 [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] (master) to momentarily divert Ebeshra's attention
**Fire Pin** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature Ebeshra can see begins to use a teleportation effect or an effect that would move any number of targets to a different plane; **Effect** Ebeshra hurls a crystal at the triggering creature. The triggering creature and all creatures within 50 feet of the creature take 16d8 piercing damage (DC 45 basic Reflex save) and additional effects based on the result of their save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The effect is counteracted, and the creature can't use teleportation effects or planar travel effects for 1 minute.
**Failure** As success, but for 1 day instead of 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** As success, but for 1 week instead of 1 minute. Additionally, the creature becomes pinned under the crystal and must succeed at 3 total DC 45 checks to [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] from under the crystal.

**Reset** Ebeshra waits 1d4 rounds to break off another crystal.
