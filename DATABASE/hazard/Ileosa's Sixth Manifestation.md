<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Shadows at Sundown|Shadows at Sundown]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 37 (expert)
**Description** Ileosa manifests as a crimson ghost and reaches out as if to receive a gift from the ritual's primary caster.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] DC 37 (expert) or DC 40 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occult]] (trained) to reverse the ritual's power.
**Queen's Laugh** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) **Trigger** Someone attempts to contact Ileosa with call spirit and achieves any result other than a critical success to cast the ritual; **Effect** Ileosa closes her fingers and attempts to pull the primary caster's heart from their chest. The primary caster must attempt a DC 33 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.
**Success** The creature feels Ileosa's hand grip and tug at their heart; they take 25 negative damage, and then the manifestation vanishes.
**Failure** As success, but the creature takes 50 negative damage and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]] as they momentarily see their heart appear in Ileosa's hand before the manifestation vanishes.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 75 negative damage and becomes drained 2. If this reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, the target dies instantly. For a brief moment, the victim's heart appears in Ileosa's hand before the manifestation vanishes. If the victim is slain by this hazard, their heart drops to the ground with a splat, pulsing its final beats after the manifestation vanishes.
