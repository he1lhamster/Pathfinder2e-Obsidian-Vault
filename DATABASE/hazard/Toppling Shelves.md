# Toppling Shelves<span class="item-type">Hazard 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 188. They Watched the Stars|Pathfinder #188: They Watched the Stars]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 18 (trained) to notice the shelf's precarious instability
**Description** This stone bookshelf is badly compromised. It's just one push away from toppling over.

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (expert) or [[DATABASE/armor/Gi|Engineering Lore]] (trained) to shore up the shelf
**AC** 18, **Fort** +8, **Ref** +8
**Hardness** 8, **HP** 30 (BT 15), any attack that fails to destroy the shelf triggers its Topple reaction; **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Topple** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** The shelf is attacked or touched forcefully (such as by a creature [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shoved]] into it); **Effect** The shelf tumbles over in the direction opposite its triggering creature, crashing onto the ground in a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. Creatures in the area take 4d8+10 bludgeoning damage (DC 25 basic Reflex save). A creature that critically fails its save falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]]. The affected area becomes difficult terrain.
 If the toppling shelf crashes into a space occupied by another toppling shelf, it triggers that shelf's Topple reaction. This can result in a chain reaction that causes multiple shelves to Topple, one after the other.
