# Ostovite Nest<span class="item-type">Hazard 2</span>

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 181. Zombie Feast|Pathfinder #181: Zombie Feast]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +11 (trained)
**Description** A nest of bones resembling an ant hill contains countless miniscule scavenger vermin with vicious, acid-dripping mandibles.

---
**Disable** DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] (trained) to topple the mound and destroy it
**AC** 18, **Fort** +11, **Ref** +5
**Hardness** 7, **HP** 30 (BT 15); **Immunities** acid, critical hits, object immunities, precision damage, **Weaknesses** area damage 5, bludgeoning 5, splash damage 5
**Skittering Surge** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature comes within 15 feet of the nest; **Effect** A mass of skittering ostovite hatchlings crawls all over the nest, spewing acid in all directions. Each creature within 30 feet of the nest takes 1d10+4 acid damage (DC 18 basic Reflex save). A creature who fails the save also takes 1 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent acid damage]]. The hazard then rolls initiative.

**Routine** (1 action) The hazard makes an acid spew Strike against the nearest creature.
**Ranged** <span class="action-icon">1</span> acid spew +11 (range increment 30 feet), **Damage** 1d10+4 acid

---
**Reset** The hazard deactivates if there are no targets for its acid spew at the start of its turn. The hatchlings return to the nest, and the hazard resets. If damaged but not destroyed, the nest recovers 1d6 Hit Points per hour as the hatchlings repair it.
