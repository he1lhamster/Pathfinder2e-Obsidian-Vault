# Rushing Waters<span class="item-type">Hazard 3</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Rusthenge]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 20 (trained)
**Description** Rivulets of water begin to run from the circle of stones to gather in a growing puddle at the center.

---
**Disable** DC 20 [[Thievery]] (expert) to rub out the hidden runes on the ceiling, or [[Dispel Magic]] (2nd level, counteract DC 18) to counteract the trap
**Spherical Deluge** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (arcane, conjuration, water) **Trigger** A creature enters the area south of the ring of stones marked on the map; **Effect** A deluge of water rises up from the ring of stones, then flows forcefully down the passageway to drain into the pit at area **F1b**. Large and smaller creatures in the water's path must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. The rushing waters vanish instantly upon striking the pit floor, but do leave everything down there sopping wet.
**Critical Success** The creature withstands the force of the rushing waters and is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage as the rushing waters slam them into a cave wall.
**Failure** The creature is knocked [[Prone]] by the rushing waters, takes 1d10+6 bludgeoning damage, and is pushed by the water to the spiky pit trap and triggers the trap.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature can't attempt to [[Grab an Edge]] if they fall into the [[Spiky Pit Trap]].

**Reset** The magic rejuvenates over 10 minutes, after which it is recharged and ready to activate again.
