# Thief's Trap<span class="item-type">Hazard 20</span>

<span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 156. The Apocalypse Prophet]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 50 (master) to notice that the hairline cracks on the passage walls actually form runes.
**Description** Nearly imperceptible runes set off an explosion at the point a thief is most unable to receive aid.

---
**Disable** DC 45 [[Thievery]] (master) or [[Dispel Magic]] (10th level, counteract DC 50) to counteract the runes
**Explosion** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature crosses a rune; **Effect** The runes unleash a gout of fire roaring up the chute. Anyone in the chute and within 5 feet of its openings is dealt 8d10+44 fire damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). Immediately thereafter, the runes emanate a 4th-level [[Silence]] effect for 1 minute, so anyone injured in the chute can't call out for help.

---
**Reset** The trap resets in 1 minute.
