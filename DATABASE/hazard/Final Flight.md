# Final Flight<span class="item-type">Hazard 5</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 176. Lost Mammoth Valley|Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 26 (expert)
**Description** A creature experiences the death of a priest carried off by griffons and fed to their chicks.

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] (trained) to soothe the restless spirits, or DC 24 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (trained) to recite a prayer honoring the deceased; two successful checks are required to disable the haunt
**Final Flight** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (illusion, mental, occult) **Trigger** A creature enters the gathering circle; **Effect** The triggering creature experiences the last moments of the priest who once tended the Lea of Honored Souls. Griffons swoop down from the sky and snatch the priest up in their claws, dealing 1d8+7 slashing damage. They're carried southwest across the valley to a mountain peak and dropped into a nest of young griffons. As the chicks devour the priest, the character takes 1d8+7 piercing damage and 2d8 mental damage. The affected creature must then attempt a DC 22 Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage from all damage dealt by the haunt.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes full damage and can't shake off the vision; they take 1d8 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] and are [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] 1—believing they're being eaten alive—as long as the bleed damage persists.

**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all living creatures leave the Lea of Honored Souls. Ten minutes after deactivating, the haunt resets.
