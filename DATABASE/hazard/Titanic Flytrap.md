<span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gamemastery Guide|Gamemastery Guide]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 25 (trained)
**Description** On the surface, a titanic flytrap appears to be a patch of the more common flytrap plant, but beneath murky waters it hides a far larger set of jaws, reaching 10 feet across and reinforced with woody branches and lined with paralytic hairs.

**AC** 21, **Fort** +15, **Ref** +8

**Snap Shut** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A Small or Medium creature moves into a square that is within reach of the flytrap’s hidden jaws; **Effect** The flytrap’s jaws snap shut, making a jaws Strike against the triggering creature.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws +17, **Effect** devour 
**Devour** The target is trapped by the flytrap’s jaws, gaining the [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] condition until it [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]] (DC 21). Additionally, it is exposed to the titanic flytrap toxin from the hundreds of tiny hairs that line the inside of its leaves. If the flytrap’s jaws Strike was a critical success, the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its saving throws against this poison. At the end of each of target’s turns that it remains grabbed, the target takes 3d6 acid damage.
 **Titanic Flytrap Toxin** (contact, poison) **Saving Throw** DC 21 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 4 rounds; **Stage 1** 2d6 poison damage and [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]] (1 round); **Stage 2** 3d6 poison damage and stunned 2 (1 round); **Stage 3** 4d6 poison damage and [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] (1 round)
