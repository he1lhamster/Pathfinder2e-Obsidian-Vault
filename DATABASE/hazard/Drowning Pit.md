**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +10 (trained); DC 22 (expert) to notice the water spouts once the pit opens
**Description** A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that’s 30 feet deep and has 5 feet of water at the bottom. Four water spouts in the walls connect to hidden water tanks. Each water spout extends out of a different wall, 6 inches from the top of the pit.

**Pitfall** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature walks onto the trapdoor. **Effect** The triggering creature falls in and takes damage from the fall, reduced by 5 feet for falling into the water (typically 12 bludgeoning damage). A creature can [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] to avoid falling. The trapdoor then slams shut, and the hazard rolls initiative.

**Routine** (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled water spout. On each of the trap’s actions, a spout pours water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet. Once the pit is full of water, the pit stops using actions, but creatures in the pit begin drowning.

**Reset** The trap can be reset if the door is manually reengaged and the water tanks refilled; it can be reset without draining the pit, but doing so renders it less effective.
