# Paranoia Well<span class="item-type">Hazard 19</span>

<span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 47 (legendary)
**Description** Sudden invasive emotions of fear, paranoia, and anger well up in the mind, causing companions to take on sinister casts to their no-longer familiar features.

---
**Disable** Intimidate DC 47 (legendary) to shout down the emotional energies and exert mental dominance over them, or Thievery DC 44 (master) to cause the trap's energies to discharge harmlessly
**Reveal the Enemy** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (curse, fear, emotion, enchantment, mental, occult) **Trigger** A Small or larger creature ends its turn inside of area **B7**; **Effect** The trap releases its built-up emotional energy in a silent blast of power. All creatures in area **B7** or within 20 feet of the shed's exterior walls must attempt a DC 41 Will save (creatures within the shed take a –2 circumstance penalty to this save).
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** For 1 hour, the creature treats no other creatures as allies and can't take concentrate actions that don't have the rage trait.
**Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature must attack any creature it detects, preferring to attack former friends or allies when possible.
