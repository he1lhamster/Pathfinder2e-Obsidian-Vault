# Breath of Despair<span class="item-type">Hazard 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +13 (trained)
**Description** The faces carved on the wall appear to inhale, then exhale slithering tendrils of darkness to harm those who would despoil the tomb.

---
**Disable** Thievery DC 23 (expert) to disarm the trap's sensors in the chamber floor, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (3rd level; counteract DC 23) to counteract the faces. Breaking one of the faces on the walls reduces the trap's save DC, attack rolls, and its total actions by 1 per broken face; if all four faces are destroyed, the trap is disabled.
**AC** 22, **Fort** +15, **Ref** +9
**Face Hardness** 12, **Face HP** 30 (BT 15); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Draining Inhalation** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, necromancy) **Trigger** A non-flying living creature moves more than 10 feet into area **C2**; **Effect** Each face inhales then exhales, and all living creatures in area **C2** feel their strength and vitality being drawn out of them as tendrils of shadow from the faces latch onto their bodies. Each creature must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled]] 1 (enfeebled 2 on a critical failure).

---
**Routine** (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled face each turn. On each action, a different face spews a writhing breath of darkness from its mouth to a target in area C2. A creature can only be targeted once per round by the despairing breath, so if fewer than four creatures are in the room, the trap won't be able to take full advantage of all four of its actions. 
**Ranged** despairing breath +17 (fear, mental), **Damage** 2d8+7 mental damage; no multiple attack penalty. A creature damaged by the despairing breath must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]] 1 (or [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] 1 on a critical failure); this effect has the fear trait.

**Reset** The trap resets after 1 minute.
