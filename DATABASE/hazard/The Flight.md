# The Flight<span class="item-type">Hazard 9</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 183. Field of Maidens|Pathfinder #183: Field of Maidens]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +21 (expert)
**Description** The spectral figure of a handsome, well-dressed man flees down the stairs, clutching a wound in his side with one hand and making a shoving motion with the other. His shout drives creatures back.

---
**Disable** DC 30 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (expert) to drain away the haunt's spiritual energy. This check can be attempted only from the top of the stairs behind the secret door.
**Defensive Shove** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, [[DATABASE/equipment/Cat|evocation]]) **Trigger** The secret door to the basement stairs opens; **Effect** The spectral figure's shout shoves every creature in the room away from the east wall. Creatures in the drawing room or the adjacent foyer must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save. The haunt then rolls initiative.
**Critical Success** The creature isn't moved.
**Success** The creature is pushed back 10 feet. If this movement would push it into a wall, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to the number of feet it was moved.
**Failure** As success, but 20 feet and the creature is knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]].
**Critical Failure** As success, but 20 feet, and the creature is knocked prone and [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 2]].

---
**Routine** (1 action) (divine, [[DATABASE/equipment/Cat|evocation]], incapacitation, sonic) The spectral figure shouts, dealing 4d10 sonic damage to all creatures within 60 feet of the secret door (DC 28 basic Will save). A creature that fails its save is also [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 round.

---
**Reset** The haunt ends as soon as there are no creatures within 60 feet. It resets when the secret door is closed.
