# Camouflaged Spiked Pit<span class="item-type">Hazard 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 31 (expert)
**Description** A 20-foot deep, funnel-shaped pit with dozens of wooden spikes lining its walls.

---
**Disable** Yanking the cloth away is a simple way to expose the danger to allow someone to merely avoid it by walking around its edges, but it cannot be quickly disabled.
**Spiked Pitall** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature walks onto one of the pits; **Effect** The triggering creature falls and rolls through several spikes as it slides to the bottom. This inflicts 5 bludgeoning damage from the fall itself down the steep slope (the falling PC can't attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] due to the lack of defined edges to the pit's walls), but the falling PC must also attempt a DC 26 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The character avoids all of the spikes and takes no additional damage.
**Success** The character takes 2d10+11 piercing damage from the spikes.
**Failure** The character takes 4d10+22 piercing damage from the spikes.
**Critical Failure** The character takes 4d10+22 piercing damage from the spikes plus 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|bleed]]damage. While the character is taking this bleed damage, they are also sickened 2 from the pain.

**Reset** Creatures can still fall into the trap once it has been exposed, but the camouflaged cover must be reset manually for the trap to become hidden again.
