# Maggot Pit<span class="item-type">Hazard 18</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 191. The Destiny War|Pathfinder #191: The Destiny War]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +0 (the maggots are slow and impossible to miss)
**Description** Countless human-faced, fanged maggots wriggle and squirm in this chamber.

---
**Disable** Three DC 45 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] checks within the room to utter prayers, which calm and quell the maggots with invocations to the gods
**AC** 39, **Fort** +27, **Ref** +33
**HP** 120 (BT 60); **Immunities** precision damage, **Weaknesses** area damage 15, good damage 15, splash damage 15, **Resistances** bludgeoning 10, piercing 20, slashing 20
**Damning Swarm** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (death, divine, necromancy) **Trigger** a creature appears in area **M1**; **Effect** The swarming maggots squirm into a biting frenzy, and all creatures on the ground in area **M1** must attempt a DC 40 Fortitude save. The hazard then rolls initiative.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes 1d10+5 piercing damage, 3d6 poison damage, and is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]].
**Failure** The creature takes 2d10+10 piercing damage, 6d6 poison damage, is sickened 1, and is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] by the maggots' bites.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 4d10+20 piercing damage, 12d6 poison damage, is sickened 1, and is enfeebled 2 by the maggots' bites.

**Routine** (2 actions; death, divine, necromancy) On its initiative, the pit uses its first action to use Damning Swarm against any creature within 5 feet of the pit floor. It then takes its second action to form a long, thrashing tendril composed of thousands of maggots to lash at a single target within area **M1**.
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> maggot tendril +35 (reach 200 feet); **Damage** 1d12+20 piercing and 2d12 poison (on a critical hit, the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Enfeebled|enfeebled 1]]; this has the poison trait)

---
**Reset** The pit functions continuously. If it's disabled or destroyed, it resets automatically after 24 hours if the crystal stele in area **M2** still functions, otherwise it doesn't reset.
