**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Dark Archive|Dark Archive]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** DC 25 (expert) to notice a slight tugging feeling
**Description** A supernatural compulsion to leap into the unknown exerts itself on anyone who approaches the ledge.

---
**Disable** DC 34 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] or DC 36 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] to expel the magical compulsion from the current island and from any of the red ropes directly attached to it, darkening the rope in color. The [[DATABASE/monster/K.H.W.'s Echo|Echo]] also automatically disables the hazard from any island he's standing on, and any of the red ropes directly attached to it, when he Reconstitutes from Thought on that island.
**Leap into the Unknown** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (enchantment, mental); **Trigger** A creature enters a square adjacent to the ledge of an island or steps onto one of the red ropes; **Effect** The call of the void tugs at the mind of intruders, compelling them to leap off the ledge. The creature must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or DC 32 [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] or else drop off the ledge. If the creature falls off, it drops 100 feet, loops through the closed space of the mindscape, and lands in the square it fell from, taking falling damage as normal (usually 50 bludgeoning damage). The call of the void then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) The call targets all creatures adjacent to a ledge or on one of the red ropes and tugs at their minds. A creature who has already fallen this round is immune.

---
**Reset** The call of the void persists as long as the Echo exists, though it doesn't activate until the Echo has rolled initiative. The hazard resets each day.
