**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] 2 for 1 minute. If not on its home plane, the creature is sent to a random location in the [[DATABASE/plane/Boneyard|Boneyard]] and can’t return to the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] until it receives permission to do so from a psychopomp of a higher level than the creature’s level.
