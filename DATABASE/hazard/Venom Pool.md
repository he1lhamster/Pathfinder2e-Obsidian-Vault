# Venom Pool<span class="item-type">Hazard 18</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 174. Shadows of the Ancients]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +30 (legendary) to distinguish between the hazard and the oozes within it; DC 0 to notice the pool
**Description** A shallow, foul-smelling puddle of toxic acid blocks a narrow hall, and poison bursts from it when disturbed.

---
**Disable** DC 40 [[Crafting]] (master) or DC 42 [[Survival]] (legendary) to neutralize the acid while within reach of it. Three successes using either skill (or a combination of both) destroys the hazard.
**Deadly Footing** The area of the venom pool is difficult terrain, and each creature moving through it takes 10 acid damage for every square of its area that it moves into.
**Poison Puff** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature moves through any square in the hazard's space; **Effect** The pool produces a 9th-level [[Cloudkill]] (DC 40) at its center. It then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (2 actions) The hazard uses its first action to spread 10 feet down the hallway in both directions. Once out of the hall, each side spreads in a random direction each round, but they don't go through doors. The hazard uses its second action to move the center of the _cloudkill_ up to 20 feet in any direction to which any part of the pool has line of effect (normally, to encompass the greatest number of characters). If the _cloudkill_ isn't present, it instead uses its second action to produce a new cloudkill, as Poison Puff.

---
**Reset** The hazard ends after 1 minute, contracting to its original size and keeping still until disturbed again.
