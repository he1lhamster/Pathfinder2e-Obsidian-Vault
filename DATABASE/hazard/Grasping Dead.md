# Grasping Dead<span class="item-type">Hazard 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +12 (expert)
**Description** Hands of the buried dead rise from the ground, grabbing and tearing at creatures in the area to drag them underground.

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (trained) to ritually pray for the dead or DC 24 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (trained) to exorcise the spirits' anger; two total successes are required to disable the haunt
**Shifting Earth** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** At least two creatures enter the area; **Effect** The earth shifts wildly as the hands of the dead spring forth from the ground. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures within the area are knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] unless they succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save. The haunt then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) The grasping hands batter all creatures in the area, dealing 2d6+7 bludgeoning damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature is dragged partially into the earth, becoming [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] until it [[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escapes]] (DC 26). If already immobilized, it's fully submerged and must hold its breath to avoid suffocation.

---
**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all living creatures leave the area. After 1 hour, the haunt reactivates.
