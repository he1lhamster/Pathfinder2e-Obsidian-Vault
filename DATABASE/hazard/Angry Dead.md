# Angry Dead<span class="item-type">Hazard 6</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 194. Cult of the Cave Worm]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +18 (expert)
**Description** The faces of the original dwarven inhabitants of the city appear in the stone and scream in anger.

---
**Disable** DC 23 [[Religion]] (trained) to ritually pray for the dead or DC 25 [[Occultism]] (trained) to exorcise the spirits' anger; a dwarf succeeds at a DC 22 [[Diplomacy]] or [[Intimidation]] check, asking or ordering the spirits to stand down.
**Howl of Agony** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (auditory) **Trigger** At least two living creatures step on the staircase; **Effect** Dozens of mouths open on the stairs and eastern wall doors of the chamber and howl in anger and misery. Creatures in the area are [[Deafened]] for 2 rounds and [[Frightened]] unless they succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save. Creatures who critically fail are deafened for 1 minute and frightened 3. The haunt then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) The faces continue to scream, dealing 5d6 sonic damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save) to all living creatures within 20 feet of the steps. On a critical failure, a creature takes double damage and is deafened for 1 round. Deaf creatures are immune to this effect.

---
**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 round after all living creatures leave the area. After 1 hour, the haunt reactivates. If the haunt is disabled by a dwarf succeeding at a Diplomacy or Intimidate check, the haunt is destroyed.
