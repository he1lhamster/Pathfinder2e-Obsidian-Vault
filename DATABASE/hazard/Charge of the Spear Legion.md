<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Crown of the Kobold King|Crown of the Kobold King]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 20 (expert)
**Description** When triggered, the room lurches suddenly on its side, causing those in the room to slide down toward the double line of spears on the west wall while the statues on the east slide down on a pulley-and-roller system to smash into the victims.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC 20 to deactivate the triggering pressure plate near the northern door
**Shift Sideways** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A Small or larger creature approaches within 15 feet of the double door to area D9. **Effect** The entire room rotates, its west half descending as its right half rises, forming a 45º slope down to the west. All creatures in the room fall prone and slide toward the west wall (a creature adjacent to the north or south wall can attempt to arrest this fall with a DC 20 check to [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]]) and take 2d6+5 piercing damage (DC 20 basic Reflex save) as they land among the spears. At the same time, the warhammer-wielding statues to the east slide downward on chains to smash into the lower wall; each person in the trap is subjected to a sliding statue Strike. 
**Melee** sliding statue +12, **Damage** 2d6+5 bludgeoning

**Reset** After 1 minute, the chamber rights itself and resets the trap.
