# Mana Whorl<span class="item-type">Hazard 7</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Impossible Lands|Impossible Lands]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +14 (trained) to identify as dangerous quicksand; +20 (expert) to recognize its magical properties
**Description** This 15-foot-wide patch of destabilized sand attempts to submerge creatures who wield magic. A desert tree with dense bright green foliage, pale pink blooms, and at least one carnivorous red-chested magpie is always nearby.

---
**Disable** DC 26 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] (expert) to feed magic into the whorl and temporarily stabilize it for a few minutes; feed the whorl a number of spellcasters and magic items with a combined 10 levels (for instance, a 4th-level cleric with two 3rd-level magic items) to stabilize it for 1 week; or feed the whorl a number of spellcasters and magic items with a combined 20 levels to stabilize it permanently. Spellcasters and magic items fed to the whorl are devoured whole.
**Submerge** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature who can cast spells, or who is wielding a magic item, walks into the mana whorl; **Effect** The triggering creature sinks into the whorl to its waist. The whorl rolls initiative if it hasn't already

---
**Routine** (1 action) On its initiative, the whorl pulls down any creature within it that can cast spells or that is wielding a magic item. A creature submerged to the waist becomes submerged to the neck, and a creature submerged to the neck is pulled under and must hold its breath to avoid suffocation. If a creature has no spells or magic items, the mana whorl is merely difficult terrain.
 A creature caught in a mana whorl can attempt a DC 23 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swim]] to either raise itself by one step if submerged to the neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if submerged only to the waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down by one step. A creature that Swims out of the whorl escapes the hazard and is prone in a space adjacent to the whorl. Other creatures can [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 23 Athletics check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check.
 If a creature has only magic items and no ability to cast spells, dropping all the items releases that creature, and it can move through the mana whorl as normal difficult terrain.

**Reset** The hazard continues to suck in anyone with magic until it is satiated (see Disable above). Magpies leave any satiated whorls.
