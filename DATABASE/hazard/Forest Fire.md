# Forest Fire<span class="item-type">Hazard 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span><span class="item-trait">Fire</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 176. Lost Mammoth Valley|Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** -10
**Description** A 10-foot-by-10-foot bonfire spreads to the surrounding forest on each of its turns.

---
**Disable** A successful DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]], [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] check from an adjacent square is sufficient to smother one 5-foot-square of fire; each attempt is an Interact action. Dousing the flames automatically extinguishes one or more sections of fire, with no check. Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as from a spell like [[DATABASE/spell/Create Water|create water]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Hydraulic Push|hydraulic push]]). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A [[DATABASE/equipment/Waterskin|waterskin]] doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is less effective than water, so a [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost Vial|frost vial]] puts out only 1 square of fire, and a [[DATABASE/spell/Ray of Frost|ray of frost]] is ineffective.
**Stoke Flames** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A [[DATABASE/monster/Brimorak (Arson Demon)|brimorak]] urges the fire to spread out of control; **Effect** The bonfire becomes a forest fire and rolls initiative.

**Routine** On its turn, the fire spreads into a number of additional squares equal to half the number of squares the fire currently occupies (minimum 1 square). You determine the squares the fire spreads into. Any creature that ends its turn next to the flames takes 2d8+5 fire damage, or 4d8+10 fire damage if it ended its turn within the flames (DC 25 basic Reflex save in either case). A creature can take damage from the forest fire only once per round.
