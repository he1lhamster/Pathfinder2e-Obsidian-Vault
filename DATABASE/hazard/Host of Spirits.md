# Host of Spirits<span class="item-type">Hazard 18</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 155. Lord of the Black Sands|Pathfinder #155: Lord of the Black Sands]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +35 (expert)
**Description** A host of angry spirits inhabiting the ruined house attempts to drag living creatures closer and crush them to death.

---
**Disable** DC 43 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (master) to exorcise the spirits or DC 45 [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] (master) to trick the spirits into departing
**Embrace of Death** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (attack, death, necromancy, occult) **Trigger** A creature that has angered the haunt begins its turn within 50 feet of the ruins of the house; **Effect** The haunt attempts a ghostly hand Strike against the target creature, and then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) For each of its actions, the trap attempts a ghostly hand Strike against a different creature within 50 feet of the ruins of the house (if there are fewer than 3 creatures, the haunt doesn't use its remaining actions).
 **Melee** ghostly hand +35, **Damage** 2d10+10 negative plus ghostly grip
 **Ghostly Grip** A creature outside the house that takes damage from the host of spirits' ghostly hand Strike must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save or be pulled directly into the house. If there is a wall in the creature's path, that section of wall is destroyed, and the creature takes an additional 3d12 bludgeoning damage. The haunt's ghostly hand Strike also deals an additional 6d6 bludgeoning damage to a target already inside the house (DC 42 basic Fortitude save).

---
**Reset** The haunt ends 1 round after no creatures are within 50 feet of the house. The haunt resets after 1 day
