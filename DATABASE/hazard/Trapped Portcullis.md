# Trapped Portcullis<span class="item-type">Hazard 11</span>

<span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** D 36 (master)
**Description** Two portcullises drop down to block progress through this area.

---
**Disable** DC 33 (master) to disable the trigger that causes the portcullises to drop
**AC** 30, **Fort** +24, **Ref** +18
**Portcullis Hardness** 18, **Portcullis HP** 72 (BT 36); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Drop from Ceiling** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A character enters a square between the two portcullises; **Effect** Both portcullises drop from the ceiling; attempting to lift one requires a DC 30 Athletics check to [[Force Open]]. When the portcullises drop, creatures in adjacent squares must attempt a DC 30 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unharmed and can take a [[Step]] as a reaction to move to an adjacent square.
**Success** As critical success, but the creature takes a glancing blow from the falling portcullis for 2d12+15 bludgeoning damage.
**Failure** The creature is struck by the falling portcullis for 4d12+30 bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[Prone]] in their square.
**Critical Failure** The creature is struck by the falling portcullis for 6d12+45 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is [[Immobilized]] by the portcullis as it pins them to the ground until they can [[Escape]] or [[Force Open]] the portcullis (DC 30).

**Reset** The trap can be manually reset with a 10-minute Manipulate activity performed in the hallways to the east or west of this area, as long as neither portcullis is broken or destroyed.
