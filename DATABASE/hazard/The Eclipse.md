# The Eclipse<span class="item-type">Hazard 19</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 192. Worst of All Possible Worlds|Pathfinder #192: Worst of All Possible Worlds]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +0 (trained)
**Description** The Eclipse is located high in the sky, manifesting as an eclipsed sun.

---
**Disable** reduce the Eclipse to 0 HP, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (10th level; counteract DC 39) to counteract the Eclipse (once it's in range)
**AC** 46, **Fort** +32, **Ref** +38
**Hardness** 32, **HP** 124 (BT 64); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Herald the End** **Trigger** The PCs arrive at the island; **Effect** A fiery point of light appears in the sky at the center of the Eclipse, swiftly growing in size as it becomes apparent that a meteor is hurtling toward the island. The Eclipse rolls initiative.

**Routine** (1 action) The Eclipse heals 50 points of damage, retreats upward from PCs if any have approached (as determined by its Distance Score), then unleashes a meteor down on the island below. The meteor explodes upon striking the island, creating a 30-foot radius burst that inflicts 8d6 fire and 4d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 41 basic Reflex save) to all creatures caught in the blast. The eclipse targets these strikes to catch as many PCs in the blast as it can each time—while it doesn't seek to damage a [[DATABASE/monster/Bul-Gae|bul-gae]], it won't worry about catching one or both in the area of effect if that spot is the most advantageous to striking the most possible PCs.
