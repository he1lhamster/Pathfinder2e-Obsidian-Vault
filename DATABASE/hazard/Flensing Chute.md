**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 173. Doorway to the Red Star|Pathfinder #173: Doorway to the Red Star]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 35 (master)
**Description** The stairs collapse into a downward spiral.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC 35 (master) to decouple several mechanisms barely accessible through gaps between the shifting risers, or Perception DC 38 to note which stairs have slightly different wear patterns to know which ones are safe to step on
**Change to Chute** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A Small or larger creature approaches within 20 feet of the top of the stairs; **Reaction** The stair risers shift downward, forming a steep ramp while exposing lines of razor-sharp blades. All creatures on the stairs must succeed at a DC 32 Reflex save or tumble down the chute, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage, 4d12+26 slashing damage, and landing prone in area A4.
