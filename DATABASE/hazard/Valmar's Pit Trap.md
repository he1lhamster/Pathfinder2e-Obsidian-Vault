**Stealth** DC 25 (expert)
**Description** The ground here is made of loosely packed soil that, when stepped upon, collapses.

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] (trained) to reinforce the dirt so it's safe to walk on, or DC 18 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to collapse the trap from a safe distance.
**AC** 10, **Fort** +2, **Ref** +3
**Hardness** 1, **HP** 6 (BT 3); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Collapse** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature steps onto any space in the dotted area on the map, or at least 30 pounds of pressure is put on the area; **Effect** The ground gives way. The triggering creature falls 20 feet down the hole, taking 10 bludgeoning damage and landing prone in area **E10**. A creature can [[DATABASE/action/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] to avoid falling.
