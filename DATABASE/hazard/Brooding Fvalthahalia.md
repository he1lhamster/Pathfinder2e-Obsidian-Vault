# Brooding Fvalthahalia<span class="item-type">Hazard 13</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Shadows at Sundown|Shadows at Sundown]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 37 (master)
**Description** Tiny black flames mirror living creatures' movements in the city above as scraps of shadow patrol the streets—flames that notice intruders in their “sky” below and reach out to the intruders "above" with a deafening violence that incidentally alerts several of the vault's denizens to the intruders' presence.

**Disable** DC 40 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (master) to adjust the model so its attention is focused inward, DC 37 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (expert) to cause the accumulated psychic energy to discharge harmlessly, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (7th level; counteract DC 32). A character who sneaks through the room with a DC 32 [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] (expert) check avoids triggering the hazard, but this does not disable it.
**Call of Fvalthahalia** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (abjuration, occult) **Trigger** A creature without supernatural ties to the [[DATABASE/plane/Shadow Plane|Shadow Plane]] enters the room (creatures like [[DATABASE/ancestry/Fetchling|fetchlings]] or divine spellcasters who worship [[DATABASE/deity/Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthon]] represent two examples of creatures who won't trigger this hazard); **Effect** The flickering dark flames on the city's streets flare up and the sound of an entire city populace screaming an alarm fills the room. All creatures in area C1 take 18d6 sonic damage (DC 33 basic Fortitude save), and all strigoi from Aliriel's Vault immediately know intruders have been spotted in this room. Any strigoi in area C2 quickly investigate and attack the PCs on sight.
