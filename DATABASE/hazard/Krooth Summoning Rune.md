**Summon Monster** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (arcane, conjuration, summon) **Trigger** A non-[[Xulgath]], non-[[Demon]] creature that isn't carrying a [[Religious Symbol]] of [[Zevgavizeb]] crosses from the north part of the hall to the south part of the hall; **Effect** The trap summons a [[Krooth]]. The krooth rolls initiative and remains for 2d6 rounds, after which the spell ends and the krooth disappears. The krooth also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires.
