# Hall of Fiery Doom<span class="item-type">Hazard 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 177. Burning Tundra|Pathfinder #177: Burning Tundra]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +32 (master)
**Description** While the roof is on fire and collapsing timbers crush those within the hall, demons fly down from the sky to pluck victims from the flames.

---
**Disable** two DC 32 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks to douse the flames; Athletics to do the work yourself or Diplomacy to muster the ghostly soldiers. This reduces the hazard's actions by 1 and prevents it from using Burning Timbers. Banish the demons with up to two DC 35 [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] checks; each success reduces the hazard's actions by 1, and two successes prevent it from using Demonic Abduction. When the hazard loses all 3 actions, Burning Timbers, and Demonic Abduction, it's disabled.
**Burst of Fire** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature enters the hall or ends its turn in the hall; **Effect** The hall bursts into flame, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each creature in the hall. The haunt then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) The haunt spends 1 action to fill the hall with burning timbers falling from above, and 2 actions to pluck up random victims and drop them to their deaths.
 **Burning Timbers** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Creatures within the 30-foot by 90-foot area of the hall take 4d6+12 fire damage (DC 29 basic Reflex save).
 **Demonic Abduction** <span class="action-icon">1</span> Spectral demons lift a single creature 50 feet into the air and drop it. The haunt makes a Strike against the creature with a +23 attack bonus. On a success, the creature is lifted into the air and dropped, taking 25 bludgeoning damage, though it might negate some or all this damage using a spell, such as [[DATABASE/spell/Feather Fall|feather fall]]. On a critical hit, the creature also takes 2d12+13 slashing damage as the demons' claws tear through its flesh.

**Reset** The hall falls quiet for 24 hours, after which it can trigger again.
