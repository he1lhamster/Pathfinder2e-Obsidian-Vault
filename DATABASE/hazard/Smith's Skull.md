# Smith's Skull<span class="item-type">Hazard 18</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 191. The Destiny War]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 42 (master) to see the skull's lower jaws start to open
**Description** The smith's skull gazes with fiery light and breathes in a deep breath.

---
**Disable** DC 48 [[Athletics]] (master) to hold the skull's jaw shut, or DC 45 [[Occultism]] or [[Religion]] (expert) to quiet the Smith's spirit
**Smith's Inhalation** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) **Trigger** A creature who can see the Smith's skull approaches within 20 feet; **Effect** The skull's eyes flare. Each non-storykin creature within 60 feet who can see the skull is subjected to an overwhelming feeling of being sucked into it, and must attempt a DC 40 Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature feels pain across its body, as if the skull's inhalation were pulling the skin from its bones. The creature becomes [[Sickened]] and takes 8d6 mental damage.
**Failure** The creature is convinced that the skull just “breathed in” its skin, and it takes 16d6 mental damage. The overwhelming pain leaves the creature [[Slowed]] for 1 round as well.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but 24d6 mental damage and the creature is [[Stunned]] from the pain.
