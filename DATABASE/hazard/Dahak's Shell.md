**Description** A ring of eight dragon pillar replicas mark the border of a dome of magical prismatic energy that entirely contains the Fortress of Sorrow.

---
**Disable** Each [[DATABASE/hazard/Dragon Pillar|dragon pillar]] that is destroyed removes the corresponding color's effect from Dahak's shell; as long as even one color remains active, the pillars marking the shell's border cannot be damaged themselves, but a successful DC 32 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (master) check or a successful [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (6th level; counteract DC 30) against one of the eight pillars can cause a randomly determined active color in the shell defense (below) to become deactivated for 1d4 rounds.
**Shell Defense** (abjuration, divine, light) When a creature physically passes through the shell, the creature is affected simultaneously by all colors of energy currently active in the shell; apply these effects in the following order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, black. These effects are the same as that of the eye beams described on the [[DATABASE/hazard/Dragon Pillar|dragon pillar hazard]], but with a save DC of 32. Each effect requires its own save.
**Prismatic Beam** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (abjuration, divine, light); **Trigger** a creature attempts and fails to disable one of the shell colors via Thievery or dispel magic; **Effect** Dahak's shell Strikes the triggering creature with a random eye beam. Roll 1d8 to determine the color (1–red, 2–orange, 3–yellow, 4–green, 5–blue, 6–indigo, 7–violet, 8–black).
 **Ranged** <span class="action-icon">1</span> eye beam +20 (range 120 feet), **Effect** The target suffers an effect corresponding to the eye beam's color, as described on the [[DATABASE/hazard/Dragon Pillar|dragon pillar hazard]], but with a save DC of 32. On a critical hit, the target's save result is one degree worse.
