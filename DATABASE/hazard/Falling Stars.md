# Falling Stars<span class="item-type">Hazard 15</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 190. The Choosing|Pathfinder #190: The Choosing]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 40 (master)
**Description** Pressure plates in the floor cause crystal-tipped spikes to rain down into the room and explode.

---
**Disable** DC 40 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (master) to disable enough pressure plates so the trap won't trigger
**Rain of Stars** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Each time a non-flying creature enters a square in this room, roll a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the trap triggers as the character steps on a pressure plate—the trap automatically triggers if a creature steps on either square just west of the hallway leading to **H12**; **Effect** The trap makes a crystal spike Strike against all creatures in the room, then each creature in the room takes 6d10 piercing damage as the spikes explode (DC 36 basic Reflex save).
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> crystal spike +34, **Damage** 2d12+26 piercing

---
**Reset** The trap's supply of spikes magically replenishes, and the trap resets after 1 hour.
