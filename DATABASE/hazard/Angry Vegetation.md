# Angry Vegetation<span class="item-type">Hazard 20</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Environmental</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 156. The Apocalypse Prophet|Pathfinder #156: The Apocalypse Prophet]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** DC 42 (master) to notice massive buds beneath the other foliage before they open
**Description** Five large flowers in the weed-choked field unfurl, each dusting pollen onto vines that animate into wemmuths.

---
**Disable** DC 48 [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] (master) or DC 48 [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] (legendary) to calm a flower, closing it
**AC** 37, **Fort** +33, **Ref** +30, **Will** +30
**HP** 120 per flower; **Immunities** mental, **Weaknesses** fire 20
**Bloom** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A non-plant creature enters the garden; **Effect** The blooms open, spawning a single [[DATABASE/monster/Wemmuth|wemmuth]] that acts on the hazard's initiative, and the hazard rolls for initiative.

---
**Routine** (2 actions) If there are fewer wemmuths than open flowers, the flowers create more wemmuths (so there as many wemmuths as open flowers) as their first action. For their second action, the flowers produce a mind-addling pollen. Each non-plant creature within 30 feet of a flower must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] for 1 round (or [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] for 1 round, on a critical failure). The pollen is an emotion, mental, and olfactory effect.

---
**Reset** Wemmuths collapse into ordinary vines and the trap resets if the area is left alone for 1 minute.
