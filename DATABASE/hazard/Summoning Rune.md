# Summoning Rune<span class="item-type">Hazard 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 157. Devil at the Dreaming Palace]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +11 (trained)
**Description** A summoning circle inlaid into the room's floor detects living creatures and summons a violent [[Devil]].

---
**Disable** DC 18 Perception to notice the trap's magic and avoid stepping on the floor outside the circle, followed by DC 21 [[Thievery]] (trained) to break the circle or [[Dispel Magic]] (3rd level; counteract DC 23) to counteract the rune
**Summon Devil** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (arcane, conjuration, summon) **Trigger** A living creature steps on any part of the floor not enclosed by the summoning circle; **Effect** One round after a creature touches the triggering area, the door to the room slams shut and locks (two DC 20 Thievery checks to pick) and a [[Barbazu (Bearded Devil)]] devil appears in the summoning circle. The devil rolls initiative and remains for 3d6 rounds, after which the spell ends and the devil disappears. The devil also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned devil can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.

---
**Reset** The trap resets each day at dawn.
