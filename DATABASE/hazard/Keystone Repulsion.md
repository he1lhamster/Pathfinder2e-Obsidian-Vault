<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 186. Ghost King's Rage|Pathfinder #186: Ghost King's Rage]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +51 (legendary)
**Description** Four magic keystones repel creatures when one is damaged or tampered with.

---
**Disable** DC 48 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (legendary) to remove each keystone or DC 48 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (legendary) to manipulate the magic to isolate each keystone
**Repel** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (force, occult) **Trigger** A creature damages or tampers with a keystone; **Effect** The triggering creature is moved back 10 feet by a wave of force. A successful DC 42 Fortitude save reduces the distance moved to 5 feet. The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each removed or isolated keystone. Each keystone spends 1 action to release a wave of force, dealing 4d10+22 force damage in a 15-foot cone (DC 42 basic Reflex save) and pushing each creature back 5 feet. On a failed save, the distance a creature is pushed increases to 10 feet.
