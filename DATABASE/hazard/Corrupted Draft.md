<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Curse</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/The Enmity Cycle|The Enmity Cycle]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +16 (expert) or [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]]
**Description** Discordant music, dance, and poetry combine to build a deep suspicion and distrust of strangers.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] DC 28 to counteract the performance or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] or Occult DC 28 to disrupt the spiritual energy. Two total successes are needed to disable the trap. The mechanical head can automatically disable the trap with two uses of Inspired Recitation.
**Sickening Performance** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (emotion, mental, occult) **Trigger** Two or more characters enter area **E3** and make any sound at all; **Effect** Sounds or speech are amplified and garbled into a terrible, shrieking cry. All creatures in the area take 2d10+11 mental damage (DC 28 basic Will save). The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action; emotion, fear, mental, occult) The echoes continue to reverberate, tearing at those in the area and filling them with distrust of others. All creatures in the area take 2d10+11 mental damage and must attempt a DC 28 Will save.
 **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is immune to the effects for 1 minute.
 **Success** The target takes half damage.
 **Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] by feelings of distrust and anxiety.
 **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is sickened 2.

---
**Reset** The hazard stops when there are no conscious creatures in area **E3** and resets after 1 minute.
