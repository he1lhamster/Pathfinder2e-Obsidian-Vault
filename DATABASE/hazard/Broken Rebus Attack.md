# Broken Rebus Attack<span class="item-type">Hazard 12</span>

<span class="trait-unique item-trait">Unique</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 166. Despair on Danger Island|Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +20 (trained)
**Description** Ghostly attackers knock the tables about, send dishes flying, and pull fleeing creatures into the room.

---
**Disable** DC 34 [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (expert) to say an [[DATABASE/deity/Irori|Iroran]] prayer and put the haunt temporarily to rest, DC 38 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] (master) to create a ward against future hauntings
**Ghostly Pull** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** One round passes since a creature entered the refectory; **Effect** A Broken Rebus monk grabs the creature and yanks them toward the room's center. The triggering creature must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save. The haunt can use this reaction any number of times per round, but only once per creature that tries to leave the room. The haunt then rolls initiative, if it hasn't already.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is pulled 10 feet into the room.
**Failure** The creature is pulled 15 feet into the room.
**Critical Failure** The creature is pulled 15 feet into the room, knocked [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]], and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

---
**Routine** (1 action) The haunt sends a flurry of objects hurtling across the room. All creatures in the room are battered by the ghostly objects, taking 3d10+14 force damage (DC 32 basic Reflex save).

---
**Reset** The haunt deactivates after 1 minute. It re-forms at the same times every day, 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., which is when the monks had their morning and evening meals. If at least two people cook a meal in the kitchen, share a meal in the refectory, and utter a prayer to Irori before the meal, the haunt becomes permanently disabled and doesn't re-form.
