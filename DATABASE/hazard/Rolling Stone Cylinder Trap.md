**Stealth** DC 28 (trained)
**Description** A 10-foot-long, 5-foot-thick column of stone thuds to the ground, just in front of the bridge. It immediately starts to roll down the bridge, quickly picking up speed.

---
**Disable** DC 25 [[Thievery]] check to create a wedge to immobilize the column, DC 21 [[Athletics]] check to immobilize the column until the end of the creature's next turn, a creature can [[Climb]] over an immobilized column with a successful DC 18 Athletics check.
**AC** 21, **Fort** +18, **Ref** +11
**Hardness** 14, **HP** 58 (29); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Drop and Roll** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A lever at the top of the south tower is pulled; **Effect** A thick column of stone drops from above the gate, then uses crushing roll. The rolling stone cylinder trap rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) The rolling stone cylinder trap uses Crushing Roll.
 **Crushing Roll** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Requirements** The rolling stone cylinder is not [[Immobilized]]; **Effect** The rolling stone cylinder trap moves its Speed west along the bridge. Creatures it moves past or lands on take 5d6 bludgeoning damage and are forced to move west to the first available space (DC 27 basic Reflex). Creatures who critically succeed at the Reflex save are not damaged but are still moved west. If the rolling stone tries to move into a non-creature obstruction, such as a wall or barricade, it deals bludgeoning damage to the obstruction and only continues moving if the obstruction is destroyed, otherwise the trap stops.
