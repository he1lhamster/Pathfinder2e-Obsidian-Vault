# Gloomglow Mushrooms<span class="item-type">Hazard 5</span>

<span class="item-trait">Environmental</span><span class="item-trait">Fungus</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 145. Hellknight Hill]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 26 (expert)
**Description** A field of grass-like fungal filaments amid clusters of softly glowing, long-stalked mushrooms

---
**Disable** [[Survival]] DC 22 (expert) to remove a 5-foot-patch without triggering the mushrooms.
**AC** 21, **Fort** +13, **Ref** +9
**HP** 52; **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage, **Weaknesses** cold 10
**Glowing Spores** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature moves into the mushrooms' space or damages the mushrooms. The mushrooms can't use this reaction if the damage was cold damage. **Effect** The triggering creature and all creatures within 10 feet are sprayed with itchy, distracting, glowing spores and must attempt a DC 22 Reflex save. On a failed save, the creatures become [[Sickened]] and [[Stupefied]] (or sickened 2 and stupefied 2 on a critical failure) and take a –4 penalty to [[Stealth]] checks until the spores lose potency in 24 hours or are removed. This requires washing them off by bathing in water for a minute, a [[Prestidigitation]] spell, or a similar measure allowed by the GM.
