<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span><span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 147. Tomorrow Must Burn]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +17
**Description** Hell hounds invisible to all but their lone target burn their chosen victim.

---
**Disable** [[Religion]] DC 24 (expert) to perform an exorcism (with 2 actions)
**Begin the Hunt** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (conjuration, occult); **Trigger** A creature that doesn't openly wear the symbol of [[Asmodeus]] comes within 60 feet of the haunt's initial location. **Effect** The hounds appear before the chosen target and begin to chase that creature, howling wildly. The haunt rolls initiative. Others cannot see or hear this baying and must [[Seek]] to determine the hounds' location.

---
**Routine** (2 actions) The haunt uses its first action to Stride, then its second action for a jaws Strike against its designated target if it is in reach. If the target is not in reach, the haunt resets.
 **Speed** 60 feet
 **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws +20 (magical), **Damage** 1d10+11 piercing plus 1d10 fire

---
**Reset** If their designated target dies or the hounds can't reach it in a turn, the hounds vanish into noxious smoke, but they manifest again elsewhere in the city after the next sunset.
