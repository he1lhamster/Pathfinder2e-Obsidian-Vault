**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 190. The Choosing|Pathfinder #190: The Choosing]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** 0 (initiative modifier is +28)
**Description** Flames engulf the opera house's stage.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] DC 27 to extinguish two adjacent squares of fire (with a critical success extinguishing four adjacent squares); any water spell (such as from [[DATABASE/spell/Create Water|create water]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Hydraulic Push|hydraulic push]]) cast at the fire extinguishes two squares automatically, or 2d4 adjacent squares if the caster of the spell achieves a DC 30 result with a spell attack roll; [[DATABASE/spell/Quench|quench]] instantly extinguishes all fire within its 20-foot burst.
**Erupt in Flame** When this encounter begins, the fire erupts in a ring that encircles the entire stage, as shown by the dotted outline on the map. The stage fire then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** On its turn, the stage fire expands inward and outward by 5 feet, filling all adjacent squares with fire. Creatures within these squares take 4d6 fire damage (DC 30 basic Reflex save), as do any creatures that enter a burning square. This fire damage can be inflicted on a creature only once per turn.
In addition, a creature that ends its turn in a burning square takes 8d6 fire damage (DC 30 basic Reflex save); on a failed save, that creature also takes 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent fire damage]]
