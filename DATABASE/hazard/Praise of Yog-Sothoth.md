# Praise of Yog-Sothoth<span class="item-type">Hazard 19</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +37 (legendary) to recognize the symbols as a magical trap
**Description** Magical letters reveal phrases in Aklo that, if not properly spoken aloud, inflict numbing cold.

---
**Disable** DC 47 Occultism (master) or DC 49 Religion (master) three times in a row to successfully speak aloud the esoteric phrases as they appear (this causes the trap to deactivate for 1 hour, although the phrases continue to appear during this time), or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (9th level, counteract DC 38).
**Reactive Charge** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (arcane, [[DATABASE/equipment/Cat|evocation]]) **Trigger** A creature spends more than 1 round in the room without speaking aloud the phrases appearing in the alcove. **Effect** The creature takes 12d6 cold damage (DC 41 basic Fortitude save, plus immobilized for 1 minute on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action) The trap fills the entirety of area **B4** with additional blasts of cold. All creatures in area **B4** take 12d6 cold damage (DC **41** basic Fortitude save, plus [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilized]] for 1 minute on a critical failure).

---
**Reset** The trap deactivates 1 round after it has no target creatures and resets after 1 minute.
