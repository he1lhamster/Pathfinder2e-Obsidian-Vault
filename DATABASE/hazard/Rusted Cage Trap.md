# Rusted Cage Trap<span class="item-type">Hazard 1</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Rusthenge]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 17
**Description** A rusty cage embedded in the ceiling drops down with a clang to try to entrap a creature that steps onto the pressure plate in the middle of the room.

---
**Disable** DC 13 [[Thievery]] to harmlessly trigger the trap by nudging the pressure plate, DC 20 Thievery to stabilize the pressure plate so it doesn't trigger, or DC 20 [[Athletics]] to [[Escape]] from the cage or [[Force Open]] the cage once it falls
**AC** 16, **Fort** +10, **Ref** +4
**Cage Hardness** 5, **HP** 24 (BT 12); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Slam Down** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A creature walks under the cage and steps on the pressure plate; **Effect** The cage drops from the ceiling to trap the triggering creature, who must attempt a DC 17 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The creature avoids the trap, and returns to the space it just left rather than entering the trap's space.
**Success** As Critical Success, but the falling trap delivers a glancing blow and 1d6+3 bludgeoning damage to the creature as it stumbles back.
**Failure** The falling trap lands on the triggering creature. A Medium or smaller creature becomes trapped inside the cage (Escape DC 20). A Large or larger creature takes 2d6+5 bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[Prone]] as the cage bounces off the creature's body, becoming destroyed in the process.
**Critical Failure** As Failure, but a Medium or smaller creature is also struck by the cage, knocked prone, and then takes 2d6+5 bludgeoning damage and is immobilized by the cage as it lands on a limb.
