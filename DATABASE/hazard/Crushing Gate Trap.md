# Crushing Gate Trap<span class="item-type">Hazard 16</span>

<span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 155. Lord of the Black Sands]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 42 (master) to spot the triggering rod beneath the black sand
**Description** A hidden stone rod causes two immense stone doors to fall forward from their gate, crushing anything beneath them. The doors also fall forward if touched.

---
**Disable** [[Thievery]] DC 42 (expert) to secure the doors in place without triggering the trap
**AC** 40, **Fort** +32, **Ref** +25
**Hardness** 26, **HP** 104 (BT 52); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Gate Collapse** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (attack) **Trigger** The stone rod is moved or either door is touched; **Effect** The two falling doors deal 6d12+35 bludgeoning damage (DC 37 basic Reflex save) to all creatures within 15 feet of the gate. On a failure, a creature is also pinned beneath the door and [[Immobilized]] until the door is moved (DC 34 [[Athletics]]) or destroyed; each door has the same AC, Fortitude save, Hardness, and Hit Points as the trap itself. On a critical failure, the creature is trapped in such a way that it can't attempt to free itself. Moving or destroying one door doesn't help free anyone trapped by the other door.
