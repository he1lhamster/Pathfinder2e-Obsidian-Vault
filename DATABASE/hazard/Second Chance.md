<span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 44 (legendary)
**Description** Powerful warding magic tied to an object or location tries to regress the ages of a creature and its allies.

---
**Disable** [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] DC 46 (legendary) to take apart the spell one tiny piece at a time, with eyes closed, while recalling every vivid life memory in order, starting from the earliest memory
**In the Beginning** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, transmutation); **Trigger** A creature tries to steal the object or intrude upon the location. If someone uses a proxy or dupe for the theft or intrusion, the trap unerringly targets the true perpetrator or perpetrators at any distance—even across planes. **Effect** The triggering creature and up to five coconspirators instantly revert to infants, losing all memories, class abilities, and other skills acquired during their lives (DC 44 Fortitude negates). Reversing this effect is nearly impossible, requiring powerful magic such as [[DATABASE/spell/Wish|wish]].
