# Avalanche Doors<span class="item-type">Hazard 4</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Crown of the Kobold King|Crown of the Kobold King]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 22 (expert)
**Description** The double door is a false door; when triggered, the door slams downward like a drawbridge to crush anyone standing before it.

---
**Disable** DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to detach the trigger from the doors and lock them in place
**AC** 21, **Fort** +14, **Ref** +8
**Hardness** 11, **HP** 50 (BT 25); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Topple Forward** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** Someone attempts to open the doors, or the doors take enough damage to become broken; **Effect** The heavy metal doors are spring-loaded to slam downward, dropping like a drawbridge to smash all creatures in a 10-foot-square before the doors. All creatures in this area must attempt a DC 21 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The creature lurches to the side and takes no damage—move the creature to a square of the creature's choice adjacent to the trap's area of effect.
**Success** The creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed into an adjacent square just outside the trap's area.
**Failure** The creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is pushed into an adjacent square just outside the trap's area, and falls [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] in that square.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes 12d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. The heavy doors pin the creature to the ground, [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|Immobilizing]] it ([[DATABASE/action/Escape|Escape]] DC 22). A non-immobilized character can lift the doors by [[DATABASE/action/Force Open|Forcing them open]] with a successful DC 22 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check so that an immobilized character can crawl to safety.
