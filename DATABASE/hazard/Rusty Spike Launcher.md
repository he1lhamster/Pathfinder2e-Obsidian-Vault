<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rusthenge|Rusthenge]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 20 (trained)
**Description** As the large rusty door swings open, a mass of rusty spikes appear out of nowhere in the open doorway and launch violently into the room.

---
**Disable** DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] to decouple the triggering rods that cause the spikes to extend, or [[DATABASE/spell/Dispel Magic|dispel magic]] (2nd level; counteract DC 18) to counteract the trap
**Launch Spikes** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** a creature opens the door without uttering a prayer to Xar-Azmak first; **Effect** A mass of rusty spikes appears in the open doorway and then fire into area **E1**. The rusty spikes curve through the air to seek targets—all creatures in area **E1** must attempt a DC 20 Reflex save.
**Critical Success** The creature avoids the spikes and takes no damage.
**Success** A spike grazes the creature, inflicting 2d10 piercing damage.
**Failure** A spike impales the creature, inflicting 2d10+13 piercing damage.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the spike also exposes the creature to [[DATABASE/disease/Tetanus|tetanus]].

**Reset** The trap automatically resets once the door is closed.
