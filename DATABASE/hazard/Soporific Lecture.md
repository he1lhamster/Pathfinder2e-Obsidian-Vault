# Soporific Lecture<span class="item-type">Hazard 8</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Mechanical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 189. Dreamers of the Nameless Spires|Pathfinder #189: Dreamers of the Nameless Spires]]
**Complexity** Simple
**Stealth** DC 28 (expert)
**Description** Several hidden nozzles spray colorless sleeping gas into the seating area.

---
**Disable** DC 28 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (expert) to crimp shut the primary feeding tube for the gas, or DC 31 Perception (expert) to discover the hidden bypass switch next to the door to area **A3** that shuts the trap off
**Gas Spray** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (incapacitation, mental, poison, sleep) **Trigger** Pressure is applied to any of the steps in the middle of the seating area, or applied to the manual trigger on the stage. This manual trigger can activate the trap even if its hidden bypass switch is engaged; **Effect** Sleeping gas is silently sprayed into the seating area. All creatures in the area must roll a DC 26 Will save to resist its effects. The gas persists in the area for 3 rounds before becoming inert. Any creature who ends their turn in this area during these 3 rounds must attempt a new DC 26 Will save.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and realizes that the area has been gassed.
**Success** The creature is unaffected but doesn't notice the gas.
**Failure** The creature feels a bit drowsy and lethargic, and becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute. If the creature is already fatigued, it instead falls [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]]. If it's still unconscious after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.
**Critical Failure** The creature falls unconscious. If it's still unconscious after 1 hour, it wakes up automatically.
