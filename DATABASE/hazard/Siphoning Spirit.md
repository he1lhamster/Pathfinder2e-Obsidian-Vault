# Siphoning Spirit<span class="item-type">Hazard 19</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Haunt</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +40 (trained)
**Description** A formless spirit drains life from the living, becoming progressively visible as its victims weaken.

---
**Disable** DC 48 [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] (expert) to weaken the spirit; four total successes are required to disable the haunt
**Sudden Siphon** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (divine, necromancy, negative) **Trigger** A living creature passes within 15 feet of the spirit; **Effect** The invisible spirit latches onto the life essence of the living, dealing 4d10+20 negative damage to all living creatures within 60 feet (DC 41 basic Fortitude save). The haunt then rolls initiative.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and increases its [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained]] value by 1, to a maximum of drained 4.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and increases its drained value by 2, to a maximum of drained 4. If the creature was already drained 4, it dies.

---
**Routine** (1 action; death, divine, necromancy, negative) The spirit inhales, siphoning the souls of the living and becoming more visible. Each creature within 60 feet takes 4d10+20 negative damage, with a DC 41 Fortitude save. If no creatures are within the area, the haunt moves up to 120 feet into the largest concentration of living creatures and then inhales.

---
**Reset** After 1 minute, the spirit is satiated, and the haunt deactivates as it returns to a resting state. Over the course of 1 hour, the spirit's siphoned life energy disperses and the haunt resets.
