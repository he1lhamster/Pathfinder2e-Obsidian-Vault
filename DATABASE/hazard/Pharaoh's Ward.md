**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Complexity** Simple

**Disable** [[Thievery]] DC 27 (master) to painstakingly remove the lintel without triggering the magic, or [[Dispel Magic]] (4th level; counteract DC 25) to counteract the rune
**Curse the Intruders** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (curse, divine, necromancy); **Trigger** The seal on the tomb is broken from the outside. **Effect** Each living creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be subjected to the pharaoh’s curse. A cursed creature takes a –2 status penalty to Fortitude saves, and any natural or magical healing it receives is halved. The curse remains until removed by [[Remove Curse]] or similar magic.
