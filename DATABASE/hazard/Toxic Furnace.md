<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Crown of the Kobold King|Crown of the Kobold King]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** +15 (expert)
**Description** The smoking furnace begins to hiss and click, and its vents swivel and adjust to spew toxic fumes in the direction of intruders.

---
**Disable** DC 25 [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to render one of the vents useless, or DC 25 [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] to wrench and bend a vent until it no longer functions
**AC** 24, **Fort** +17, **Ref** +11
**Vent Hardness** 10, **Vent HP** 18 (BT 9); **Furnace Hardness** 15, **Furnace HP** 56 (BT 28); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
**Spew Toxins** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Trigger** A visible living creature enters the room, or a Stealthy creature fails to remain [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from the toxic furnace with a DC 25 [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check (the trap's sensors have [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]] and [[DATABASE/monsterability/Lifesense|lifesense]]); **Effect** One of the toxic furnace's vents swivels to aim at the triggering creature and then spews a gout of boiling toxin at the target. The toxic furnace then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (3 actions) The trap loses 1 action for each disabled vent. On each of the trap's actions, a vent spews a gout of boiling toxin at a living creature in sight of it. It can't target a single creature more than once per round, so if there aren't enough viable targets for all 3 actions, the trap loses those unspent actions.
 **Ranged** boiling toxin +17 (range 30 feet), **Damage** 1d6 acid, 2d6 fire, and 2d6 poison

---
**Reset** The trap resets after 1 minute, during which it sees no creatures to target.
