# Eldritch Echoes<span class="item-type">Hazard 20</span>

<span class="item-trait">Complex</span><span class="item-trait">Magical</span><span class="item-trait">Trap</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
**Complexity** Complex
**Stealth** DC +38 (master) to realize that the strange faint sounds could be dangerous.
**Description** Those who listen to the sounds for too long become convinced that these forces can be defeated by lashing out at them, even though the forces themselves are not apparent.

---
**Disable** DC 42 Performance (master) to counter the eerie sounds by exceeding their influence with a virtuoso act, or DC 48 Intimidation (master) to startle the echoes into silence with a display of anger and rage.
**Distort Senses** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (auditory, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) **Trigger** At least two creatures who aren't native to Thousandbreaths end their turn in area **K13**. **Effect** Those in the room begin “hearing” the sounds in the room telepathically and start to have difficulty telling the difference between these sounds and those of their allies; the trap then rolls initiative.

---
**Routine** (1 action; emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) The trap starts scrambling senses and forcing creatures to perceive threats to their very place in time and space where no such threats actually exist. Every creature in area **K13** must attempt a DC 42 Will saving throw. Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
 Success The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied]] 1 for 1 round.
 **Failure** As success, but the creature is also [[DATABASE/condition/Confused|confused]] as long as it remains stupefied.
 **Critical Failure** The creature is stupefied 2 and confused. The confused condition persists until the creature recovers normally, but the stupefaction effect is permanent until removed.
