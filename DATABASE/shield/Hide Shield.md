Hide shields come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Specialized tanning techniques combined with tough hides from creatures such as [[Owlbear]] result in these particularly tough shields. The hardened hide of the shield still has enough flexibility to diminish the impact of battering and pummeling attacks.
