**Requirements** You have diplomatic relations (page 534) with the group you wish to establish an agreement with.

---
You send a band of merchants out to establish a trade agreement between your kingdom and a group with whom you've established diplomatic relations. If a navigable river connects your kingdom with the other group's territory, you can attempt a Boating check to Establish the Trade Agreement. If your kingdom's proficiency rank in Magic is Master or higher, you can attempt a Magic check. Otherwise, attempt a Trade check.
 The check's DC is either the group's Negotiation DC (see sidebar) or your kingdom's Control DC, whichever is higher.
**Critical Success** You successfully establish a trade agreement with your target, and your merchants return with gifts! Immediately roll 2 Resource Dice, then gain RP equal to the result of roll.
**Success** You successfully establish a trade agreement.
**Failure** Your traders reach their destination but need to sweeten the deal to secure the trade agreement. Immediately roll 2 Resource Dice, and then spend RP equal to the result of this roll. If you do so, you successfully establish a trade agreement, otherwise the attempt fails.
**Critical Failure** Your trade agreement is a total loss and your traders do not return. Gain 1 Unrest, and until the end of the next Kingdom turn, take a –1 circumstance penalty to all Economy-related checks.
