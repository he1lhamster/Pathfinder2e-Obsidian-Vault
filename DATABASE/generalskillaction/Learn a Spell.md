**Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition’s spell list.

You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were a [[DATABASE/class_/Cleric|cleric]] with the [[DATABASE/archetype/Barbarian|bard multiclass archetype]], you couldn't use [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire. 
To learn the spell, you must do the following:

* Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession. 
* Have materials with the Price indicated in Table 4–3. 
* Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close to the DC on Table 4–3). Uncommon or rare spells have higher DCs.

If you have a [[DATABASE/equipment/Spellbook (Blank)|spellbook]], Learning a Spell lets you add the spell to your spellbook; if you prepare spells from a list, it's added to your list; if you have a spell repertoire, you can select it when you add or swap spells.
