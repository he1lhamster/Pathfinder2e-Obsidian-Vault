# Tap Ley Line (Trained)

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
You can use your magical prowess to temporarily access the power of a ley line. Tapping the Ley Line requires a skill check using the skill associated with its tradition ([[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] for arcane, [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] for primal, [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] for occult, and [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] for divine). In cases where a ley line has multiple associated traditions, you can use any of the appropriate skills to Tap the Ley Line. The benefits of a ley line are always magical in nature and can be counteracted in a similar way to a magic item.
