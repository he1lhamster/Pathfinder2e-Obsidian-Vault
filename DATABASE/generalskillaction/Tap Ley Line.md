# Tap Ley Line (Trained)

**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
You can use your magical prowess to temporarily access the power of a ley line. Tapping the Ley Line requires a skill check using the skill associated with its tradition ([[Arcana]] for arcane, [[Nature]] for primal, [[Occultism]] for occult, and [[Religion]] for divine). In cases where a ley line has multiple associated traditions, you can use any of the appropriate skills to Tap the Ley Line. The benefits of a ley line are always magical in nature and can be counteracted in a similar way to a magic item.

## Skill Uses

[[Arcana]] Tap Ley Line tapping an arcane ley line
[[Nature]] Tap Ley Line tapping a primal ley line
[[Occultism]] Tap Ley Line tapping an occult ley line
[[Religion]] Tap Ley Line tapping a divine ley line
