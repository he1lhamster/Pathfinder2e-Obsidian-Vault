You attempt to build a structure in the settlement that's granting the Civic activity. You may choose any structure for which you meet the requirements. Select the appropriate number of contiguous buildable lots in a single block as specified by the structure's entry and spend the specified RP and Commodity cost. Then attempt the structure's skill check.
 You can also use this activity to attempt to repair a structure that was damaged as the result of an event but hasn't been replaced by Rubble. To do this, first spend half the structure's listed RP and Commodity cost, and then attempt the specified check. The existing structure gives you a +2 item bonus to the check.
 On a success, record the new construction on the Urban Grid. Unless the structure's entry states otherwise, its effects are immediate; if the structure adjusts a Ruin's point total, adjust it upon construction.
**Critical Success** You construct or repair the structure with great efficiency and get back half of the Commodities spent in construction or repair.
**Success** You construct or repair the structure.
**Failure** You fail to construct or repair the structure. You can try to complete it next Kingdom turn; if you do so, you do not need to re-pay the RP and Commodity cost.
**Critical Failure** You fail to construct the structure; if you were attempting to repair a damaged structure, it is reduced to Rubble. In either event, Rubble now fills the structure's lots, which must be cleared with the Demolish activity before you can attempt to Build a Structure in them again.
