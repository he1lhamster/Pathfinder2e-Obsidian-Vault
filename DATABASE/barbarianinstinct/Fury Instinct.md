# Fury Instinct

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
Your rage comes from a deep and purely personal well within you. You use your rage as you choose.

## Anathema and Instinct Ability

You don't have an anathema or an instinct ability. Instead, you gain an additional 1st-level barbarian feat.

## Specialization Ability<span class="item-type">7th</span>

Increase the additional damage from [[DATABASE/action/Rage|Rage]] from 2 to 6. If you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase the additional damage from Rage to 12.

## Raging Resistance<span class="item-type">9th</span>

You resist physical weapon damage, but not physical damage from other sources (such as unarmed attacks).
