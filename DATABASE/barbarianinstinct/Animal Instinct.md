# Animal Instinct

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
The fury of a wild predator fills you when you [[Rage]], granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures that revere vicious animals (such as [[Ape]] or [[Bear]]) give rise to barbarians with this instinct. You might also be at war with an uncontrollable, animalistic side of your personality, or you might be a descendant of a [[Werewolf]] or another werecreature. Select an animal from Table 3–3: Animal Instincts that best matches your chosen animal.

## Table 3-3: Animal Instincts

## Anathema

Flagrantly disrespecting an animal of your chosen kind is anathema to your instinct, as is using weapons while raging.

## Bestial Rage (Instinct Ability)

When you [[Rage]], you gain your chosen animal's unarmed attack (or attacks). The specific attack gained, the damage it deals, and its traits are listed on Table 3–3: Animal Instincts. These attacks are in the [[Brawling]] group. Your [[Rage]] action gains the morph, primal, and transmutation traits.

## Specialization Ability<span class="item-type">7th</span>

Increase the damage die size for the unarmed attacks granted by your chosen animal by one step, and increase the additional damage from [[Rage]] from 2 to 5 for your chosen animal's unarmed attacks. The frog's tongue attack and deer's antler attack gain reach 10 feet. If you have greater weapon specialization, increase the damage from Rage from 5 to 12 for your chosen animal's unarmed attacks.

## Raging Resistance<span class="item-type">9th</span>

You resist piercing and slashing damage.
