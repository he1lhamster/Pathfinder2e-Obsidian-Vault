**Critical Blast** If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, roots entangle it. The target is [[Immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 [[Athletics]] check to pull itself free. The target doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid, or could otherwise escape without effort.
**Elemental Resistance** poison, wood
**Aura Junction** Life-giving blossoms spring up around you. Any ally that begins its turn in the aura gains 1 temporary Hit Point that lasts until the start of its next turn. This increases to 2 temporary Hit Points if you're 10th level or higher and to 3 temporary Hit Points if you're 15th level or higher.
**Skill Junction** [[Survival]], [[Terrain Expertise]]
