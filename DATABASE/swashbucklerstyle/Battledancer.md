To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing motions. You are trained in Performance and gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Fascinating Performance|Fascinating Performance]] skill feat. You gain panache during an encounter when the result of your [[DATABASE/skill/Performance|Performance]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Perform|Perform]] exceeds the Will DC of an observing foe, even if the foe isn't [[DATABASE/condition/Fascinated|fascinated]].
