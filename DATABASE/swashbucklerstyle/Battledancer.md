To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing motions. You are trained in Performance and gain the [[Fascinating Performance]] skill feat. You gain panache during an encounter when the result of your [[Performance]] check to [[Perform]] exceeds the Will DC of an observing foe, even if the foe isn't [[Fascinated]].
