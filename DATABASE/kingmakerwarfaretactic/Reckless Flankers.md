Your army is skilled at surrounding their foes and distracting them, at the cost of spreading out too much and being more vulnerable. When you use the Advance war action to successfully [[Engaged]] an army, you can choose to take a –2 circumstance penalty to your AC in order to gain a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls. If you do so, these modifiers remain in effect until you are no longer engaged. You can use the Outflank tactical war action.
