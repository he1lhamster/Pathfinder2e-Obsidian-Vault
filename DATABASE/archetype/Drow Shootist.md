# Drow Shootist

**Source** [[Pathfinder 165. Eyes of Empty Death]]
Some [[Drow]] take skill with the hand crossbow to new heights. You've learned the secrets of these fabled drow shootists. With fearlessness and swagger, you can accomplish amazing deeds with hand crossbows.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

**Prerequisites** trained in the [[Hand Crossbow]]

Every chance you get, you practice with the hand crossbow to increase your draw speed and accuracy. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the [[Hand Crossbow]]. If you're at least an expert in a hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You also gain the Shootist's Draw action.
 **Shootist's Draw** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You [[Interact]] to draw a hand crossbow and [[Strike]] with it, or you Strike with a loaded hand crossbow you're already holding and then Interact to stow it.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the drow shootist archetype.

## [[Repeating Hand Crossbow Training]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 165. Eyes of Empty Death]]
**Archetype** [[Drow Shootist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Drow Shootist Dedication]]

---
You become trained in the [[Repeating Hand Crossbow]] and gain access to repeating hand crossbows and [[Shootist Bandolier]]. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the repeating hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a repeating hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You can perform the [[Drow Shootist Dedication]] action with repeating hand crossbows.
**Special** If you have the [[Running Reload]] feat, you can reload a repeating hand crossbow magazine on the move. You can use Running Reload as a 3-action activity to reload a magazine into a repeating hand crossbow after you [[Stride]], [[Step]], or [[Sneak]], or as a 2-action activity if you use a magazine from a shootist bandolier.

## [[Reloading Trick]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Manipulate</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 165. Eyes of Empty Death]]
**Archetype** [[Drow Shootist]]
**Frequency** once per round
**Prerequisites** [[Drow Shootist Dedication]]
**Requirements** You're holding an unloaded hand crossbow.

---
You can fire off a single shot even when unprepared. You Interact to reload your [[Hand Crossbow]] and [[Strike]] with it.
**Special** If you have the [[Repeating Hand Crossbow Training]] feat, you can use this feat with a [[Repeating Hand Crossbow]] to load either a bolt or a magazine, but the speed means you can fire only one bolt, then the magazine jams. You must spend a 3-action Interact activity to remove the jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.

## [[Lethargy Poisoner]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 165. Eyes of Empty Death]]
**Archetype** [[Drow Shootist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Drow Shootist Dedication]]; trained in [[Crafting]]

---
You've learned more than the use of hand crossbows from drow lore. During your daily preparations, you can prepare a dose of [[Lethargy Poison]] from ordinary materials in a wilderness or urban area. If you're an expert in [[Crafting]], you can instead craft a dose of [[Stupor Poison]]. You can prepare two doses (of either poison) if you're a master in Crafting and three doses if you're legendary in Crafting. The save DC for this poison is equal to your class DC. Only you can use these poisons, and they expire the next time you make your daily preparations. The GM might decide that the area you're in is too barren to provide the materials you need for this feat.

---
You apply a poison to the required weapon; if you have a free hand, you can Interact to draw a poison as part of this action. If your next attack with that weapon before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, it applies the effects of the poison, provided that poison can be delivered by contact or injury. If you critically fail the attack roll, the poison is wasted as normal.
**Special** During your daily preparations, you can prepare a number of simple injury poisons equal to your rogue level. These poisons deal 1d4 poison damage. Only you can apply these poisons properly, and they expire the next time you prepare.
