# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

Every chance you get, you practice with the hand crossbow to increase your draw speed and accuracy. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the [[DATABASE/weapon/Hand Crossbow|hand crossbow]]. If you're at least an expert in a hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You also gain the Shootist's Draw action.
 **Shootist's Draw** <span class="action-icon">1</span> **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You [[DATABASE/action/Interact|Interact]] to draw a hand crossbow and [[DATABASE/action/Strike|Strike]] with it, or you Strike with a loaded hand crossbow you're already holding and then Interact to stow it.

You must spend a 3-action Interact activity to remove the jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.

You've learned more than the use of hand crossbows from drow lore. During your daily preparations, you can prepare a dose of [[DATABASE/equipment/Lethargy Poison|lethargy poison]] from ordinary materials in a wilderness or urban area. If you're an expert in [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]], you can instead craft a dose of [[DATABASE/equipment/Stupor Poison|stupor poison]]. You can prepare two doses (of either poison) if you're a master in Crafting and three doses if you're legendary in Crafting. The save DC for this poison is equal to your class DC. Only you can use these poisons, and they expire the next time you make your daily preparations. The GM might decide that the area you're in is too barren to provide the materials you need for this feat.

---
You apply a poison to the required weapon; if you have a free hand, you can Interact to draw a poison as part of this action. If your next attack with that weapon before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, it applies the effects of the poison, provided that poison can be delivered by contact or injury. If you critically fail the attack roll, the poison is wasted as normal.
**Special** During your daily preparations, you can prepare a number of simple injury poisons equal to your rogue level. These poisons deal 1d4 poison damage. Only you can apply these poisons properly, and they expire the next time you prepare.
