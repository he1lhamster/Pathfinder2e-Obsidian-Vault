# Ranger

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
You have studied hunting, tracking, and wilderness survival, adding a ranger’s tools to your skill set.

### Multiclass Ranger characters

The ranger archetype has access to excellent options to improve a character's monster knowledge and survival skills, but ranger is of particular interest to any character wanting to become a dedicated archer.

* Alchemist rangers can add snares to their daily free items, benefiting from a strong Crafting modifier, and their Intelligence makes them exceptional with monster knowledge feats. The ranger archetype is also useful to bombers who want to alternate with in bow attacks. 
* Champion rangers are particularly fitting for deities who connect thematically to nature or have a bow as their favored weapon. (Or, in the case of [[DATABASE/deity/Erastil|Erastil]], both!) 
* Fighter rangers are among the most fearsome archers, combining the best archery feats from both classes to create a fighting style unique to each fighter ranger. 
* Rogue rangers make excellent snipers or ranged skirmishers, and snares let them be on the other side of traps for a change. 
* Spellcaster rangers benefit greatly from ranger's feat support, backing up their spells with ranged weapon attacks. Druids have the most thematic overlap with rangers among the spellcasters, allowing you to create a true master of the wilderness.

You designate a single creature as your prey and focus your attacks against that creature. You must be able to see or hear the prey, or you must be tracking the prey during exploration.
 You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] your prey and a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] checks when you [[DATABASE/action/Track|Track]] your prey. You also ignore the penalty for making ranged attacks within your second range increment against the prey you’re hunting.
 You can have only one creature designated as your prey at a time. If you use Hunt Prey against a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new prey gains the designation. Your designation lasts until your next daily preparations.
