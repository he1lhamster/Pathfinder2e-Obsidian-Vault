# Wellspring Mage

**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
The source of your magic buckles against your control, always pressing to be released.

### Wellspring Magic (1st)

You regain magic power quickly, but it can be difficult for you to control. You must select Wellspring Mage Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.
 **Prerequisites**: You must have a class that casts spells with a spell repertoire.
 **Wellspring Mage Adjustments**: You learn spells as normal for your class, but change your spontaneous spellcasting in the following ways.
 You can cast fewer spells each day unless you gain more spells thanks to your wellspring. Reduce your number of spell slots of each spell level by 1. Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 1.
 A wellspring of magic fills you with power that's not fully under your control. When you roll initiative for a non-trivial combat encounter, as well as in other high-stress situations of the GM's choice, magic wells up within you. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. 
 **Critical Success** You temporarily recover an expended spell slot of any level of your choice. The temporary spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and if you don't use it by then, you experience an immediate wellspring surge. 
**Success** As critical success, except you randomly determine the level of spell slot from among your top three spell levels (or all your levels of spell slots if you have fewer than three). The slot lasts 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. 
**Failure** You generate a wellspring surge, with a spell level chosen randomly among your top three levels of spell slots (or all your levels if you have fewer than three). 
You can gain a temporary spell slot no more than twice per day. If you would gain a temporary spell slot for a level that has no expended spell slots, there's no effect. If you use a temporary slot to cast a spell with a duration, the spell ends whenever you would have lost the slot if its duration hasn't yet elapsed. If you roll for wellspring magic while you currently have a temporary spell slot, you automatically fail the flat check.

### Wellspring Surges

When your wellspring magic goes out of control, it becomes a wellspring surge. Typically, this happens when you fail the flat check from wellspring magic, but other wellspring mage feats have effects that sometimes cause you to generate a wellspring surge, or might even cause your foes to do so.
 Roll 1d20 and use Table 5–2: Wellspring Surges below to determine the surge's effect. If the effect calls for a damage type, the GM chooses the type based on the types of spells you know or your current location. The wellspring surge uses your spell DC. You have no control over the way your wellspring surge manifests. You are the point of origin for your wellspring surges, and you are not excluded from their effects. If you force a foe to generate a surge, they are the origin point of that surge instead.
 If your wellspring was granted by a being like a god or muse, the entity's intentions might sometimes alter the results of wellspring surges, or move the point of origin for an area to any point within 30 feet if the GM determines this fits the situation. For example, instead of uncontrolled damage, the entity might choose to damage only creatures opposing its plan, even if they are your allies.
 A wellspring surge always has the trait of your magical tradition, plus any traits that appear in parentheses at the end of the surge's effects.

|     1 | Energy Unleashed** (evocation) Raw energy deals 2d6 damage per spell level of the surge (basic Reflex save) in a 10-foot burst.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|     2 | Positive Energy Expulsion** (healing, necromancy, positive) Positive energy explodes outward, healing living creatures for 1d8 Hit Points per spell level of the surge in a 20-foot burst. Undead creatures instead take the same amount of positive damage, with a basic Will save.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|     3 | Mass Siphon** (transmutation) Creatures and objects within a 30-foot emanation become nearly weightless until the end of your next turn. Nearly weightless creatures can [[Climb]] at their land Speed and can [[Leap]] as far upward as they could normally Leap horizontally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|     4 | Magical Nemesis** (conjuration, teleportation) A random creature connected to your magic (or inimical to it) appears within 60 feet. The creature should be of a level approximately equal to the level of an animal summoned by [[Summon Animal]] of the spell level, although it can be of any type. The GM determines the specific creature. The creature is [[Unfriendly]] to you and [[Friendly]] to your apparent enemies. After 1 minute, the creature can choose either to return where it came from or to remain. It is not summoned or a minion. |
|     5 | Monstrous Transformation** (mental, morph, transmutation) Your head and arms transform into an exaggerated imitation of a creature connected to your magic for 1 minute. The GM determines the creature. You gain a status bonus to weapon and unarmed damage rolls equal to the spell level. At the start of each of your turns while you are transformed, you must succeed at a Will saving throw or be [[Confused]] until the start of your next turn. On a critical success, you can choose to end the effect entirely, also losing the status bonus.                                                             |
|     6 | Sudden Gale** (air, evocation) Weather in a 40-foot emanation is disturbed. Strong winds blow in a random direction for 1 minute. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or fall [[Prone]] (and be pushed 10 feet on a critical failure), and you must succeed at this save immediately after the surge. Any movement against the wind is difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain while flying.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|     7 | Tremor** (earth, evocation) The earth trembles in a 40-foot emanation. Each creature on a surface must immediately succeed at a Fortitude save or fall prone. The surface then becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|     8 | Oppressive Voice** (divination, mental, nonlethal) The voice of your muse, your deity, an ancestor, or another appropriate entity suddenly overwhelms your mind. You must attempt a Will saving throw. You take 1d4 mental damage per spell level with a basic Will save. On a failure, you're also [[Stunned]] (stunned 2 on a critical failure).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|     9 | Trinket Squall** (illusion) Visual illusions of objects related to your magic fall like rain throughout a 40-foot burst for 1 minute, giving concealment in the area. Creatures can attempt to disbelieve this illusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|    10 | Antimagic Eruption** (abjuration) The surge attempts to counteract a random spell active on you and on each creature within a 10-foot burst.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|    11 | Mental Broadcast** (detection, divination, mental) For 1 minute, everyone within 30 feet of you can hear your surface thoughts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|    12 | Verdant Clutch** (conjuration, plant) Plants and vines grow from all surfaces within 20 feet, causing all creatures in the area to be [[Immobilized]] unless they succeed at a Reflex save. The [[Escape]] DC is equal to the spell DC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|    13 | Tinge of Terror** (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) All creatures within 20 feet are affected by powerful fright. They attempt a Will save, becoming [[Frightened]] on a failure or frightened 2 on a critical failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|    14 | Strike up the Band** (auditory, illusion) For 1 minute, you are followed by orchestral theme music tied to the emotional content of the actions you're performing. This grants you a +2 status bonus to [[Diplomacy]], [[Intimidation]], and [[Performance]] checks, a –2 status penalty to [[Deception]] checks, and makes certain uses of [[Stealth]] virtually impossible. It might have other effects as the GM sees fit.                                                                                     |
|    15 | Life Sap** (necromancy) The surge drains your life force and strength. You become [[Drained]] and [[Doomed]], and you are [[Enfeebled]] for 1 minute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|    16 | Ablative Barrier** (abjuration) Energy forms a protective barrier that ablates slowly as creatures in the area take damage. All creatures in a 40-foot burst gain resistance to all damage equal to double the surge's spell level for up to 1 minute. Whenever a creature applies this resistance, the resistance for all affected creatures reduces by 1. The effect ends for all creatures when it reduces to 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|    17 | Luminous Pests** (illusion, visual) Numerous tiny flying creatures formed of bright colorful light, such as bats or hummingbirds, emerge from you, flying in a 30-foot cone. You and all creatures in the cone must succeed at a Will save or be [[Dazzled]] for 1 minute, or [[Blinded]] for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 minute on a critical failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|    18 | Emotional Turmoil** (emotion, enchantment, mental) A swirl of conflicting emotions overwhelm you from the surging magic. For 1 minute, attempt a DC 11 flat check at the start of each of your turns. On a success, you gain a +2 status bonus to all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks; on a failure, you take a –2 status penalty to them instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|    19 | Sudden Downpour** (evocation, water) Water cascades from above, putting out non-magical fires in a 10-foot burst and attempting to counteract magical fires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|    20 | Spell Surge** You immediately cast any spell in your repertoire of the surge's spell level or lower (or from your prepared spells or innate spells if you don't have a repertoire but have been forced to generate a wellspring surge). You must choose a spell that takes 3 or fewer actions to cast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

---
Defeat lets you to tap into your wellspring. Attempt the flat check for wellspring magic. If you critically succeed, you can choose to forgo gaining a temporary spell slot to instead have the triggering enemy undergo a wellspring surge. This surge functions just as it would for you, the only difference being that it emits from the enemy.

## [[Energetic Resonance]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Abjuration</span><span class="item-trait">Sorcerer</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]]

**Trigger** You would take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage from a spell.
**Requirements** You have an unexpended spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the triggering spell.
* This version of the Energetic Resonance feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Energetic Resonance]].

---
Your blood resonates with magical energy, mitigating the effects of harmful spells. Expend one of your spell slots of a level equal to or higher than that of the triggering spell. You gain resistance to one of the triggering effect's damage types equal to twice the expended spell slot's level.

## [[Spell Relay]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span><span class="item-trait">Sorcerer</span>

## [[Surging Might]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Manipulate</span><span class="item-trait">Metamagic</span><span class="item-trait">Oracle</span>

**Archetype** [[Wellspring Mage]]

---
With a complex gesture, you focus the divine power of your spell to overcome enemies' resistances. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount of the target's resistance equal to your level against all the following types of damage: chaotic, evil, good, lawful, negative, and positive. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including [[Persistent Damage]] and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the positive energy within a [[Field of Life]]. This doesn't cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances.

## [[Interfering Surge]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 12</span>

<span class="item-trait">Abjuration</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
**Archetype** [[Wellspring Mage]]
**Prerequisites** [[Wellspring Mage Dedication]]
**Trigger** A creature you can see Casts a Spell.
**Requirements** You have an unexpended spell slot and can see the triggering spell's manifestations.

---
You overcharge the triggering spell with magic. You expend a spell slot and attempt to counteract the triggering spell using the energy of the expended slot. If the triggering spell is in your repertoire and the spell slot you expended was a high enough level to cast it, you take no penalty. Otherwise, you take a –2 penalty to the counteract check if the triggering spell was cast using the same magical tradition you cast, or a –5 penalty if it was cast using a different tradition.
 If the triggering spell is successfully counteracted, it creates a wellspring surge from its caster in addition to the normal effects of being counteracted. If it isn't counteracted, your expended spell slot creates a wellspring surge from you.
**Special** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, primal, or occult).

## [[Scintillating Spell]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 16</span>

<span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span><span class="item-trait">Light</span><span class="item-trait">Metamagic</span><span class="item-trait">Sorcerer</span>

**Archetype** [[Wellspring Mage]]

---
Your spells become a radiant display of light and color. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that doesn't have the darkness trait, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a Reflex save, the spell explodes in a spray of scintillating lights, in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round, and those who critically failed are instead [[Blinded]] for 1 round.

## [[Echoing Spell]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 18</span>

<span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span><span class="item-trait">Metamagic</span><span class="item-trait">Sorcerer</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetypes** [[Time Mage]], [[Wellspring Mage]]

---
You time the components of your spell with exacting precision, setting up a resonance that duplicates the spell's effects. If your next action is to Cast a Spell of 4th level or lower that has no duration, the spell's energy reverberates and echoes. You can Cast the Spell a second time before the end of your next turn without expending a spell slot.
