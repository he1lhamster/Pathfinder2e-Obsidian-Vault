# Hellknight Signifer

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
Signifers are the powerful and enigmatic Hellknight spellcasters who support and sometimes lead other Hellknights on their missions to enforce unwavering law. Formidable in their own right, signifers are trained to be unstoppable forces of order and authority when they stand alongside their martial counterparts.

### Hellknight Archetypes

The following archetypes represent fully inducted members of a Hellknight order. You can select the dedication feats for these archetypes even if you haven’t yet gained three feats from the [[DATABASE/archetype/Hellknight Armiger|Hellknight armiger]] archetype. A character can’t have both the [[DATABASE/archetype/Hellknight|Hellknight]] and Hellknight signifer archetypes.

You have bolstered your force of will with the power of the Measure and the Chain. Upon initiation, you receive a signifer mask, often devoid of eyeholes or other decorative features. The mask doesn’t obscure your vision, though it makes it impossible for others to see your eyes. While wearing your signifer’s mask, you gain +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] checks to Lie, [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks, and Deception DCs against [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]]. You gain expert proficiency in Intimidation (or in another skill in which you’re trained of your choice, if you were already an expert in Intimidation) as well as in your choice of [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]], [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]], [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]].
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Hellknight signifer or [[DATABASE/archetype/Hellknight Armiger|Hellknight armiger]] archetypes.
