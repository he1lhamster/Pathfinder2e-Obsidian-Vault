# Stonebound

**Source** [[Pathfinder 195. Heavy is the Crown]]
A stonebound is a devoted sentinel who draws on the power of the earth and stone to protect their people.
 While stonebound are most commonly found in dwarven enclaves, the practice of binding oneself to the nature of stone is found in the mountains of Garund, Vudra, Arcadia, and in various Darklands communities. A person who binds themselves to stone becomes more resilient to damage, capable of surviving for longer than their unbound counterparts, and often gains a deeper understanding of stone beyond mere knowledge.
 Historians theorize that this technique originated in Orv and spread from there. The practice of binding to stone is most common where elemental power, especially the essence of earth, is the strongest. This practice has begun to spread to Belkzen, throughout the Darklands, and across the deserts of northern Garund. Most recently, the Martial Mineral Masters in Quain have adopted the technique for their new dojo and flour mill. The most famous stonebound public figure is Sorrina Westyr, Spellmaster for the Pathfinder Society, who spent a decade in the Elemental [[Plane of Earth]].

You bind yourself to the very essence of stone. You become trained in [[Plane of Earth]] [[Lore]] and learn the [[Terran]] language. If you are already trained in Plane of Earth Lore, you become trained in a skill of your choice. If you already speak Terran, you learn a common language of your choice. Increase your maximum Hit Points by your level.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the stonebound archetype.

Your blood becomes thick and sluggish, but no less effective at oxygenating your cells. You can selectively stop your bleeding with ease. Reduce the DC of flat checks to stop [[Persistent Damage]] from 15 to 10, and you can use a single action that has the concentrate trait to gain an early flat check without physically binding the wounds. You recover from the [[Drained]] condition twice as quickly as normal.

Your body becomes living stone. You don't need to eat or drink and need only 6 hours of rest to feel well rested. You must still rest at least 8 hours and spend 1 hour of preparation to regain resources usable only a limited number of times per day, such as spell slots. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases, poisons, and effects that would cause the [[Paralyzed]] or [[Stunned]] conditions. When you roll a successful saving throw against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead.
