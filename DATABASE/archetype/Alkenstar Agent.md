# Alkenstar Agent

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 178. Punks in a Powderkeg|Pathfinder #178: Punks in a Powderkeg]]
Outwardly dashing outlaws or silent, deadly bravos, these masters of combat and culture must hone a variety of skills to serve as secret agents and informants for the leader of Alkenstar, Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

Your unpredictable gunfire often catches enemies off guard or hits unprotected areas. Make a ranged Strike with a firearm against a creature that you haven't already attacked on this turn.

It becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Broken|broken]], and it deals its normal weapon damage to all creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the firearm, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC.

If the reaction has other requirements, such as wielding a specific kind of weapon, Snap Shot doesn’t allow you to ignore them; it allows you only to replace a melee weapon Strike with a ranged weapon Strike.
