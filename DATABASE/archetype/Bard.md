# Bard

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
A muse has called you to dabble in occult lore, allowing you to cast a few spells. The deeper you delve, the more powerful your performances become.

### Multiclass Bard characters

The bard archetype grants powerful effects that tend to use actions; it’s a great choice if you have actions to spare.

You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells. Your key spellcasting ability for bard archetype spells is Charisma, and they are occult bard spells. You become trained in [[Occultism]] and [[Performance]]; for each of these skills in which you were already trained, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
 Choose a muse as you would if you were a bard. You have that muse for all purposes, allowing you to take that muse's feats, but you don't gain any of the other abilities it grants.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bard archetype.
