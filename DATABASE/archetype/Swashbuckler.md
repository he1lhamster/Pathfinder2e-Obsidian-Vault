# Swashbuckler

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
The swashbuckler archetype is a great fit for martial characters who want to be a bit flashier or for Charisma-based spellcasters who want to add a bit of dramatic flair to their routine. Multiclass swashbucklers work especially well for characters who already wanted to perform the actions associated with gaining panache, such as a monk or barbarian with the gymnast style or a braggart, battledancer, or wit-style bard.
