# Soul Warden

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
You consider yourself an honorary [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomp]]—a shepherd of spirits who ensures the cycle of souls progresses unimpeded. Although you're unable to safeguard the cycle of souls in its entirety, you strive to ensure each soul's time on the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|Material Plane]] proceeds without incident. You work to free souls from imprisonment, prevent necromancers from animating the dead, and destroy undead so their souls rejoin the cycle.
 While most who hunt undead do so out of fear, vengeance, or a desire to protect the lives of others, you take a more measured and far less emotional approach; you destroy undead so their souls can continue their journey along the River of Souls, thus ensuring the continuation of existence. You understand that without the cycle of souls, the life cycle of the planes is disrupted, and all of existence could be consumed by the [[DATABASE/plane/Maelstrom|Maelstrom]].
 Nearly all soul wardens worship [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]] or one of the psychopomp ushers, especially [[DATABASE/deity/Barzahk|Barzahk]] the Passage, a psychopomp usher who routinely shirks their duties and needs help from mortal soul wardens. Soul wardens also often join organizations that regularly combat undead, including the Voices of the Spire and Ustalav's Ivory Reapers.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Soul Warden|Soul Warden]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]]; worships [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]] or a psychopomp usher

You can take 10 minutes to emblazon Pharasma's holy sigil—a spiraling comet that represents the winding path a soul takes through its existence—upon a shield, tabard, banner, or other prominent object that your wear or wield. The symbol doesn't fade until 1 year has passed, but if you emblazon the symbol again, any symbol you previously emblazoned and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly disappears. The item becomes a [[DATABASE/equipment/Religious Symbol|religious symbol]] of Pharasma and can be used as a divine focus while emblazoned.
 Whenever an undead creature or captive soul is within 100 feet of this object, the spiral glows, shedding dim blue light in a 10-foot radius. If the creature is hiding or the soul is hidden, it must succeed at a [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] check against your Perception DC to fool the sigil and prevent the spiral from glowing.
 In addition, you can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Disrupt Undead|disrupt undead]] as a divine innate cantrip at will. As normal, a cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity if you didn't have it already. You're trained in divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.
 When you have at least two other feats from this archetype, the spiral glows with bright light in a 10-foot radius (and dim light for the next 10 feet). Feats that require a creature or object to be in the light of your spiral function whether it's in the bright or dim light.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the soul warden archetype.

Your devotion to the cycle of souls grants you an additional divine spell. Choose from [[DATABASE/spell/Bless|bless]], [[DATABASE/spell/Disrupting Weapons|disrupting weapons]], or [[DATABASE/spell/Heal|heal]]. You must make this selection when you take this feat and it can't be changed. Once per day, while your spiral is glowing, you can cast the selected spell as a divine innate spell.

## [[DATABASE/feat/Domain Initiate|Domain Initiate]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Cleric</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Soul Warden|Soul Warden]]
* This version of the Domain Initiate feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[DATABASE/feat/Domain Initiate|original feat]].

---
Your deity bestows a special spell related to their powers. Select one domain—a subject of particular interest to you within your religion—from your deity's list. You gain an initial domain spell for that domain, a spell unique to the domain and not available to other clerics. Each domain's theme and domain spells can be found here.
 Domain spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.
 Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here.
**Special** You can select this feat multiple times, selecting a different domain each time and gaining its domain spell.

**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Soul Warden|Soul Warden]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Soul Warden Dedication|Soul Warden Dedication]]; familiar

---
Your familiar becomes a masked [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomp]]—an extraplanar guardian of the cycle of souls. This familiar continues to use all the same rules as other familiars, but one of its abilities must always be [[DATABASE/familiarability/Speech|speech]] and it has the monitor and psychopomp traits. As normal when a familiar must always have a certain ability, the speech ability counts against your familiar's abilities each day.
 You can select three familiar or master abilities each day, instead of two, but one must be one of the following psychopomp familiar abilities.

* **Soul Sight** Your familiar gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Lifesense|lifesense]] with a range of 30 feet.
* **Spirit Touch** Your familiar can touch incorporeal creatures. If you have the [[DATABASE/familiarability/Spell Delivery|spell delivery]] master ability from your familiar, any spell the familiar delivers with it gains the benefits of the [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]] property rune.

The light flows from your sigil of [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]] to shatter the bonds imprisoning a soul. You attempt to counteract a possession effect, or an effect, object, or spell that is imprisoning a soul (such as [[DATABASE/spell/Bind Soul|bind soul]], a _soul gem_, or a [[DATABASE/monster/Devourer|devourer's]] devoured souls). You must be within 60 feet of the possessed creature or object, or of the receptacle imprisoning the soul. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up, and your counteract modifier is your divine spell DC – 10. If the attempt fails, you can't use Liberate Soul against that particular effect again unless circumstances have changed drastically, as determined by the GM.

You trace a spiral in the air while intoning prayers to [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma]], gaining her blessing for a time. For 3 rounds, your Strikes and spells deal additional damage against undead, creatures in possession of an imprisoned soul, or creatures you have witnessed create or command undead. You gain a status bonus to damage with your Strikes against these creatures equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Spells you cast from spell slots gain a status bonus to damage against these creatures equal to the level of the spell; this bonus applies only to spells that deal damage and don't have a duration. If your spiral is glowing, you can target a willing creature in its light. If you do, that creature gains the bonuses instead of you.

Your psychopomp's continued service in [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasma's]] name brings it favor from the goddess. It might change appearance to look like a different, more powerful kind of psychopomp. You can select four familiar or master abilities each day, instead of two, but two must be from the Psychopomp Familiar feat or the following ability.

* **Augury** Your familiar can glimpse the strands of fate to give you a cryptic clue regarding your future. Your familiar can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Augury|augury]] once per day using your magical tradition and spell DC. You must be at least 8th level to select this ability.

**Special** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, you must select a different advanced domain spell from a domain for which you have an initial domain spell.
