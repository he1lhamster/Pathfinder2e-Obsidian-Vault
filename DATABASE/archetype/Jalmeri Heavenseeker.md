# Jalmeri Heavenseeker

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]], [[Pathfinder 158. Sixty Feet Under]]
Certain martial artists dedicate themselves to fighting in Jalmeray's Challenge of Sky and Heaven. These individuals devote themselves to the esoteric mysteries of the sky.
 You can select the dedication feat for the Jalmeri Heavenseeker archetype even if you haven't yet gained three feats from the [[Student of Perfection]] archetype.

**Archetype** [[Jalmeri Heavenseeker]]**Prerequisites** [[Student of Perfection Dedication]], or you've trained with a champion of the Challenge of Sky and Heaven

You become trained in either [[Acrobatics]] or [[Occultism]]; if you were already trained in both these skills, you become an expert in one of them instead. You gain either the [[Ki Rush]] or [[Ki Strike]] monk feat, which grants you a ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [[Refocus]] activity as a [[Monk]] does. If you already have both feats, you can instead choose a single 1st-level monk feat.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the Jalmeri Heavenseeker or [[Student of Perfection]] archetypes.

Until the end of your next turn, your unarmed attacks and any monk weapons you wield deal additional electricity and sonic damage; the amount of each damage type is equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon or unarmed attack. Any creature who successfully [[Grapple]] you or is successfully Grappled by you takes this damage immediately after the Grapple check is resolved (using the number of damage dice of your unarmed attack to determine the damage dealt).
 If you also know the [[Ki Blast]] ki spell, you can choose to deal either electricity or sonic damage with the spell instead of force while this effect is active (_ki blast_ loses the force trait and gains the electricity or sonic trait instead).

Your jagged blows are like lightning. The only Strikes you can make are skyward slash unarmed attacks. These unarmed attacks deal 1d10 slashing damage; are in the [[Brawling]] group; and have the nonlethal, unarmed, and versatile P traits. While in Sky and Heaven Stance, you gain resistance 2 to electricity and resistance 2 to sonic damage. These resistances increase to 5 at 12th level and to 8 at 18th level.

You [[Leap]] toward an opponent. At any point in the Leap, you can make a single Strike against a creature within your reach. At 12th level, if you hit with this Strike, instead of finishing your Leap, you can immediately attempt a second Leap from the space where you struck the target of your Strike. You can make a single Strike against a target within your reach during this second Leap as well. At 16th level, you can attempt a third Leap if your second Strike hits, and you can attack a target at any point during this third Leap. All Leaps made during this activity gain a +10-foot status bonus to the total height or distance of your leap, and no two Strikes can target the same creature.

You Stride up to your Speed, and your ki enshrouds your limbs in terrifying stormy energy, increasing the reach of your Sky and Heaven Stance unarmed attacks by 5 feet. At the end of your movement, make up to three Strikes against a target you can reach, each at a –2 penalty. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after you've made all your attacks. Instead of the usual slashing or piercing damage, the damage for these Strikes is either electricity or sonic, as you choose with each Strike. If you successfully hit with all three Strikes, the target is [[Drained]].
