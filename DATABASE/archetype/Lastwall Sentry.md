# Lastwall Sentry

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
While the nation of Lastwall is gone, leaving only the horror of the Gravelands behind, you refuse to give up and renounce your oaths. You’ve renewed your vows, swearing to combat the influence of the Whispering Tyrant wherever it might strike across Golarion.

---
You’ve sworn yourself as a sentry for the Knights of Lastwall, the first line of defense against incursions by the Whispering Tyrant throughout Golarion. You become trained in [[Athletics]] and in Undead [[Lore]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. Finally, you gain the [[Reactive Shield]] fighter feat.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Lastwall sentry archetype.

**Prerequisites** [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]

---
Extensive training against undead has taught you to cover your weak points, even when you think that you're alone. You aren't [[Flat-Footed]] to [[Hidden]], [[Undetected]], or flanking undead of your level or lower. However, the undead can still help their allies flank. If all of your opponents are undead, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls; the GM determines whether to apply this bonus if undead are disguised as another type of creature, if another type of creature is disguised as undead, or if there are additional opponents you haven't noticed who aren't undead.

Your uttered prayers become an aegis, drawing the blessing of your deity across the surface of your shield. Until the beginning of your next turn your shield, any [[Shield Boss]], or [[Shield Spikes]] gain the effects of a [[Ghost Touch]] property rune. Additionally, damage you take as a result of an incorporeal creature's Strike can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.

As stubborn in death as you are in life, you vow you'll never aid your hated enemies. You can't be transformed into an undead, except by effects that originate from an artifact or deity. Undead creatures that touch your corpse take 1 positive damage each time they do, or 1d6 positive damage each time they expose themselves to your corpse in a more thorough manner, such as by biting or carrying your corpse.

Any shield you wield gains the shove trait. When you [[Shove]] using a shield and Stride as part of that action, you can move an additional 5 feet to either side of the creature you Shoved. In addition, if you are in the [[Everstand Stance]] and successfully Shove a creature using a shield that you wield two-handed, you can increase the distance of your Shove to 10 feet.<span>Knights in Training</span>**Source** [[Legends]]
The following feats represent benefits of training from the Iomedars (Kalabrynne for knight vigilant, Clarethe for knight reclaimant, either for Lastwall sentry).

**Prerequisites** [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]

Your time spent hunting the undead allows you to sense them. You sense undead as a vague sense similar to a human’s sense of smell, an uncomfortable sensation akin to smelling something cloying and rotting. When in proximity to the undead, you eventually sense their presence, though you might not do so instantly, and you can’t pinpoint their location. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a [[Deception]] check against your Perception DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Grave Sense for 1 day.

**Archetype** [[Lastwall Sentry]]
**Prerequisites** [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]

---
You've battled more undead than you care to remember, often with little time to prepare between foes, forcing you to rely on experience and muscle memory to guide your blade. Attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] about an undead you can see and then Strike that undead. If your attempt to Recall Knowledge is successful, your Strike treats the target's resistances as 5 lower. The target is then immune to your Practiced Opposition for 24 hours.

## [[Flashing Shield]] <span class="action-icon">4</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>

**Archetype** [[Lastwall Sentry]]
**Prerequisites** [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]; you worship a good-aligned deity
**Trigger** You use the Shield Block reaction, and the opponent that triggered the Shield Block is undead and adjacent to you.

---
Your shield flares with holy light as you block the attack, searing the undead with the power of your faith. The triggering undead takes positive damage equal to half your level and becomes [[Flat-Footed]] for 1 round.

## [[Necromantic Bulwark]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
**Archetype** [[Lastwall Sentry]]
**Prerequisites** [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]

---
Regular exposure to necromantic effects left you better able to defend against them. When you have your shield raised, you gain your shield's circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that would deal negative damage. If you have the Shield Block reaction, negative damage you take can trigger the reaction, even though the damage isn't physical damage.

## [[Necromantic Tenacity]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Lastwall Sentry]]
**Prerequisites** [[Necromantic Resistance]]

---
Your training against necromantic effects allows you to escape the worst of their touch. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a necromancy effect, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure on such a save, you get a failure instead.

## [[Grave Sight]] <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

**Archetype** [[Lastwall Sentry]]
**Prerequisites** [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]; [[Grave Sense]]

---
Your ability to sense undead has improved. You sense undead as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet: an uncomfortable sensation brushes against your spirit and stinks of rot. When in proximity to an undead, you can sense its presence, but it has the [[Hidden]] condition instead of the [[Observed]] condition. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a [[Deception]] or [[Stealth]] check against your Perception DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds, it's [[Undetected]], and you have to use the [[Seek]] basic action to detect the creature. As with hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to Seek to locate an undetected creature.

**Archetype** [[Lastwall Sentry]]
**Prerequisites** [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]

---
You use your shield to protect your allies, not just yourself, especially against the undead. When you have a shield raised, you can use your [[Shield Block]] reaction when an attack is made against an ally adjacent to you, in addition to its usual trigger. If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of you, following the normal rules for a [[Shield Block]].
If an undead makes an attack against an ally within 10 feet, you can Step to become adjacent to your ally and then use [[Shield Block]] as part of the same reaction.

Your regular exposure to the insidious putrescence of undeath inured you to its effects. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws made against spells and effects with the death, disease, and evil traits. Whenever you become [[Drained]] or [[Sickened]], reduce the status penalty you take from the condition by 1, to a minimum of 0.

You hold your shield together with the power of your faith and conviction, refusing to let wood splinter and steel shatter until the day's battles are won. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your Shield Block, the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened until you repair it, preventing you from using Resolute Defender to save the same shield again until your next daily preparations.
