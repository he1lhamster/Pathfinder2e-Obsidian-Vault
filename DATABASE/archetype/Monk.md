# Monk

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
Monastic training has taught you martial arts and allowed you to hone your mind, body, and spirit to new heights.

### Multiclass Monk characters

The monk archetype is a strong choice for any character that fights unarmored or with unarmed attacks.

* Barbarian monks with the animal instinct can combine the barbarian’s excellent unarmed damage with the monk’s diverse unarmed special abilities. 
* Champion monks are perfect for champions of Irori or other deities who favor unarmed attacks. 
* Fighter monks can supplement free-fighting and add mobility to the fighter’s toolkit. 
* Rogue monks are incredibly effective because stances grant some of the best agile finesse attacks and flurry gives more sneak attacks. 
* Spellcaster monks can fight with a free hand and still use material components to cast spells.
