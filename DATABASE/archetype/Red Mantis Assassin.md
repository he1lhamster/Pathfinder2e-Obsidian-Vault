You have learned limited divine magic from your Red Mantis training. You gain the [[DATABASE/action/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] activity. You’re a prepared spellcaster, able to prepare two cantrips and one 1st-level spell each day. You prepare these spells from a Red Mantis assassin spellbook, similar to a wizard’s, containing three cantrips and two 1st-level spells. All the spells in your Red Mantis assassin spellbook, from this and later feats, must be either transmutation or illusion spells from the arcane spell list or a spell from the following list: [[DATABASE/spell/Clairaudience|clairaudience]], [[DATABASE/spell/Clairvoyance|clairvoyance]], [[DATABASE/spell/Darkness|darkness]], [[DATABASE/spell/Dimension Door|dimension door]], [[DATABASE/spell/Modify Memory|modify memory]], [[DATABASE/spell/Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]], [[DATABASE/spell/Paralyze|paralyze]], [[DATABASE/spell/See Invisibility|see invisibility]], [[DATABASE/spell/True Strike|true strike]]. Regardless of their usual magical tradition, your Red Mantis assassin spells are divine spells, as are any Red Mantis focus spells you gain.
 You can prepare two cantrips and one 1st-level spell each day from those found in your Red Mantis assassin spellbook. You’re trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for casting divine spells. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.

You swathe yourself in a veil of red mist for 1 minute. While the shroud is active, you gain fast healing equal to half your level. You can Interact with your shroud, swirling it around you, to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn. Finally, if you die while the shroud is active, you can choose to have your entire body vanish into red mist, leaving behind only your gear; you make this choice when you activate Crimson Shroud.

You also gain the [[DATABASE/spell/Achaekek's Clutch|Achaekek's clutch]] focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] by praying to [[DATABASE/deity/Achaekek|Achaekek]] or researching your assigned kill.

The Red Mantis Assassin archetype appears on page 71 of the _Lost Omens World Guide_. Of the additional options below, only Prayer Attack is available freely to Red Mantis assassins without prior permission from the Blood Mistress. Those who dare learn these rare abilities without her permission run the risk of being cast out of the society and hunted down by their former allies. In theory, a daring infiltration of the Crimson Citadel could allow one to study hidden texts and learn these techniques, but the chambers within and below this fortress are among the most dangerous in the region, so such an attempt should not be made lightly!

You've mastered the signature assassination style of the Red Mantis. Attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Feint|Feint]] an enemy within 30 feet. If your Feint is successful, when you use Prayer Attack on subsequent turns you automatically make the target [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against your melee attacks for that turn without rolling a check to Feint, so as long as you remain visible to the target and the target remains within 30 feet of you. If you use your Prayer Attack against a different target, you must attempt to Feint the target normally.
 When you use Prayer Attack, your next successful Strike with a sawtooth saber that turn deals 2d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] to the target.<span>Secrets of the Vernai</span>**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Legends|Legends]]
