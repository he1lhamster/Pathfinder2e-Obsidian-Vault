# Unexpected Sharpshooter

## Skilled or Lucky

Part of the fun of roleplaying an unexpected sharpshooter is the ambiguity and mystery of how your character achieves their surprising success. Your character at first seems like they bumble into their successes through sheer circumstance. However, when the circumstances pile up, others might start to suspect another possibility: perhaps your character is secretly so incredible that they not only achieve impressive results but do so in a way that hides their skill behind a veneer of lucky breaks. Ultimately, either could be true about your character, or some combination of both. You might decide the truth together with the GM as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until later to make that call. Because this archetype hints at hidden talent intentionally obfuscated, it offers a good choice for a character who's secretly more powerful or skilled than they seem or who must hide their abilities for some reason—perhaps associated with the plot of the campaign.
 If your inclination is to play a character who hides their abilities, consider training in the [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] skill and taking skill feats like [[DATABASE/feat/Charming Liar|Charming Liar]] and [[DATABASE/feat/Confabulator|Confabulator]] that emphasize your character's crafty nature and skill at concealing their true intent.
 If you instead prefer to play a character who's legitimately a bit uncoordinated but abnormally lucky, you might choose to pursue actions that have a high chance of earning you a Hero Point. You could also consider taking abilities with the fortune or misfortune traits, such as [[DATABASE/feat/Halfling Luck|Halfling Luck]] or [[DATABASE/feat/Harbinger's Caw|Harbinger's Caw]].

Some people say you must be the luckiest soul in all of Golarion to still be alive and kicking after all the dangers you've seen. Others say that, given the circumstances and the number of foes who you've defeated seemingly by accident, that there's no way you can really be as incompetent as you seem. These critics claim there has to be some kind of angle, some racket you're running. Either way, you sure don't look or act dangerous, except possibly to yourself.
 Somehow, despite your apparent clumsiness, professed confusion, and known propensity to incite calamity, you find yourself standing after every battle. The same can't often be said for your enemies. Funny how that works out, isn't it?

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

Who needs skill when you've got dumb luck? Sometimes your shots hit miraculously, regardless of the fact that you seemed to slip when you pulled the trigger or that you weren't aiming at your foe when you fired. You gain the Accidental Shot activity.
 **Accidental Shot** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (fortune) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You make a Strike with a ranged weapon, rolling the attack and damage twice and using the better results for each. The attack ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the target being concealed or hidden.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the unexpected sharpshooter archetype.

* This version of the Hit the Dirt! feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[DATABASE/feat/Hit the Dirt!|original feat]].

---
You fling yourself out of harm's way. You [[DATABASE/action/Leap|Leap]]. Your movement gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. Regardless of whether or not the triggering attack hits, you land [[DATABASE/condition/Prone|prone]] after completing your Leap.

**Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack, even if you aren't aware of it.

---
Your enemy lies in wait, lines up the perfect shot, and pulls the trigger... then at just the right moment you duck down to notice something scrawled on the cobblestone in chalk, a shiny coin, or some other coincidental distraction, creating an opportunity for the attack to miss. The attacker must roll the attack twice and use the worse result.

---
You've practiced a technique for rapidly reloading your firearm, but attempting to use this technique is a dangerous gamble with your firearm's functionality. Interact to reload a firearm, then make a Strike with that firearm. If the Strike fails, the firearm misfires.

Despite the devastation your weapons tend to inflict upon their targets or the destruction you might unleash upon an area, your foes still manage to walk away at the end of a fight—at least sometimes. You can choose to add the nonlethal trait to your ranged weapons, making the choice of whether to add the trait or not just before each Strike.

**Frequency** once per round
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication|Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication]]; master in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]]
**Requirements** Either you used Accidental Shot and hit your opponent with the Strike this turn, or you used Lucky Escape since your last turn and the triggering attack missed you.

---
You laugh innocently about the inexplicable luck of your last shot hitting its mark or how close the attack that just missed you came to taking your head off, causing your foes to second guess whether it's a good idea to oppose you in battle. Attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] either the foe you hit with [[DATABASE/feat/Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication|Accidental Shot]] or the foe that missed you due to [[DATABASE/feat/Lucky Escape|Lucky Escape]]. You use [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] instead of Intimidation to attempt the check to Demoralize.

While no one, not even you, might appear to understand why, you demonstrate a greater ability to hit your targets regardless of the obstacles in your way. You can use the [[DATABASE/feat/Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication|Accidental Shot]] activity granted to you by the Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication once per hour instead of once per day.

## [[DATABASE/feat/I Meant to Do That|I Meant to Do That]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

**Frequency** once per hour
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication|Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication]]; trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]]
**Requirements** Your previous action was a ranged weapon Strike that missed a foe within 60 feet.

---
Somehow your stray bullet causes an unintended reaction that creates a problem for your enemy: perhaps a ricochet knocks your foe's weapon away or they stumble over stray debris in an attempt to dodge your bullets. Roll a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check to attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]], [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]], or [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] the foe you missed.

**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded crossbow or firearm.

---
You shoot not at your foe but at an object nearby. Make a Strike with your firearm against an AC equal to an easy DC for your level. On a success, instead of hitting your foe, your attack hits an object behind or to the side of your target, creating one of the following effects. The GM might determine that a different AC is appropriate or that a particular effect isn't a valid option, such as using the explosive barrel option when there's no such object on the battlefield. The GM should inform you if a Trick Shot is feasible before you spend your actions, since your trained eye can easily recognize loose or volatile objects.

* **Dislodge Object** Your attack knocks an unattended object of no more than 2 Bulk out of position, moving it up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. For example, the weapon could knock a wizard's crystal ball off a table.
* **Explosive Barrel** Your attack strikes a barrel of expensive rum, a vial of volatile alchemical fluids, a demonic pustule erupting from the earth, or some other explosive object. The object explodes in a 20-foot burst, and creatures in the area take 6d6 damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The damage type is chosen by the GM, based on the exploding object. Increase the damage by 1d6 for every 2 levels you have above 10th.

You fire your gun once, creating a devastating and unpredictable chain of events; perhaps your bullet strikes exactly the right spot on a water tower, causing it to flood and incite a stampede of horses which knock over a lantern that sets a city on fire. Whatever the exact chain reaction, and no matter how improbable, the indiscriminate catastrophe creates significant challenges for your enemies across a wide area while leaving everyone else alone.
 Make a Strike with a ranged weapon, and if you hit, you can make another Strike at a target within 30 feet of the first target. If you hit the second target, attempt to Strike a third target within 30 feet of the second target, and so on, continuing until you miss a target. You can cease the chain at any point; otherwise, it ends when you first miss an attack. However, you can't target the same creature more than once; each time you move to a new target, it must be a target you haven't made a Strike against yet during this particular use of Chain Reaction.
 This damage is caused by some improbable set of events that injures one target after another, rather than from actually making several shots. Perhaps you shot at a tree branch that then fell on the targets, or one target's scream caused another to accidentally set off their gun and shoot themselves in the foot. This means that only the first target suffers any special effects tied to the bullet (if it was magical ammunition, for example), but each target you hit still takes the same damage dealt by your Strike. Normally, all damage is of the same damage type as the initial bullet. However, the GM might choose to change the damage type based on their description of the chain reaction. For example, if one target was burned by fire, that target might take fire damage instead of physical damage.
