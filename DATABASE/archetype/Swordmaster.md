# Swordmaster

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
Though the ultimate goal of the Pathfinder society is to learn, knowledge cannot be spread if those who discover it fail to come back alive. The Master of Swords teaches recruits to survive, to defend other Pathfinders, and to defeat the Society’s enemies. The swordmaster embodies these skills, focusing on practicality and ignoring ideals or methods that interfere with their ability to overcome any challenge.

### Pathfinder Society Archetypes

The following archetypes are uncommon, but are available to members of the Pathfinder Society. Qualifying characters with the [[DATABASE/archetype/Pathfinder Agent|Pathfinder agent archetype]] can select one of these dedication feats even if they have not gained three feats from the Pathfinder agent archetype, and each of these archetypes’ feats fulfills the [[DATABASE/feat/Pathfinder Agent Dedication|Pathfinder Agent Dedication’s]] special requirement despite not being from the Pathfinder agent archetype.

Your Swords training taught you to never lose hold of your weapon. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when foes attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] you. If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Deft Cooperation|Deft Cooperation]] feat and critically succeed on a check to [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] an ally’s attack roll or skill check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus from Deft Cooperation (instead of a +1 bonus) the first time you attempt an attack roll or attempt a skill check where the bonus would apply.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Swordmaster archetype.
