# Bastion

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some say that a good offense is the best defense, but you find such boasting smacks of overconfidence. In your experience, the best defense is a good, solid shield between you and your enemies. You've focused your training on how best to use a shield to protect yourself and those around you.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

---
You change your grip on the shield, allowing you to combine rapid attacks with your shield boss or shield spikes and your main weapon's Strikes in a series of swift motions. You reduce your shield boss and shield spikes weapon damage die to 1d4. As long as the weapon damage die is 1d4, your shield boss and shield spike Strikes gain the agile weapon trait. You can use Agile Shield Grip again to switch to a normal grip, returning the damage to the usual amount and removing the agile trait.

You brace your shield with both hands, enhancing its potential for both offense and defense. When in this stance, you wield the shield with both hands. When wielding a shield this way, increase the weapon damage die of the shield’s boss or spikes by one step, and increase the shield’s Hardness by 2 when using the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction.<span>Knights of Lastwall Class Feats</span>**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
The following class feats are available to Knights of Lastwall. Those with the champion trait are champion class feats. Those with both the champion and fighter traits are both champion class feats and fighter class feats; when you take one of these feats, it loses the trait that doesn’t apply to your class.

You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even while using the hand that's holding it for other purposes. The hand you use to wield a shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the Interact action. You can also hold another object in this hand (but you still can't use it to wield a weapon). This benefit doesn't apply to [[DATABASE/shield/Tower Shield|tower shields]], which are still too cumbersome.

---
When your shield is up, your enemies' blows can't touch you. When you have your shield raised, you can Stride to move half your Speed without triggering reactions that are triggered by your movement (such as [[DATABASE/action/Attack of Opportunity|Attacks of Opportunity]]). You can use Shielded Stride while [[DATABASE/action/Fly|Flying]] or [[DATABASE/action/Swim|Swimming]] instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.

**Trigger** An enemy within your reach Strikes an ally adjacent to you.
**Requirements** You have your shield raised.

---
You push the enemy back and attempt to intercede between the foe and your ally. You attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] the triggering enemy with your shield just as it attacks, pushing it back just after the attempt. Your shield has the shove trait for this Shove attempt. If the shove succeeds, you throw off your enemy's timing, and the enemy takes a –1 circumstance penalty on its attack roll against your ally.

You can use your shield to fend off the worst of area effects and other damage. When you [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raise your Shield]], you gain your shield's circumstance bonus to Reflex saves. If you have the [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction, damage you take as a result of a Reflex save can trigger that reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.

---
You use your shield to protect your allies. When you have a shield raised, you can use your [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction when an attack is made against an ally adjacent to you. If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of preventing you from taking damage, following the normal rules for Shield Block.

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Bastion Dedication|Bastion Dedication]]

---
You can protect yourself more effectively, at the expense of your shield. When you [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]], you can reduce the damage to yourself by double the shield's Hardness, but if you do, the shield takes double the normal amount of damage it would have taken (before applying its Hardness). You can't use Destructive Block if your shield can't be broken or destroyed, such as if you're using an [[DATABASE/equipment/Indestructible Shield|indestructible shield]].

---
You can bring your shield into place with hardly a thought. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to Shield Block.

**Requirements** You have a shield raised.
* This version of the Mirror Shield feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[DATABASE/feat/Mirror Shield|original feat]].

---
You reflect the spell back against the triggering opponent. Make a ranged attack against the triggering creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. If you can cast spells, you can make a spell attack roll instead. If you succeed, your opponent takes the effects of a successful spell attack roll for their own spell (or the effects of a critical success if your attack roll was a critical success).

**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Bastion|Bastion]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Bastion Dedication|Bastion Dedication]]

---
You can save your shield from total destruction, even after a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your [[DATABASE/feat/Shield Block|Shield Block]], the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened until you take the time to repair it, preventing you from using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next preparations.
