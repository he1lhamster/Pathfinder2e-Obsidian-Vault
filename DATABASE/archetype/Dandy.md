# Dandy

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You are a genteel master of style, culture, and decorum, aware of even the subtlest rules of etiquette. Whether you were born into status, acquired it later in life, or merely pretend to possess it, you look and act your part to manicured perfection.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

You are a consummate student of dignity, etiquette, and fashion. You can use the [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill to perform the special downtime activity Influence Rumor, spending at least one day of downtime to manipulate the course, tone, or content of a rumor to your benefit. The difficulty of Influencing a Rumor is determined by the GM based on the size of the community, the relative perceptiveness of the inhabitants, and the agency of other rumormongers, but it typically starts with at least DC 15 for a small village and increases to at least DC 20 for a town, at least DC 30 for a city, and at least DC 40 for a metropolis.
 You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.
**Special** You can't select another Dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the dandy archetype.

You know how to maintain a good impression and manage your image, even while keeping uncouth company. Make a [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check against the target's Will DC. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Distracting Flattery for 10 minutes.
**Success** The target's attitude doesn't decrease as a result of your ally's social blunder.
**Failure** The target's attitude decreases, as normal.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt makes matters worse, decreasing the target's attitude toward you by one step, in addition to any changes from the behavior that triggered this reaction.

Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed on every topic. You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Gossip Lore]], a special Lore skill that can be used only to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Gossip Lore, you get the effects of the [[DATABASE/feat/Dubious Knowledge|Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
 If you have legendary proficiency in [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]], you gain expert proficiency in Gossip Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Gossip Lore by any other means.

The Sapphire Butterfly is not one for violence when simply intimidating a foe will do. From that vigilante's techniques, you've learned how to pull a deadly blow at the last moment, threatening your target instead of striking them. Rather than dealing damage with the triggering Strike, attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] check with a +2 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet who can see you. If you critically succeed at your check to Demoralize the target of your Strike, their attitude toward you improves by one step while they also become [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 2]].

Repeated entries in Firebrand bragging and flyting contests have taught you how to twist pretty words into concealed insults. When you succeed at your check to [[DATABASE/action/Coerce|Coerce]] a creature, the target's attitude toward you improves by one step, to a maximum of [[DATABASE/condition/Friendly|friendly]], and they don't become [[DATABASE/condition/Unfriendly|unfriendly]] 1 day later.

You attend all the fashionable society parties, no matter how exclusive they might be. Any time you encounter a social event you would ordinarily be denied access to, such as a coronation, royal gala, or other society function, you can spend 1d4 hours to secure entry without the need for a skill check. You find invitations, invitees looking for fashionable dates, temporary jobs with the caterers, event staff willing to look the other way, or some other mode of access for yourself and your allies. This ability doesn't apply to secret events or other small private gatherings with no staff, dates, or outsiders involved.

You have an eye for fashion and know how to sell attitude and confidence with your walk. You Stride up to your Speed. All enemies within 30 feet of your movement are enraptured by your performance: they must succeed at a Will saving throw or become unable to use reactions until the end of your next turn. The DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
