# Dandy

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You are a genteel master of style, culture, and decorum, aware of even the subtlest rules of etiquette. Whether you were born into status, acquired it later in life, or merely pretend to possess it, you look and act your part to manicured perfection.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Dandy Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Dandy]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Diplomacy]]

---
You are a consummate student of dignity, etiquette, and fashion. You can use the [[Diplomacy]] skill to perform the special downtime activity Influence Rumor, spending at least one day of downtime to manipulate the course, tone, or content of a rumor to your benefit. The difficulty of Influencing a Rumor is determined by the GM based on the size of the community, the relative perceptiveness of the inhabitants, and the agency of other rumormongers, but it typically starts with at least DC 15 for a small village and increases to at least DC 20 for a town, at least DC 30 for a city, and at least DC 40 for a metropolis.
 You become trained in [[Deception]] and [[Society]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.
**Special** You can't select another Dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the dandy archetype.

## [[Distracting Flattery]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Dandy]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dandy Dedication]]; expert in [[Deception]]
**Trigger** You observe a target's attitude toward yourself or your allies decrease as a result of an ally's behavior.

---
You know how to maintain a good impression and manage your image, even while keeping uncouth company. Make a [[Deception]] check against the target's Will DC. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Distracting Flattery for 10 minutes.
**Success** The target's attitude doesn't decrease as a result of your ally's social blunder.
**Failure** The target's attitude decreases, as normal.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt makes matters worse, decreasing the target's attitude toward you by one step, in addition to any changes from the behavior that triggered this reaction.

## [[Gossip Lore]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Dandy]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dandy Dedication]]

---
Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed on every topic. You are trained in [[Lore]], a special Lore skill that can be used only to [[Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Gossip Lore, you get the effects of the [[Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
 If you have legendary proficiency in [[Society]], you gain expert proficiency in Gossip Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Gossip Lore by any other means.

## [[Tut-Tut]] <span class="action-icon">4</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Emotion</span><span class="item-trait">Fear</span><span class="item-trait">Mental</span><span class="item-trait">Press</span>

**Archetypes** [[Dandy]], [[Duelist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Duelist Dedication]], or [[Dandy Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You hit a creature with a melee attack roll.

---
The Sapphire Butterfly is not one for violence when simply intimidating a foe will do. From that vigilante's techniques, you've learned how to pull a deadly blow at the last moment, threatening your target instead of striking them. Rather than dealing damage with the triggering Strike, attempt an [[Intimidation]] check with a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet who can see you. If you critically succeed at your check to Demoralize the target of your Strike, their attitude toward you improves by one step while they also become [[Frightened]].

## [[Cutting Flattery]] <span class="item-type">Feat 5</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>

**Archetypes** [[Dandy]], [[Pirate]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dandy Dedication]], or [[Pirate Dedication]]; trained in [[Intimidation]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.

---
Repeated entries in Firebrand bragging and flyting contests have taught you how to twist pretty words into concealed insults. When you succeed at your check to [[Coerce]] a creature, the target's attitude toward you improves by one step, to a maximum of [[Friendly]], and they don't become [[Unfriendly]] 1 day later.

## [[Feeling Your Oats]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Mental</span><span class="item-trait">Open</span>

**Frequency** once per hour
**Prerequisites** [[Celebrity Dedication]], or [[Dandy Dedication]]; trained in [[Deception]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.

---
You are incredible, impeccable, an icon of style and grace—and everyone knows it. In this moment, you are living your fantasy, and no one can shake you out of it. Roll a [[Deception]] check. You can substitute the result of your Deception check for one Will save you would be required to attempt in the next minute.

## [[Fabricated Connections]] <span class="item-type">Feat 7</span>

**Archetype** [[Dandy]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dandy Dedication]]; master in [[Deception]]

---
You can lie about having taken an action so convincingly that you acquire all the tangible benefits of having successfully completed it. You can roll [[Deception]] in place of a different skill when attempting to [[Earn Income]], [[Make an Impression]], [[Request]], or [[Subsist]]. You can use Fabricated Connections to Make an Impression or Request once per day, and you can also use it once per week to Earn Income or Subsist.

## [[Party Crasher]] <span class="item-type">Feat 7</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Dandy]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dandy Dedication]]; master in [[Society]]

---
You attend all the fashionable society parties, no matter how exclusive they might be. Any time you encounter a social event you would ordinarily be denied access to, such as a coronation, royal gala, or other society function, you can spend 1d4 hours to secure entry without the need for a skill check. You find invitations, invitees looking for fashionable dates, temporary jobs with the caterers, event staff willing to look the other way, or some other mode of access for yourself and your allies. This ability doesn't apply to secret events or other small private gatherings with no staff, dates, or outsiders involved.

## [[Statement Strut]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Mental</span><span class="item-trait">Visual</span>

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes
**Prerequisites** [[Celebrity Dedication]], or [[Dandy Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.

---
You have an eye for fashion and know how to sell attitude and confidence with your walk. You Stride up to your Speed. All enemies within 30 feet of your movement are enraptured by your performance: they must succeed at a Will saving throw or become unable to use reactions until the end of your next turn. The DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
