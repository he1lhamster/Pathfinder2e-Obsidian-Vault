# Ursine Avenger Hood

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Treasure Vault|Treasure Vault]] 
Some items inherit their magic not through an intentional spell or ritual but through generations of use and belief, slowly accumulating power and intent from those around them. The [[DATABASE/equipment/Ursine Avenger Hood|Ursine Avenger Hood]] is such an item. After defeating a powerful [[DATABASE/monster/Cave Bear|cave bear]], the Ulfen hunter Baruk shaped the bear's head and fur into a helm and cape for himself. Baruk later fell in battle against a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Linnorm|linnorm]], successfully slaying the beast before succumbing to its death curse. His helm, soaked in the blood of man and linnorm and saturated with the magic of the linnorm's curse, was claimed by Baruk's daughter, who often told stories about the helm giving her a bear's strength and ferocity, though it was unclear at the time whether this was a boast.
 Over many generations, the magic of the hood was proven true, and more than that, the magic continued to grow and evolve with ever-more-ursine attributes. As the belief and power of each new wearer soaked into the hood, the artifact's potential has continued to grow. Now, those who bond with the generational artifact will discover that the _Ursine Avenger Hood_ continues to grow in power alongside them.

You draw the _[[DATABASE/equipment/Ursine Avenger Hood|Ursine Avenger Hood]]_ over your head and its fur over your arms, assuming an ursine form that has traits of your original form as well as that of a bear. In your ursine form, you gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage and a claws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage and has the agile trait. Both unarmed attacks are in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] group. You lose the ability to speak complex sentences while transformed and can only communicate through grunts and gestures; this prevents you from using effects that require a shared or spoken language until you revert back to your non-hybrid form. You can use this action while transformed to remove the hood and return to your original form.
