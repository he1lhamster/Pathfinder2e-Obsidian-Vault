# Inventor

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
You revel in the creation of clever inventions, deploying your brilliance to defeat your foes. Explosives, gadgets, and innovative technologies? You have ideas for all of them, and you're eager to test your theories.

### Multiclass Inventor Characters

Inventor is a great fit for intelligent characters looking to branch out and learn new tricks, especially [[DATABASE/class_/Alchemist|alchemists]], who are already good at [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] and may appreciate unstable options as an alternative to daily alchemical resources. If they meet the Intelligence requirements, [[DATABASE/class_/Cleric|clerics]] of deities who encourage invention and experimentation like [[DATABASE/deity/Brigh|Brigh]] are an amazing fit, both because it makes narrative sense and because such characters can usually [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] while fixing their innovation after using an unstable ability.
