# Acrobat

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You have trained your body to perform incredible, seemingly superhuman feats of grace. You move in ways that leave your opponents caught off guard and fumbling for a response, turning every fight into performance art.

## [[Acrobat Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Acrobat]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Acrobatics]]

---
You become an expert in [[Acrobatics]]. At 7th level, you become a master in Acrobatics, and at 15th level, you become legendary in Acrobatics. Whenever you critically succeed at an Acrobatics check to [[Tumble Through]] an enemy's space, you don't treat the enemy's space as difficult terrain.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the acrobat archetype.

## [[Contortionist]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Acrobat]]
**Prerequisites** [[Acrobat Dedication]]

---
You can squeeze out of tight situations surprisingly quickly, gaining an advantage against foes that try to pin you down. You gain the [[Quick Squeeze]] skill feat, and if you're a master in [[Acrobatics]], you can Squeeze at full Speed. Whenever you successfully [[Escape]] using Acrobatics, the creature you Escaped from is [[Flat-Footed]] against the next attack you make against it before the end of your next turn.

## [[Dodge Away]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Acrobat]]
**Prerequisites** [[Acrobat Dedication]]
**Trigger** You are the target of a melee attack.
**Requirements** You're aware of the attack and aren't [[Flat-Footed]].

---
You use your acrobatic prowess to evade an attack, using momentum to keep yourself moving, if you choose. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses you, you can Step after the Strike. If you're a master in [[Acrobatics]], you can move 10 feet on this Step instead of 5 feet.

## [[Graceful Leaper]] <span class="item-type">Feat 7</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Acrobat]]
**Prerequisites** [[Acrobat Dedication]]; master in [[Acrobatics]]

---
Mass and muscle are meaningless when you leap; only grace and balance matter. You can roll an [[Acrobatics]] check instead of an [[Athletics]] check when making a [[High Jump]] or [[Long Jump]].

## [[Show-Off]] <span class="action-icon">4</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Flourish</span>
**Source** [[Firebrands]]
**Archetype** [[Acrobat]]
**Frequency** once per minute
**Prerequisites** [[Acrobat Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You succeed at an [[Acrobatics]] or [[Athletics]] check deemed suitably challenging and meaningful by the GM.

---
As is the tradition with many Firebrands, you call your shot and look to impress with an extra bit of panache or a greater stunt. Attempt the triggering check again, using the second result. On a success, you gain the normal results of the check, plus you feel invigorated by your stunt and gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level (double your level on a critical success). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute. Typically, a challenging task is one with at least a standard DC for your level, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action's success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals.

## [[Tumbling Strike]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Flourish</span><span class="item-trait">Move</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Acrobat]]
**Prerequisites** [[Acrobat Dedication]]
**Requirements** You are adjacent to an enemy.

---
Attempt an Acrobatics check against the Reflex DC of an enemy adjacent to you.
**Critical Success** You move through the enemy's space to an unoccupied space on the other side of the enemy from your starting position. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can't move farther than your Speed, and you must end your movement adjacent to the enemy whose space you moved through. After moving, you make a melee Strike against the enemy whose space you moved through, and the enemy is [[Flat-Footed]] against that Strike.
**Success** As critical success, but the enemy isn't flat-footed against the Strike.
**Failure** You remain in your original space but can still Strike.
**Critical Failure** No effect.

## [[Mockingbird's Disarm]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You succeed at a check to [[Tumble Through]] or use [[Tumbling Strike]], and you moved through an enemy's space.

---
The Mockingbird is a master at running into foes and coming away with their weapons. Mimicking their skill, you strike at a foe's wrist while tumbling past them, weakening their grip. You attempt to [[Disarm]] the enemy whose space you moved through. You can use [[Acrobatics]] instead of [[Athletics]] for this check.

---
You use a burst of stamina to perform a breathtaking feat of [[Acrobatics]] as you speed through a foe's space, leaving your foe lying flat on their back. You attempt to [[Trip]] the enemy whose space you moved through. You can use Acrobatics instead of [[Athletics]] for this check.
