# Cleric

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
You are an ordained priest of your deity and have even learned how to cast a few divine spells. Though your main training lies elsewhere, your religious calling provides you divine gifts.

### Multiclass Cleric characters

The cleric archetype is a great way to create a character of another class who’s a devotee of a particular deity. The many domains available to clerics of different deities present a variety of options for focus spells.

* Alchemist clerics work well with the chirurgeon field, healing various ailments with either alchemy or spells. 
* Martial clerics are typically looking for a potent domain spell or some healing to use in a pinch. 
* Divine sorcerer clerics double down as the ultimate divine spellcasters. 
* Other spellcaster clerics diversify their options, becoming theurgic characters who combine two magical traditions.

You cast spells like a cleric. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity. You can prepare two common cantrips each day from the divine spell list in this book or any other divine cantrips you learn or discover. You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for divine spells. Your key spellcasting ability for cleric archetype spells is Wisdom, and they are divine cleric spells. Choose a deity as you would if you were a cleric. You become bound by that deity's anathema. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] and your deity's associated skill; for each of these skills in which you were already trained, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You don't gain any other abilities from your choice of deity.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the cleric archetype.
