# Eldritch Archer

## Elven Arrows

The ability to infuse eldritch energy into bow shots is often seen as a kind of [[Elf]] magic. While it may be true that elves first developed eldritch archery as a martial art, and many eldritch archers are elves and half-elves, other peoples have learned and developed their own forms of eldritch archery.
 Some whisper that remote regions to the south have their own dedications that rely on elemental archery, while the strange and shadowy hunters of the Uskwood use a form that relies on tenebrous shadow magic. Disturbing rumors circulate claiming that devils have developed a diabolical form of magical archery that can trap the soul and bind it to [[Hell]], albeit for a short time. Like any form of magic, the discipline of eldritch archery will continue to develop among its practitioners across the multiverse.

While many archers see their craft as an art form as much as a means of battle, a small number of archers seek to perfect their skills through magic, and you are among their number. Bolstering your athletic and martial abilities with mystical talents, you achieve rare heights with the bow or crossbow—transforming arrows or bolts into eldritch ammunition, sending arrows zig-zagging nearly unerringly to their target, and manifesting arrows that can deliver spells or even instant death.
 While having some spellcasting ability increases your potential flexibility and power as an eldritch archer, you might learn the secrets of these arts without being independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning the magic of the bow for its own sake.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

**Archetype** [[Eldritch Archer]]
**Prerequisites** expert in at least one type of [[Bow]]

---
You blend magic with your archery, leading to powerful results.
 If you don't already cast spells from spell slots, you learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the Cast a Spell activity. You gain a spell repertoire with one cantrip of your choice, from a spell list of your choice. You choose this cantrip from the common spells on your chosen spell list or from other spells to which you have access on that list. This cantrip must require a spell attack roll. You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for that tradition. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.
 You also gain Eldritch Shot.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Eldritch Shot **Requirements** You are wielding a [[Bow]]; **Effect** You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell do not occur immediately but are imbued into the bow you're wielding. Make a Strike with that bow. Your spell flies with the ammunition, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the penalty until after you've completed both attacks.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the eldritch archer archetype.

With a single whisper carried on the wind, you enchant your ammunition to make a foe more vulnerable to your attacks. Make a bow Strike. On a hit, the target takes an additional 2d6 mental damage. On a critical hit, the target also becomes [[Stunned]]. The mental damage increases to 3d6 if your bow has a [[Striking]] rune, or to 4d6 if your bow has a _major striking_ rune.

**Prerequisites** [[Eldritch Archer Dedication]]

You imbue your ammunition with eldritch power. When you select this feat, choose three types of common magical ammunition of 4th level or lower from the _Core Rulebook_ or this book. Your GM might allow you to choose from other types of magical ammunition, such as uncommon ammunition, or ammunition from other books.
 When using Magic Arrow, you transform a non-magical arrow or bolt into a piece of ammunition of one type you chose. You must shoot the ammunition before the end of your turn or the magic dissipates. If the ammunition has an Activate entry, you still need to spend the required actions to activate the ammunition before shooting it. When you use Magic Arrow, you can choose a type of magical ammunition that is typically not available to the type of ammunition you're using—for example, you can use [[Climbing Bolt]] on an arrow, even though that magical ammunition is normally only found on bolts.
**Special** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select three additional types of ammunition as described above.

---
You enchant a piece of ammunition with the magical essence of a precious material, allowing you to leverage certain creatures' weaknesses. Choose [[Cold Iron Weapon]] or [[Silver Weapon]]; if you shoot the arrow before the end of your turn, it counts as that material. At 14th level, add [[Adamantine Weapon]] to the list of materials you can choose from.

Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles to reach your target. Make a bow Strike against a foe you can see; the ammunition travels to your target, even around corners. You ignore the target's [[Concealed]] condition and all cover.

**Frequency** once per day
**Prerequisites** [[Eldritch Archer Dedication]]

---
You can concentrate an immense amount of magic to create a piece of ammunition that phases through everything but your target. Make a bow Strike against a foe who is [[Observed]] or [[Hidden]] to you (but not [[Undetected]]). The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers stop the arrow. The shot ignores all cover, the [[Concealed]] condition, the [[Hidden]] condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The Strike's damage can't be reduced with a [[Shield Block]] reaction using a non-magical shield.

---
You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in a single potent hit. Make a bow Strike. On a hit, you deal an additional 10d10 precision damage. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be immediately slain; this save has the death and incapacitation traits.

**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon with the volley trait and reload 0.
* This version of the Impossible Volley feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Impossible Volley]].

---
You fire a volley at all foes in an area. Make one Strike with a –2 penalty against each enemy within a 10-foot-radius burst centered at or beyond your weapon’s volley range. Roll the damage only once for all targets.
 Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but do not increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
