# Demolitionist

**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
As rippling explosions bring a castle's walls tumbling down, you grin and wipe the stone dust of your handiwork from your face. Brute force might work for others, but applying science to place the right explosives in just the right spot is essential to your craft.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Demolitionist Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>

You know how to set explosives to cause the maximum possible damage to buildings and other structures. You become trained in [[Lore]] or become an expert in it if you were already trained. You gain the Set Explosives action.
 **Set Explosives** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (concentrate) **Requirements** You have 1 or 2 bombs in hand; **Effect** You attach the bombs to an inanimate object within your reach, such as a door, wall, or column, and rig them to detonate at a set time. The bombs explode at a specific time you determine (such as after your next action or at the start of your next turn, to a maximum of 1 minute), dealing their damage and splash damage to the inanimate object. Combine this damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses, and this damage ignores an amount of the object's Hardness equal to your level. Any creatures adjacent to the hazard take the bombs' splash damage, also combined for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. As a reminder, since you didn't throw the bombs, [[Calculated Splash]] and similar effects don't apply. Making sure your timing is correct requires concentration, so you can't Set Explosives again while you're waiting for a previously set bomb to detonate.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the demolitionist archetype.

## [[Demolition Charge]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Alchemist</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Demolitionist]]
* This version of the Demolition Charge feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Demolition Charge]].

---
You can rig your bombs to inanimate objects in order to cause destruction to the surrounding area. As an activity that takes 1 minute, you attach between one and four bombs to an inanimate object within your reach, such as a chest, door, wall, or column. This creates a hazard in one square occupied by or adjacent to the inanimate object, and the hazard's [[Stealth]] DC to detect it and [[Thievery]] DC to disable it are equal to your class DC. The hazard has the following reaction, which you can also trigger as a single action so long as you are within 30 feet of the hazard. The hazard retains its potency until it's triggered, until the inanimate object moves from its space, or until you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Fire in the Hole **Trigger** A creature moves into the hazard's space; **Effect** The hazard explodes, dealing the bombs' damage and splash damage to the inanimate object. Combine this damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses, and this damage ignores an amount of the object's Hardness equal to your level. Any creatures adjacent to the hazard take the bombs' splash damage, similarly combined for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. As a reminder, since you didn't throw the bombs, Calculated Splash and similar effects don't apply.

## [[Safety Measures]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Archetype** [[Demolitionist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Demolitionist Dedication]]

---
You're often careful to be sure you're not hoisted on your own petard, or anyone else's, for that matter. When you have cover from a bomb, you gain resistance to damage caused by that bomb equal to half your level, plus a value equal to the circumstance bonus to AC granted by the cover. You gain these benefits against your own bombs regardless of whether you have cover.

## [[Calculated Splash]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Alchemist</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[Demolitionist]]
* This version of the Calculated Splash feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Calculated Splash]].

---
You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb’s splash. When you throw an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, you can cause the bomb to deal splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.

## [[Explosive Entry]] <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 7</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Archetype** [[Demolitionist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Demolitionist Dedication]]; master in [[Lore]]

---
You know exactly how to make a memorable entrance... by detonating a bomb to produce a devastating explosion, of course! You [[Demolitionist Dedication]] on a door, window, container, or heavy gate. When the explosives detonate, you can attempt an Engineering Lore check to [[Force Open]] the target. If a bomb would add an item bonus to attack rolls, add that item bonus to your Engineering Lore check. Since you're blasting your way in, you can't avoid breaking the object or structure. If you roll a critical success, you get a success instead.

## [[Controlled Blast]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Archetype** [[Demolitionist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Demolitionist Dedication]]; [[Calculated Splash]], [[Directional Bombs]], or [[Expanded Splash]]

---
You maximize the effectiveness of your explosives by controlling every possible parameter of the blast meticulously. If you have the Directional Bombs feats, you can use it with [[Demolitionist Dedication]] or Demolition Charge, even though you didn't throw the bombs. If you have the Calculated Splash or Expanded Splash feats, you can apply the additional splash damage to one of the bombs when you Set Explosives or use Demolition Charge, and you can apply the increased splash area from Expanded Splash to all the bombs.

## [[Directional Bombs]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Alchemist</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[Demolitionist]]
* This version of the Directional Bombs feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Directional Bombs]].

---
You can lob bombs with great force and a precise trajectory to angle the splash in a cone spraying in a single direction. When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can treat the target’s space as the first affected square of a 15-foot cone directed away from you, potentially allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. If the target takes up more than a single square, the target’s square closest to you is the first affected square of the cone.

## [[Collapse Wall]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 12</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
**Archetype** [[Demolitionist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Demolitionist Dedication]]
**Trigger** A creature moves into the bombs' splash area.
**Requirements** You're within 30 feet of an area where you rigged bombs on a wall, cliff face, or similar vertical surface with Set Explosives or Demolition Charge.

---
You detonate the required bombs in order to bring a wall down on a creature. If your bombs deal enough damage to reduce the wall's Hit Points below its Broken Threshold, the wall partially collapses on the creature. The creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to the damage dealt to the wall (basic Reflex save; the DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a failure, they must spend an Interact action to dig themselves out of the collapse, and on a critical failure, they must spend 2 Interact actions to do so.

## [[Expanded Splash]] <span class="item-type">Feat 12*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Alchemist</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[Demolitionist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Calculated Splash]]
* This version of the Expanded Splash feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Expanded Splash]].

The particularly volatile compounds that you brew into your bombs result in them creating especially large and powerful explosions. When you throw an alchemical bomb that has the splash trait, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the bomb’s usual splash damage, and it deals splash damage to every creature within 10 feet of the target.
