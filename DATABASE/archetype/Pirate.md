# Pirate

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You live a life of freedom, taking by force and intimidation all that you desire. You may be a privateer, raiding and plundering on behalf of a particular nation or another authority, or you may answer to no one but your own capricious whims. Either way, you rely on intimidation, wits, and combat prowess to take what you want from those you deem less deserving.
 Pirates have much in common with swashbucklers, and many pirates have the [[DATABASE/class_/Swashbuckler|swashbuckler]] class or [[DATABASE/archetype/Swashbuckler|archetype]]. Much like a swashbuckler's daring deeds, classic pirate maneuvers are often showy feats intended to impress, intimidate, and gain panache. For example, if you have the panache class feature and your [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check for a [[DATABASE/feat/Pirate Dedication|Boarding Assault]] exceeds the very hard DC for your level, you would gain panache.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to plunder. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Sailing Lore]], or become an expert in it if you were already trained. You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground caused by a ship's movement. Additionally, you gain the Boarding Assault action.
**Boarding Assault** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (Flourish) Either Stride twice or attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check (DC determined by the GM, but usually DC 20) to swing on a rope up to twice your Speed. If you boarded or disembarked from a boat or similar vehicle during this movement, you can make a melee Strike that deals one additional weapon damage die.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the pirate archetype.

Shimali Manux trains every Salt Breaker to fight in the cramped quarters below deck, and you've learned how to use these techniques with your crew. During your daily preparations, you can name up to five crewmates you will be working with that day. If an enemy is within reach of you and at least two of your crewmates, that enemy is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against you.

You're particularly skilled at wielding traditional pirate weapons. You become trained with the following weapons: [[DATABASE/weapon/Hatchet|hatchet]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Rapier|rapier]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Scimitar|scimitar]], and [[DATABASE/weapon/Whip|whip]]. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank for these weapons.

**Prerequisites** trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]]; [[DATABASE/feat/Pirate Dedication|Pirate Dedication]]

---
You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only on ship's rigging or similar ropes. Whenever you succeed at an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Climb|Climb]] a rope or an [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Balance|Balance]] on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You aren't [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] while Climbing or Balancing on a rope.

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Dandy Dedication|Dandy Dedication]], or [[DATABASE/feat/Pirate Dedication|Pirate Dedication]]; trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.

---
Repeated entries in Firebrand bragging and flyting contests have taught you how to twist pretty words into concealed insults. When you succeed at your check to [[DATABASE/action/Coerce|Coerce]] a creature, the target's attitude toward you improves by one step, to a maximum of [[DATABASE/condition/Friendly|friendly]], and they don't become [[DATABASE/condition/Unfriendly|unfriendly]] 1 day later.

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Duelist Dedication|Duelist Dedication]]; [[DATABASE/feat/Pirate Dedication|Pirate Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** An ally misses or critically misses an enemy you can see with their attack.

---
A common saying among Firebrands is, “There's always a fool who thinks they can do it better—and they're often right.” You verbally commit to using an action on your next turn to make a melee Strike against the same enemy your ally has missed. If your attack hits, you deal additional damage equal to twice the number of damage dice.

## [[DATABASE/feat/Walk the Plank|Walk the Plank]] <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Pirate|Pirate]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Pirate Dedication|Pirate Dedication]]

---
You frighten a foe into moving where you want them, traditionally demanding they walk the plank. Attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] an opponent; this check gains the incapacitation trait. On a success, in addition to the normal effects, you can also force the target to Stride up to its Speed. You choose the path the target takes, and it does so as part of your Walk the Plank action. You can't force the target to move into a harmful space (one where it will take damage, fall, provoke reactions, or similar) unless the result of your check to Demoralize was a critical success. The target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank for 24 hours.

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Flourish</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Firebrands|Firebrands]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Pirate|Pirate]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Pirate Dedication|Pirate Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Requirements** A rope is within your reach, or you have a [[DATABASE/equipment/Rope|rope]] or grappling weapon in your hand.

---
The Salt Breakers learned to use whatever they could during the Vidric Revolution, and they quickly mastered the art of making a rope into a useful tool in combat. You take hold of a nearby rope, throw a rope from your hand, or fire a grappling weapon at a solid surface—and then swing up to twice your Speed. If you end your movement next to an enemy, attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] that enemy, tying them up in your rope.
