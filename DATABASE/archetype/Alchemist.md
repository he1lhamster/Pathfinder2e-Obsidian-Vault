# Alchemist

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
You enjoy tinkering with alchemical formulas and substances in your spare time, and your studies have progressed beyond mere experimentation.

### Multiclass Alchemist characters

The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype are extremely useful to characters of any class. The following are just some of the possible combinations.

* Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their rage to ferocious effect. 
* Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their champion’s reaction and lay on hands to go further. 
* Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain additional options in situations where their usual tactics don’t work. 
* Ranger alchemists focus on alchemy and snares, getting extra use out of their Crafting skill and supplying bombs for the bomb snare. 
* Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue’s poison feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an interesting way to sneak attack with various types of energy damage. 
* Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can brew up darksight elixirs to grant darkvision can prepare another spell instead of [[DATABASE/spell/Darkvision|darkvision]].

You also gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] feat and four additional formulas for 1st-level alchemical items, as well as the ability to create free items during your daily preparations. Your advanced alchemy level is 1 and doesn’t increase on its own.
