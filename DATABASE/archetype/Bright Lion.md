You become trained in your choice of [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] and in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Mzali Lore]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to [[DATABASE/action/Lie|Lie]] or [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] to pass yourself off as a worshipper of [[DATABASE/deity/Walkena|Walkena]]. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.

You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Slippery Secrets|Slippery Secrets]] skill feat, and its benefits also apply against divination effects that attempt to discern your deity. When using Slippery Secrets against a divine divination, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and on a critical success, the divination reveals false information appropriate to your false persona, rather than nothing.
