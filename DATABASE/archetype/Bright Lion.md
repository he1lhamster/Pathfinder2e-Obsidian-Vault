**Archetype** [[Bright Lion]]
**Prerequisites** member of the Bright Lions; not a worshipper of [[Walkena]]; trained in [[Stealth]]
**Access** [[Bright Lion]] background

---
You become trained in your choice of [[Deception]] or [[Diplomacy]] and in [[Lore]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to [[Lie]] or [[Impersonate]] to pass yourself off as a worshipper of [[Walkena]]. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.

The Old Sun Gods share their power with you. Select the [[Ambition Domain]], [[Cities Domain]], [[Darkness Domain]], [[Dreams Domain]], [[Family Domain]], [[Fire Domain]], [[Freedom Domain]], [[Healing Domain]], [[Moon Domain]], [[Passion Domain]], or [[Sun Domain]] domain. You gain an initial domain spell for that domain. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [[Refocus]] activity to pray to the Old Sun Gods; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your Bright Lion focus spells are divine spells; you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability score.
**Special** You can select this feat multiple times, selecting a different domain each time and gaining its domain spell.

You gain a tattoo that serves as a special ward to defend you against [[Walkena]] forces. The tattoo allows you to cast the [[Light]] cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. The cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. If you die, the tattoo immediately casts [[Gentle Repose]] on your corpse, heightened to the same spell level.

You are able to escape inquisitions involving divine magic, allowing you to blend in well in Mzali but also to avoid unwanted attention in other oppressive theocracies. You gain the [[Slippery Secrets]] skill feat, and its benefits also apply against divination effects that attempt to discern your deity. When using Slippery Secrets against a divine divination, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and on a critical success, the divination reveals false information appropriate to your false persona, rather than nothing.
