# Duelist

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Across the world, students in martial academies practice with their blades to master one-on-one combat. The libraries of such schools hold deep troves of information detailing hundreds of combat techniques, battle stances, and honorable rules of engagement. Those who gain admission to such schools might train in formalized duels—and that's certainly the more genteel route to take. However, others assert that there's no better place to try out dueling techniques than in the life-and-death struggles common to an adventurer's life.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

**Archetype** [[Duelist]]
**Prerequisites** trained in light armor and simple weapons

---
You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel, no matter the circumstances. You gain the [[Quick Draw]] ranger feat, enabling you to both draw and attack with a weapon as 1 action. This serves as Quick Draw for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the duelist archetype.

**Archetype** [[Duelist]]
**Requirements** You are wielding only a single one-handed melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.

You can parry attacks against you with your one-handed weapon. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn as long as you continue to meet the requirements.

**Archetype** [[Duelist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Duelist Dedication]]

---
Select one foe that you can see and proclaim a challenge. That foe is your dueling opponent until they are defeated, flee, or the encounter ends. Any time you hit that enemy using a single one-handed melee weapon while your other hand or hands are free, you gain a circumstance bonus to the Strike's damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals.
 If you attack a creature other than your dueling opponent, you take a circumstance penalty to damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals.

**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You hit a creature with a melee attack roll.

---
The Sapphire Butterfly is not one for violence when simply intimidating a foe will do. From that vigilante's techniques, you've learned how to pull a deadly blow at the last moment, threatening your target instead of striking them. Rather than dealing damage with the triggering Strike, attempt an [[Intimidation]] check with a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet who can see you. If you critically succeed at your check to Demoralize the target of your Strike, their attitude toward you improves by one step while they also become [[Frightened]].

**Trigger** An ally misses or critically misses an enemy you can see with their attack.

---
A common saying among Firebrands is, “There's always a fool who thinks they can do it better—and they're often right.” You verbally commit to using an action on your next turn to make a melee Strike against the same enemy your ally has missed. If your attack hits, you deal additional damage equal to twice the number of damage dice.

You protect those near you with a flash of steel. When you're benefiting from [[Dueling Parry (Fighter)]], allies adjacent to you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. If you have [[Dueling Riposte]], you can use it when an enemy within your reach critically fails a Strike against an ally adjacent to you, not just against yourself.

After your initial attack redirects your foe's defenses, your follow-up wrests their weapon from their grasp. Make a melee Strike with the required weapon. In addition to its other effects, this Strike gains the success and critical success effects of the [[Disarm]] action. The Strike also has the following failure effect.
**Failure** The target is flat-footed until the end of your current turn.

You have studied a great many combat techniques, which you can review each day. During your daily preparations, you can swap out any number of your duelist archetype feats for other duelist archetype feats of the appropriate level for which you are qualified. You can't swap out [[Duelist Dedication]] or Student of the Dueling Arts in this way.
 In addition, you can enter a stance from a duelist archetype feat you don't have (such as one listed under Additional Feats) by increasing the number of actions it takes to enter the stance by 1 (typically to 2 actions). You must still meet the feat's prerequisites.
