# Lich

## Soul Cage

The _[[DATABASE/equipment/Soul Cage|soul cage]]_ for the lich archetype is very similar to the [[DATABASE/equipment/Lich Soul Cage|lich soul cage]] from the _Pathfinder Bestiary_ but has a few modifications to cover situations that might come up in play.
 While the story of the PCs sneaking in to destroy the NPC lich's _soul cage_ is classic, it's difficult to have NPC adversaries do the same to the PC lich's _soul cage_ without coming across poorly, similar to destroying a PC wizard's spellbook while it was off screen. Since that's the only way to defeat a lich, these table-dynamic concerns might effectively grant the lich PC immortality. Because of the way that changes the story and game play, even a group using the other undead archetypes in this book might want to consider whether or not to include the lich archetype. If you're looking for a compromise, consider having the _soul cage_ act similarly to a [[DATABASE/feat/Rejuvenation Token|Rejuvenation Token]], requiring a ritual to awaken the lich's soul from within the cage.

The path to [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Lich|lichdom]] is long and winding, with many pitfalls that overcome all but the most accomplished and precise spellcasters. Despite the trials you underwent and decades spent sequestered away with magical tomes, you know with every fiber of your being that it's all been worth it. You devised a unique and incredibly evil ritual to tear your soul from your body, and you painstakingly crafted a receptacle to house your freed soul. Immortality now lies within your grasp.
 Becoming a lich requires much more than just magical knowledge. It demands fierce intelligence, bold ingenuity, incredible determination, unending patience, and a strict adherence to perfection, along with incredible skill as an artisan, for each lich must create their own _soul cage_. A mispronounced word or flaw in the construction of your _soul cage_ would end not in immortality but ignominious death. You have all these skills in abundance and now, with your ascension, you've proven your superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt.
 As a lich, you understand better than any the power and potential of magic. Many liches strive to increase their magical skills and foil the magic of any who dare oppose them. Others delve so deeply into necromantic arts and foul rituals that their flesh can burn the living, causing biological processes to falter and filling those who behold them with uncontrollable fear.
 Regardless of what paths they pursue, nearly all liches are obsessed with their _soul cage_, spending untold hours and a veritable fortune to protect it, surrounding it with magical and mundane hazards, and guarding it with powerful, loyal defenders. Some liches prefer to secure their _soul cage_ through obscurity rather than force, enshrouding it in magical abjurations or illusions to hide it from prying eyes. The most gifted crafters among liches tinker and improve their _soul cage_ over time, rendering it nigh indestructible. This is a dangerous proposition, undertaken by only the most confident and arrogant magical engineers, as physically altering one's _soul cage_ could have unintended consequences on its function. Many [[DATABASE/class_/Wizard|wizard]] liches instead learn to tap into the _soul cage_'s magical energy from afar to fuel their own spellcasting.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

After years of study and careful planning, you finally completed a _soul cage_ to house your soul and successfully performed a ritual to transform yourself into a lich. Now, neither death nor time can prevent you from pursuing your studies and achieving your grand ambitions. You gain the undead trait and the basic undead benefits. Your undead craving is for knowledge.
 You gain a unique [[DATABASE/equipment/Soul Cage|soul cage]]—a magic item that houses your soul. Whenever you would die, your soul flees to the _soul cage_ to allow you to be rebuilt. As long as your soul cage exists, you can't truly be destroyed.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the lich archetype.

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/action/Drain Bonded Item|Drain Bonded Item]], spellbook; [[DATABASE/feat/Lich Dedication|Lich Dedication]]

---
You make your [[DATABASE/equipment/Soul Cage|soul cage]] into your bonded item, allowing you to harness its abundant magical energy. Once per day, when you use Drain Bonded Item, you can choose any spell in your spellbook that you can cast, even if you haven't prepared or cast it that day. Your _soul cage_ doesn't need to be on your person for you to use Drain Bonded Item. If your _soul cage_ is broken or destroyed, you can't use Drain Soul Cage. Even if you can Drain Bonded Item more than once per day, for instance if you are a universalist wizard, you can still only choose a spell you haven't prepared and cast once per day.

You wreathe your [[DATABASE/equipment/Soul Cage|soul cage]] in an ever-growing collection of obfuscating illusions and protective abjurations to hide it from your enemies. You disguise the _soul cage_ as any non-magical object of the same Bulk, and it gains the effects of the [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Aura|magic aura]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Nondetection|nondetection]] spells. The effects have unlimited durations, are heightened to half your level rounded up, and use your spell DC against any attempt to counteract them. The magic aura makes your _soul cage_ appear non-magical. You can ignore the effects of any of these spells when dealing with your own _soul cage_. You are mentally alerted whenever your _soul cage_ is damaged.

Negative energy intensifies your undead form and makes your very touch the antithesis of life. You gain the advanced undead benefits. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4, it deals negative damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and it loses the nonlethal trait. Your fist becomes magical.
 When you critically hit a living creature with your fist Strike, the creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]] until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your spell DC. This is a critical specialization effect.

You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Magic|detect magic]] spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.
**Special** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).

Your constant efforts to augment and perfect your [[DATABASE/equipment/Soul Cage|soul cage]] have bolstered its efficiency. Your _soul cage_ has Hardness equal to your level and HP equal to four times your level. The time it takes your _soul cage_ to rebuild your body is reduced to 1d6 days rather than 1d10 days.
 At 20th level, the time it takes your _soul cage_ to rebuild your body is reduced to 2d12+12 hours.

Inspired by the degenerate [[DATABASE/monster/Demilich|demiliches]] your kind sometimes devolves into, you've embedded a gem into your brow, fusing it to your necrotic flesh. This gem has been specially calibrated to hold one of the following spells: [[DATABASE/spell/Repulsion|repulsion]], [[DATABASE/spell/Scrying|scrying]], or [[DATABASE/spell/True Seeing|true seeing]]. You must decide which spell your gem contains when you take this feat; changing the spell requires retraining the feat. Once per day, you can drain the gem's magical energy to Cast the Spell without spending a spell slot.
 At 18th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 7th level. At 20th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 8th level; regardless of which spell you chose, you can instead drain the gem's magical energy to cast an 8th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Spell Turning|spell turning]] without spending a spell slot.

You're surrounded by a palpable sense of menace and power that's terrifying to behold. The aura is a 15-foot emanation. An enemy that enters or ends its turn in the aura must attempt a Will save against the higher of your spell DC or class DC.
**Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to your Frightful Aura for 1 minute.
**Failure** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]].
**Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 2.
