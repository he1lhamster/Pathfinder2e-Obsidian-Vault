# Loremaster

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Knowledge is power, and you labor in pursuit of that power. No matter the situation, you can usually procure some tidbit of knowledge to inform your actions. You specialize in secrets, both uncovering them and hiding them away, and your command of the written word borders on the supernatural. As you discover deeper secrets of lore, you might develop a power over knowledge that becomes outright magical, allowing you to understand and disguise information even more effectively.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Loremaster Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Loremaster]]
**Prerequisites** trained in at least one skill to [[Decipher Writing]]

---
You've compiled a vast repository of information that touches on nearly every subject. You are trained in [[Lore]], a special Lore skill that can be used only to [[Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic. If you have legendary proficiency in a skill used to [[Decipher Writing]], you gain expert proficiency in Loremaster Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Loremaster Lore by any other means. You can take feats in the loremaster's additional feats entry even if you don't meet the enigma muse prerequisite. 
If you have the [[Bardic Lore]] class feat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with Bardic Lore.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the loremaster archetype.

## [[Orthographic Mastery]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>

**Archetype** [[Loremaster]]
**Prerequisites** [[Loremaster Dedication]]

During your daily preparations, you can study a particular subject to gain the trained proficiency rank in one [[Lore]] skill of your choice. You must have interacted with that subject in some way on the previous day, whether by reading about it, talking to someone knowledgeable on the topic, or experiencing it yourself. Alternatively, you can reference your notes to instead choose a Lore skill you've prepared before with Quick Study. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Loremaster]]
**Prerequisites** [[Enigma]]
* This version of the Assured Knowledge feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Assured Knowledge]].

---
You can procure information with confidence. Whenever you [[Recall Knowledge]] using any skill (including [[Bardic Lore]]), you can forgo rolling your check to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (don't apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers). As long as you are an expert in a skill, you meet the prerequisites for the [[Automatic Knowledge]] skill feat in that skill, even if you don't have [[Assurance]] in that skill.

## [[Enigma's Knowledge]] <span class="item-type">Feat 14*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Bard</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]]

**Prerequisites** [[Assured Knowledge]]
* This version of the Enigma's Knowledge feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Enigma's Knowledge]].

---
Your muse whispers knowledge to you at all the right times. You gain the benefits of the [[Automatic Knowledge]] skill feat with any skill you can use to [[Recall Knowledge]]. As per the special clause in the Automatic Knowledge feat, you can still only use Automatic Knowledge once per round.

## [[True Hypercognition]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 16*</span>

Your mind works at an incredible pace. You instantly use up to five Recall Knowledge actions. If you have any special abilities or free actions that would normally be triggered when you Recall Knowledge, you can’t use them for these actions.
