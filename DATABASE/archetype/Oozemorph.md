# Oozemorph

**Source** [[The Slithering]]
You have suffered from the deadly touch of an ooze or other amorphous creature, like a [[Gibbering Mouther]] or a [[Shoggoth]], and have come away changed. Alternatively, you might have been exposed to some alchemical accident involving experiments with oozes, such as those performed in the city of Oenopion in Nex. Parts of your body occasionally liquefy and threaten to slough off, and only through force of will can you keep your natural form intact. Your affliction is plainly supernatural in origin and distressingly permanent.

## [[Oozemorph Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[Oozemorph]]

---
You are plagued by sporadic anatomical rearrangements, which grant you insights into other creatures with unusual anatomies. You become trained in [[Occultism]] and Ooze Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves to avoid being [[Engulf]] by creatures, and to checks to [[Escape]] after being Engulfed.
 As you develop more abilities based on your amorphous affliction, you become increasingly off-putting to mundane creatures. You take a penalty to [[Diplomacy]] checks against animals and humanoids. This penalty is equal to your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype, to a maximum of –4 for four or more feats.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the oozemorph archetype.

## [[Disturbing Defense]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[Oozemorph]]
**Prerequisites** [[Oozemorph Dedication]]

---
Your internal organs and blood vessels have shifted and changed, and even you don't know precisely where in your body they are. You gain resistance to precision damage equal to 2 + your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype. The DC of your flat checks to recover from [[Persistent Damage]] is 13, rather than 15.

## [[Hideous Ululation]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>
**Source** [[The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[Oozemorph]]
**Prerequisites** [[Oozemorph Dedication]]; trained in [[Performance]]

---
Your throat has multiple separate chambers that can give your voice an eerie echo. You can be clearly heard at distances of up to 300 feet regardless of ambient sound, although your voice doesn't penetrate a magical [[Silence]] effect.

## [[Vacate Vision]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[Oozemorph]]
**Prerequisites** [[Oozemorph Dedication]]
**Trigger** You fail (but don't critically fail) a saving throw against an effect with the visual trait.

---
You cause your eyes to liquefy and run out of your eye sockets, leaving them empty. You get a success on the save against the triggering effect, but you are [[Blinded]] for the duration the effect would have had on a failure. At that time, your eyes regrow and your normal vision returns.

## [[Ooze Empathy]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[Oozemorph]]
**Prerequisites** [[Oozemorph Dedication]]; at least two other class feats from the oozemorph archetype

---
You can connect with oozes (and other amorphous aberrations, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make an Impression]] on oozes and to make very simple [[Request]] of them. In most instances, oozes will give you time to make your case.

## [[Rubbery Skin]] <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[Oozemorph]]
**Prerequisites** [[Disturbing Defense]]

---
Your skin develops a malleable, rubbery quality. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 2 + your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype. You also gain resistance equal to twice that amount to extra damage from critical hits; if the resistance is greater than the extra damage, it reduces the extra damage to 0 but doesn't reduce the attack's normal damage.

## [[Uncanny Suction]] <span class="item-type">Feat 12</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[Oozemorph]]
**Prerequisites** [[Oozemorph Dedication]]

---
Your limbs produce strange, sucker-like growths that allow you to adhere to walls, objects, and most other surfaces. You gain a climb Speed equal to your half your land Speed (minimum 5 feet). If you have the [[Quick Climb]] feat, your climb Speed is equal to your land Speed. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC to avoid being [[Disarm]].

## [[Peculiar Anatomy]] <span class="item-type">Feat 14</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[The Slithering]]
**Archetype** [[Oozemorph]]
**Prerequisites** [[Disturbing Defense]]

---
Your circulatory system contains viscous protoplasmic fluid instead of ordinary blood. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against disease and poison, and resistance to poison damage equal to half your level.
 In addition, your resistance to precision damage from Disturbing Defense increases to an amount equal to 7 + your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype, and the DC of your flat checks to recover from [[Persistent Damage]] is 8 rather than 13.
