**Prerequisites** evil alignment; trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]]

---
You have a connection to mindless undead that allows you to communicate your intentions to them on a rudimentary level. You can use [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on mindless undead and to make very simple [[DATABASE/action/Request|Requests]] of them; their mindless trait doesn't grant immunity to these mental effects. Most mindless undead are likely [[DATABASE/condition/Hostile|hostile]] toward you by default and must be kept at a safe distance to give you time to Make an Impression.
 You become trained in Diplomacy; if already trained, you instead become trained in another skill of your choice.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the corpse tender archetype.

You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Command Undead|Command Undead]] feat, but you can use it only to transform the effects of _harm_ spells you cast on mindless undead. These spells can control creatures with a level equal to or lower than your level – 1 (instead of your level – 3).

When you use [[DATABASE/feat/Command Undead|Command Undead]] on a mindless undead, if the undead succeeds at its save but doesn't critically succeed, it becomes your minion for 1 round. If the undead fails its save, it becomes your minion for 1 hour. If it critically fails, it becomes your minion for 24 hours.

---
You grasp the mind of an undead creature and temporarily wipe it as empty as a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Zombie|zombie's]] brain. You can target any undead with your divine innate [[DATABASE/spell/Harm|harm]] spell, not just mindless undead. When you target one non-mindless undead creature with this spell, you can transform its effects. Instead of harm's normal effects, the target must attempt a Will save.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Stupefied|stupefied 1]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is stupefied 2 for 1 minute. While it is stupefied, you can use your Corpse Tender feats on the target as though it were mindless.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is stupefied 3 for 10 minutes.
