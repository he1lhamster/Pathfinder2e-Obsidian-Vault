# Viking

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
To go “a-viking” is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or, as they call it, the “whale-road”) to ambush coastal communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering all they can find and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Viking Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Viking]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Athletics]]

---
Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm. You're trained in [[Lore]]. When moving through water using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success for your [[Athletics]] check to [[Swim]], you get a critical success instead.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the viking archetype.

## [[Hurling Charge]] <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Viking]]
**Prerequisites** [[Viking Dedication]]

---
You make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon you already have in your hand, Stride, and then Interact to draw another weapon. If you are raging, you can add the additional damage with melee weapons you receive from raging to your damage with the thrown weapon.

## [[Reactive Shield]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Fighter</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[Viking]]
**Trigger** An enemy hits you with a melee Strike.
**Requirements** You are wielding a shield.
* This version of the Reactive Shield feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Reactive Shield]].

---
You can snap your shield into place just as you would take a blow, avoiding the hit at the last second. You immediately use the [[Raise a Shield]] action and gain your shield's bonus to AC. The circumstance bonus from the shield applies to your AC when you're determining the outcome of the triggering attack.

## [[Viking Weapon Familiarity]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Viking]]
**Prerequisites** [[Viking Dedication]]

---
From childhood, you have been exposed to traditional viking weapons, and you soon learned to handle them in battle. Now, you can raid proudly alongside your fellows. You are trained with the [[Battle Axe]], [[Hatchet]], [[Longsword]], and [[Shortsword]]. In addition, you gain the [[Shield Block]] reaction.

## [[Second Shield]] <span class="action-icon">4</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Viking]]
**Prerequisites** [[Viking Dedication]]
**Trigger** Your [[Shield Block]] causes your shield to break or be destroyed.

---
You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself. You can Interact to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield—for example, a table or chair— you can Interact to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield. Your new shield isn't raised until you use the [[Raise a Shield]] action, as normal.

## [[Shielded Stride]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Fighter</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Bastion]], [[Viking]]
* This version of the Shielded Stride feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Shielded Stride]].

---
When your shield is up, your enemies' blows can't touch you. When you have your shield raised, you can Stride to move half your Speed without triggering reactions that are triggered by your movement (such as [[Attack of Opportunity]]). You can use Shielded Stride while [[Fly]] or [[Swim]] instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.

## [[Viking Weapon Specialist]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Viking]]
**Prerequisites** [[Viking Weapon Familiarity]]

---
You are even more skilled in the weapons of your people. You gain the critical specialization effects of the [[Battle Axe]], [[Hatchet]], [[Longsword]], and [[Shortsword]]. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in the above four weapons.

## [[Viking Vindicator]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
**Archetype** [[Viking]]
**Prerequisites** [[Viking Dedication]]
**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

---
You are one of the raiders eagerly planning to launch an assault by sea on the Whispering Tyrant's Isle of Terror. You gain the [[Sudden Charge]] fighter feat, though it's a viking feat for you instead. As normal when gaining an additional feat from an archetype feat, gaining Sudden Charge doesn't count toward fulfilling the special requirement for Viking Dedication. If you already had Sudden Charge, you can retrain it as part of gaining this feat. When you use Sudden Charge to Strike a target in shallow water, the target is [[Flat-Footed]] against your Strike, as you use the water kicked up by your passage to camouflage your angle of attack. If you have [[Viking Weapon Familiarity]] or [[Viking Weapon Specialist]], add the [[Bastard Sword]] and [[Rapier]] to the list of weapons in those feats.

## [[Quick Shield Block]] <span class="item-type">Feat 10*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Champion</span><span class="item-trait">Fighter</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Bastion]], [[Viking]]
**Prerequisites** [[Shield Block]]
* This version of the Quick Shield Block feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Quick Shield Block]].

---
You can bring your shield into place with hardly a thought. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to Shield Block.
