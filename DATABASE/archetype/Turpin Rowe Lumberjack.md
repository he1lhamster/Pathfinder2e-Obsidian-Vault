**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Turpin Rowe Lumberjack|Turpin Rowe Lumberjack]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]]
**Access** You must befriend at least one Turpin Rowe logger.

---
Your logging training has made you intimately familiar with all aspects of forestry, and you have trained extensively to reach around trees and utilize their bulk to your advantage. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Milling Lore]] and Forest Lore, or an expert if you were already trained. You can always [[DATABASE/action/Take Cover|Take Cover]] when you are within forest terrain to gain cover, even if you’re not next to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind. In addition, any enemy who gains standard cover from a tree gains only lesser cover against your attacks (or only standard cover, if the enemy otherwise gains greater cover).
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Turpin Rowe lumberjack archetype.

When you are climbing a wooden surface and have a [[DATABASE/weapon/Hatchet|hatchet]] or [[DATABASE/weapon/Battle Axe|battle axe]] in each hand, you have a climb Speed equal to half your normal Speed. You must still have both legs available to climb and can’t use either of the axes in combat while climbing. This feat can also be used to climb a surface of ice if you have a [[DATABASE/weapon/Light Pick|light pick]] in each hand.

You have mastered the weight and balance of a variety of axes and can lob them with ease. Any one-handed axe weapon you wield has the thrown trait with a range of 10 feet. For axes that already have the thrown trait, the range increases by 10 feet. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a thrown axe weapon, you apply the axe’s critical specialization effect.

Once you have penetrated a foe’s defenses, you can home in on the same spot to exploit your opponent’s wound and deal some serious damage. The second time you hit and deal damage with a melee axe Strike to the same opponent or object during your turn, you ignore half of the opponent’s or object’s Hardness, if any. If you hit and deal damage with a melee axe Strike to the same opponent or object a third or fourth time during your turn, you ignore all of its Hardness, if any.
