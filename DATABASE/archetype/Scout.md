# Scout

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You're an expert in espionage and reconnaissance, able to skulk silently through the wilderness to gather intelligence, sneak through enemy lines to report to your comrades, or suddenly and decisively strike your foes. Your skills ease the difficulty of travel for you and your companions and keep you all on guard when you're approaching danger.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Scout Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Stealth]] and [[Survival]]

---
You are a highly skilled scout, capable of providing your allies a timely warning of any danger. You gain the [[Scout's Warning]] ranger feat. When you're using the [[Scout]] exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scout archetype.

## [[Eclipsed Vitality]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>
**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
**Archetypes** [[Assassin]], [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** [[Assassin Dedication]], or [[Scout Dedication]]; master in [[Stealth]]
**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

---
You shroud yourself in ashes that hide the vital essence sought by life-sensing undead. You're always taking precautions when [[Avoid Notice]], [[Hide]], and [[Sneak]] to foil [[Lifesense]], and you're [[Concealed]] to any creature using only precise lifesense to observe you.

## [[Rebel's Map]] <span class="action-icon">4</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Firebrands]]
**Archetypes** [[Horizon Walker]], [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** [[Horizon Walker Dedication]], or [[Scout Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You roll initiative.

---
Rebellions require an intricate knowledge of one's surroundings—because you might need to escape at any moment. You remember the locations of escape routes, ambush spots, and cover from a scouting expedition or a previous visit to the area. Roll a d20. At any point during the subsequent combat, you can substitute the result of this roll instead of rolling a d20 on one [[Deception]] check to [[Create a Diversion]] or on one [[Stealth]] check to [[Hide]].

## [[Scout's Charge]] <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Flourish</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** [[Scout Dedication]]

---
You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. Stride, [[Feint]] against that opponent, and then make a Strike against that foe. For your Feint, you can attempt a [[Stealth]] check instead of the [[Deception]] check that's usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard.

## [[Terrain Scout]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** [[Scout Dedication]]

---
You gain the [[Terrain Stalker]] skill feat twice, choosing a different terrain each time. If you [[Avoid Notice]] while exploring and any allies use [[Follow the Expert]] to follow you as you do so, you can choose one of those allies to gain the benefit of any one Terrain Stalker feat you have.

## [[Fleeting Shadow]] <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Flourish</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** [[Scout Dedication]]

---
You're able to quickly disappear and then move about stealthily. You [[Hide]], then [[Sneak]] twice.

## [[Scout's Speed]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** [[Scout Dedication]]

---
You move faster, especially when traveling, allowing you to scout ahead and report back without slowing your allies. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed. When calculating your travel speed, this increases to a +20-foot status bonus.

## [[Scout's Pounce]] <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Flourish</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** [[Scout Dedication]]
**Requirements** You are [[Hidden]] from or [[Undetected]] by all of your opponents, and you aren't within 10 feet of any enemy.

---
You leap from the shadows to strike your foes. Stride up to your Speed, then Strike twice. If you were hidden or [[Unnoticed]] by the target of these Strikes, your foe is [[Flat-Footed]] against both attacks. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally for both attacks.

## [[Camouflage]] <span class="item-type">Feat 12*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Ranger</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Knight Reclaimant]], [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** master in [[Stealth]]
* This version of the Camouflage feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Camouflage]].

---
You alter your appearance to blend in to the wilderness. In natural terrain, you can [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]] even without cover or being [[Concealed]].
