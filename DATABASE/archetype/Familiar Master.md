# Familiar Master

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
From the wise owl perched on the wizard's shoulder to the crafty gremlin that serves the witch for their own reasons, the ghastly homunculus in the alchemist's lab to the clever monkey that picks the lock of the thief's cell, familiars have always served. Whether through rigorous training or a preternatural connection, yours serves better than most.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Familiar Master Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>

**Archetype** [[Familiar Master]]

---
You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as meditating under the moon until something crept out of the forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued in turn. Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the end. You gain a familiar. If you already have a familiar, you gain the [[Enhanced Familiar]] feat.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the familiar master archetype.

* This version of the Enhanced Familiar feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Enhanced Familiar]].

---
You infuse your familiar with additional magical energy. You can select four familiar or master abilities each day, instead of two.
**Special**
 (Wizard) If your arcane thesis is [[Improved Familiar Attunement]], your familiar's base number of familiar abilities, before adding any extra abilities from the arcane thesis, is four.
(Witch) Add the bonus familiar abilities you gain for being a witch to this amount.

Under your tutelage, your familiar has grown attuned to the hidden currents of the world and can serve as a conduit for your magic. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has a range, the spell uses the familiar as its origin point.

Your familiar is the heart and soul of your adventuring team. When selecting master abilities, you can choose an ally to benefit from any specific master ability. Each master ability can benefit only a single character, and you can select a specific master ability only once unless the ability says otherwise.

Your familiar's supernatural spirit has outgrown its corporeal body. You can conduct a special 10-minute activity to reselect certain familiar abilities, switching one or more of the following abilities for other abilities on this list: [[Amphibious]], [[Burrower]], [[Climber]], [[Darkvision]], [[Fast Movement]], [[Manual Dexterity]], [[Resistance]], and [[Scent]]. You can reselect only familiar abilities you would normally be able to reselect each day, not required familiar abilities for your familiar. You can't remove an ability that is required for another ability your familiar has (for instance, you can't remove manual dexterity if the familiar has [[Lab Assistant]]).
