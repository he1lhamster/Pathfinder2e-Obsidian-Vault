# Elementalist

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]], [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
You revere the elements as the building blocks of creation and the source of all life. You believe that by balancing, mixing, and rearranging these elements, magic is made. This belief has led you to eschew traditional magical theories and divisions, and you instead focus on harnessing, manipulating, and shaping the elements. There are many paths to elementalism, and many classes can become elementalists. As the most basic building blocks of matter, the elements can be shaped to your specific training and understanding. The study of elementalism expands every day.
 You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace either the philosophy of four elements common in the Inner Sea or the five-element cycle prevalent in Tian Xia. This is often a balance, but some elementalists feel a stronger connection to a singular element that they hone to great heights, utilizing the other elements to support and augment their favored.
 **Secrets of Magic Elementalist**: This section updates and expands the elementalist class archetype originally presented on page 206 of _Secrets of Magic_. If you're using the version of the archetype from _Secrets of Magic_ and are happy with it, you don't need to make any changes—that original version functions the same as using the new text and choosing Inner Sea elementalism for your elemental philosophy!

### Elemental Magic (1st)

You're a spellcaster who specializes in harnessing the elements. Though you might feel a kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping many of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Elementalist Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.
 **Prerequisites**: You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the arcane or primal spell list.
 **Elementalist Adjustments**: Replace your spell list with the elemental spell list. Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead. You must choose an elemental philosophy (detailed below), which determines which spells and other elemental magic you can use.
 **Druid Elementalist Adjustments**: If you're a [[DATABASE/class_/Druid|druid]] of the [[DATABASE/druidicorder/Storm|storm order]] and air is in your elemental philosophy, you can choose to replace your starting order spell, [[DATABASE/spell/Tempest Surge|tempest surge]], with [[DATABASE/spell/Updraft|updraft]].
 **Elemental Sorcerer Adjustments**: If you're a [[DATABASE/class_/Sorcerer|sorcerer]] with the [[DATABASE/sorcererbloodline/Elemental|elemental bloodline]], you can replace your initial bloodline spell with an initial elemental focus spell, and your advanced bloodline spell with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline.
 **Wizard Elementalist Adjustments**: If you're a wizard, you can either choose to be a universalist or to follow an arcane school dedicated to one element from your elemental philosophy. If you choose an elemental school, your curriculum spells can be any spells that you have access to and that have your chosen element's trait. Your school spells are the elemental focus spells of your chosen element, with the 1st-rank spell as your initial school spell and the 3rd-rank spell as the advanced school spell.
**Elemental Focus Spells**

* **Air** initial: [[DATABASE/spell/Updraft|updraft]]; advanced: [[DATABASE/spell/Powerful Inhalation|powerful inhalation]] 
* **Earth** initial: [[DATABASE/spell/Crushing Ground|crushing ground]]; advanced: [[DATABASE/spell/Stone Lance|stone lance]] 
* **Fire** initial: [[DATABASE/spell/Wildfire|wildfire]]; advanced: [[DATABASE/spell/Combustion|combustion]] 
* **Metal** initial: [[DATABASE/spell/Serrate|serrate]]; advanced: [[DATABASE/spell/Repel Metal|repel metal]] 
* **Water** initial: [[DATABASE/spell/Rising Surf|rising surf]]; advanced: [[DATABASE/spell/Pulverizing Cascade|pulverizing cascade]] 
* **Wood** initial: [[DATABASE/spell/Arms of Nature|arms of nature]]; advanced: [[DATABASE/spell/Wood Walk|wood walk]]

### Elemental Philosophy

Choose an elemental philosophy, which determines which elements you can use. The options available in this book are as follows.

* **Elemental Cycle**: Earth, fire, metal, water, wood
* **Inner Sea Elementalism**: Air, earth, fire, water

Your choice of elemental philosophy affects your spell list, with the spell list for elemental cycle elementalists found here and the spell list for the inner sea elementalist found here. In addition to some universal spells that both philosophies have access to, your personal list also contains any spell that shares one or more traits with those in your elemental philosophy, and doesn't have any traits that aren't in your elemental philosophy. For example, an elemental cycle elementalist could choose a spell with both the earth and fire traits, but not one with the air and fire traits, while an inner sea elementalist could choose either of those, but not a spell with metal and fire traits.
As _Rage of Elements_ is the first book to include the wood and metal traits, your GM might allow you to add more spells from other books that fit the metal or wood element but first appeared without the trait, adding the relevant trait to the spell.
You can't take elementalist feats or use elementalist abilities for an element you're unable to attune to. For example, an Inner Sea elementalist couldn't select the [[DATABASE/feat/Reverberating Spell|Reverberating Spell]] feat, use [[DATABASE/feat/Redirect Elements|Redirect Elements]] against a metal or wood spell, or choose a metal or wood ability for their [[DATABASE/feat/Elemental Familiar|Elemental Familiar]].

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

The spell gains the water trait (causing it to deal extra damage to creatures with weakness to water).

Your familiar becomes an elemental spirit capable of taking on aspects of the elements. Other than taking the form of an elemental instead of an animal, this familiar continues to use all the same rules as other familiars. If you want to give your familiar the elemental familiar abilities found on page 42, you must select that familiar ability.
 Your familiar gains one additional familiar ability each day, which must be one of the following elemental familiar abilities. While your familiar has an elemental familiar ability, your familiar is composed of the associated elemental matter and gains the matching elemental trait. You can't select more than one elemental familiar ability at a time.

* **Air** If your familiar stays completely still for 1 round, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] until it next takes an action. Any motion, even being moved or carried by another creature, ends this effect.
* **Earth** Your familiar gains resistance to physical damage (except [[DATABASE/equipment/Adamantine Weapon|adamantine]]) equal to half your level.
* **Fire** Your familiar sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) and emits warmth. Creatures who remain within a 15-foot emanation don't take damage from severe environmental cold.
* **Metal** Your familiar gains resistance to physical damage from metal weapons equal to half your level.
* **Water** Your familiar can move through a gap at least 2 inches wide without [[DATABASE/action/Squeeze|Squeezing]] and can Squeeze through a gap at least 1 inch wide.
* **Wood** If your familiar remains in bright light for 1 round, it gains [[DATABASE/monsterability/Fast Healing|fast healing]] equal to half your level. Once it is out of bright light, this effect ends.
