# Assassin

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Targeted killing through stealth and subterfuge is the expertise of an assassin. While assassins are skilled in ending lives and many are evil, some live by a moral code, preying on the wicked, the cruel, or those who revel in unchecked aggression or power.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Assassin Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Assassin]]
**Prerequisites** [[Alchemical Crafting]]; trained in [[Crafting]], [[Deception]], and [[Stealth]]

---
You've trained to assassinate your foes, and you do so with tenacity and precision. You gain the Mark for Death activity.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">3</span> Mark for Death **Requirements** You can see and hear the creature you intend to mark; **Effect** You designate a single creature as your mark. This lasts until the mark dies or you use Mark for Death again. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Seek]] your mark and on [[Deception]] checks to [[Feint]] against your mark. Your agile and finesse weapons and unarmed attacks gain the backstabber and deadly d6 weapon traits when you're attacking your mark. If the weapon or unarmed attack already has the deadly trait, increase the size of the deadly damage die by one step instead of giving it deadly d6.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the assassin archetype.

## [[Angel of Vindication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
**Archetype** [[Assassin]]
**Prerequisites** [[Assassin Dedication]]
**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
**Requirements** Your mark is an undead creature.

---
To aid with your mission of destroying undead, you've specialized in techniques to destroy them, much as other assassins learn to kill the living. When you Strike a [[Flat-Footed]] undead foe with a weapon that has the backstabber weapon trait, you deal 3 extra precision damage instead of 1. If the weapon is a +3 weapon, you deal 6 extra precision damage instead of 2. If you have the [[Angel of Death]] feat, your attacks also instantly destroy undead at 0 Hit Points, and attempts for the undead to rejuvenate—such as via a [[Lich]] _soul cage_ or a [[Ghost]] rejuvenation ability—fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or deity. Finally, if you have the [[Assassinate]] feat and an undead mark critically fails its save against your Assassinate, it is destroyed.

## [[Eclipsed Vitality]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>

**Archetypes** [[Assassin]], [[Scout]]
**Prerequisites** [[Assassin Dedication]], or [[Scout Dedication]]; master in [[Stealth]]
**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

---
You shroud yourself in ashes that hide the vital essence sought by life-sensing undead. You're always taking precautions when [[Avoid Notice]], [[Hide]], and [[Sneak]] to foil [[Lifesense]], and you're [[Concealed]] to any creature using only precise lifesense to observe you.

## [[Expert Backstabber]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Assassin]]
**Prerequisites** [[Assassin Dedication]]

---
When you Strike a [[Flat-Footed]] foe with a weapon that has the backstabber weapon trait, you deal 2 extra precision damage instead of 1. If the weapon is a +3 weapon, you deal 4 extra precision damage instead of 2.

## [[Poison Resistance]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Alchemist</span><span class="item-trait">Druid</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Assassin]], [[Poisoner]]
* This version of the Poison Resistance feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Poison Resistance]].

---
Your body has become fortified against toxins. You gain poison resistance equal to half your level, and you gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against poisons.

## [[Surprise Attack]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Assassin]]
**Prerequisites** [[Assassin Dedication]]

---
You act before foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll [[Deception]] or [[Stealth]] for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are [[Flat-Footed]] to you.

## [[Poison Weapon]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Manipulate</span><span class="item-trait">Rogue</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Assassin]], [[Drow Shootist]], [[Poisoner]]
**Requirements** You are wielding a piercing or slashing weapon.
* This version of the Poison Weapon feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Poison Weapon]].

---
You apply a poison to the required weapon; if you have a free hand, you can Interact to draw a poison as part of this action. If your next attack with that weapon before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, it applies the effects of the poison, provided that poison can be delivered by contact or injury. If you critically fail the attack roll, the poison is wasted as normal.
**Special** During your daily preparations, you can prepare a number of simple injury poisons equal to your rogue level. These poisons deal 1d4 poison damage. Only you can apply these poisons properly, and they expire the next time you prepare.

## [[Sneak Attacker]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Assassin]], [[Rogue]]
**Prerequisites** [[Rogue Dedication]]
* This version of the Sneak Attacker feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Sneak Attacker]].

---
You gain the sneak attack class feature, except it deals 1d4 damage, increasing to 1d6 at 6th level. You don’t increase the number of dice as you gain levels.

## [[Public Execution]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Auditory</span><span class="item-trait">Flourish</span><span class="item-trait">Linguistic</span>
**Source** [[Firebrands]]
**Archetype** [[Assassin]]
**Prerequisites** [[Assassin Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Requirements** You have designated a mark using Mark for Death.

---

Some rebel Firebrand cells make a practice of publicly declaring the main target of a given operation. You announce your intention to kill your mark for all to hear and reveal the reason they must die, perhaps listing their crimes or sharing a damning secret. Creatures within 30 feet who can see and hear you are shocked by your proclamation or otherwise reluctant to come to your mark's aid. They must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the creature can't attack you or otherwise perform hostile actions against you until the end of your next turn. If you use a hostile action against a creature other than your mark, this effect ends. Your mark becomes temporarily immune to your Public Execution for 1 day.

## [[Angel of Death]] <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Assassin]]
**Prerequisites** [[Assassin Dedication]]

---
All your Strikes against a creature you have Marked for Death have the death trait, causing the mark to be instantly killed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. When killed in this way, attempts to communicate with it, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or a deity.

## [[Improved Poison Weapon]] <span class="item-type">Feat 10*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Rogue</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Assassin]], [[Poisoner]]
**Prerequisites** [[Poison Weapon]]
* This version of the Improved Poison Weapon feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Improved Poison Weapon]].

---
You deliver poisons in ways that maximize their harmful effects. When you apply a simple poison with Poison Weapon, the poison deals 2d4 poison damage instead of 1d4 poison damage. You don’t waste a poison you apply with Poison Weapon on a critically failed attack roll.

## [[Assassinate]] <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 12</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Assassin]]
**Prerequisites** [[Assassin Dedication]]
**Requirements** You have designated a mark using [[Assassin Dedication]] and are completely [[Unnoticed]] by your mark.

---
You strike with one swift movement, trying to instantly slay your mark. Make a Strike against your mark. If you hit, your mark takes 6d6 extra precision damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the mark critically fails, they die. This is an incapacitation effect. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your Assassinate for 1 day.
