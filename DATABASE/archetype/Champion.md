# Champion

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
You have sworn a solemn oath to your deity, who has granted you champion powers to aid you in your cause.

### Multiclass Champion characters

The champion archetype greatly improves defenses, particularly armor. It’s a great way for a character to gain armor proficiency or a powerful defensive reaction.
