**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You shove your way through legions of foes, knock enemies on all sides to the ground, and deal massive blows to anyone or anything that comes near.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Mauler|Mauler]]
**Prerequisites** Strength 14

---
You specialize in weapons that require two hands. You become trained in all simple and martial melee weapons that require two hands to wield or have the two-hand trait. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in these weapons. If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the mauler archetype.

**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Mauler|Mauler]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]]

---
You make an attack to knock a foe off balance, then follow up immediately with a sweep to topple them. Make a melee Strike. If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] the creature you hit. If you're wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you can ignore Trip's requirement that you have a hand free. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.

---
You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. If you’re at least 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re at least 18th level, increase it to three extra dice.

You put your body behind your massive weapon and swing, shoving enemies to clear a wide path. You attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] up to five creatures adjacent to you, rolling a separate [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check for each target. Then Stride up to half your Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions from any of the creatures you successfully Shoved.

**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Mauler|Mauler]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Knockdown|Knockdown]]
* This version of the Improved Knockdown feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[DATABASE/feat/Improved Knockdown|original feat]].

---
You can dash your foe to the ground with a single blow. When you use Knockdown, instead of making a Strike followed by a [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]], you can attempt a single Strike. If you do and your Strike hits, instead of rolling a check for your Trip attempt, you automatically apply the critical success effect of a Trip. If you used a two-handed melee weapon for the Strike, you can use the weapon's damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical Trip.

Your final blow can make an impact even if it rebounds off a foe’s defenses. Make a Strike with the required weapon. After the Strike, your turn ends. The Strike deals one extra weapon damage die, or two extra weapon damage dice if you’re at least 18th level. The Strike also gains the following failure effect.
**Failure** You deal damage equal to one weapon damage die of the required weapon. Increase this to two dice if you’re at least 18th level.

You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby creatures to the ground. Choose a square within your reach, including your own space. If there's a foe in the chosen square, Strike that foe with the required weapon. Then attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] every foe in the chosen square plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring Trip's requirement that you have a hand free. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made the Strike, if any, and all the Trip attempts.

Choose up to three adjacent foes and choose whether to [[DATABASE/action/Shove|Shove]] or [[DATABASE/action/Trip|Trip]] all three of them. Whichever of the two options you choose, roll a separate [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against each foe, performing the same action against each foe. Each attempt counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all the attempts.
