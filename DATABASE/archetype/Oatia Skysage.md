# Oatia Skysage

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 187. The Seventh Arch|Pathfinder #187: The Seventh Arch]]
The tradition of Oatia skysages stems from a small sect of dedicated stargazers on Castrovel. To better study the celestial mantle, these eccentric astronomers broke away from their Sovyrian kin and migrated to the wild continent of Ukulam, where the night skies were clear of light pollution. Though reclusive, Oatia skysages have been known to pass on their esoteric knowledge and unique worldview to similar-minded adventurers. Such adventuring skysages search for secrets and omens in the stars and can even call down stars' light to aid them in battle.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

Your study of the stars unlocks supernatural insights and magic. You either become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Astronomy Lore]] or an expert in Occultism.
 You learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the Cast a Spell activity. You gain a spell repertoire with two common cantrips of your choice; these cantrips can be from any spell tradition, but they must be divination spells. You cast these spells as occult spells as you draw on the stars and night sky. You're trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs. If you have a hand free and you've gazed at the night sky in the last 24 hours, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Intelligence.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Oatia skysage archetype.

The stars and moon lend you their light. You gain your choice of the [[DATABASE/spell/Moonbeam|moonbeam]] or [[DATABASE/spell/Zenith Star|zenith star]] domain spell.

**Requirements** You can see the night sky.

Portents written in the night sky show you how to avoid an attack. The triggering attack roll targets your [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn't remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with [[DATABASE/monsterability/Sneak Attack|sneak attack]] would still deal extra damage to you for being [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], even though you wouldn't take the –2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.

You armor yourself in the light of distant suns, shielding yourself from harm. The armor grants you resistance 7 to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage. The armor also sheds bright light for 20 feet (and dim light for the next 20 feet).
 Whenever an adjacent creature attacks you, the attacker must attempt a Will save against your spell DC at the end of its action. On a failure, it becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until the end of its next turn. Regardless of the result of the save, the attacker is temporarily immune until the end of its next turn. The dazzling effect has the light and visual traits.
 When you reach 17th level, the resistance increases to 10.

You gain master proficiency with spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.
