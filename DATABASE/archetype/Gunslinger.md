# Gunslinger

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
You like a weapon that makes an impression almost as much as you like making an impression.

### Multiclass Gunslinger Characters

Gunslinger is a great fit for dexterous characters who want a weapon that hits hard from a distance, especially [[DATABASE/class_/Ranger|rangers]] and [[DATABASE/class_/Rogue|rogues]] who already have abilities that can make their first hit count. Spellcasters with [[DATABASE/spell/True Strike|true strike]] might favor firearms with the fatal property and gunslinger abilities that improve options for supporting their allies.
