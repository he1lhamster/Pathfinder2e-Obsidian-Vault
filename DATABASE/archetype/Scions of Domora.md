# Scions of Domora

**Source** [[Pathfinder 188. They Watched the Stars]]
Centuries ago, Domora Hume founded a lakeside city that would become one of the largest in western Sarkoris. When the city was attacked by raiders, Hume conjured a guardian from the lake to drive back the attackers. In the process, he also become the region's first god caller in generations.
 Hume's summoned savior was an ancient spirit guide from the Plane of Water named Dyzad. With Dyzad's guidance, Domorans summoned more such spirit guides, all of which the citizens worshipped as gods long after his passing. This tradition of god calling—and the worship of Sarkorian gods—came to define the city of Domora.
 In the ensuing years, countless pilgrims, Sarkorian or otherwise, came to Domora to learn of god calling. Many hoped to summon a god to bring back to their own people, while others petitioned the deities as a means of spiritual growth. Today, the Domoran god calling tradition is all but extinguished—wiped out during the Worldwound incursion. Nonetheless, worthy individuals who brave Domora's ruins might unbury a small fragment of this tradition. Although they aren't true god callers—they lack the ability to bond with greater spirit guides or unlock the highest levels of their power—such “scions” still forge unique relationships with lesser spirit guides. Scions of Domora provide physical and spiritual anchors for their spirit guide companions, while the spirit guide returns the favor by sharing a portion of its supernatural powers.
