# Dragon Disciple

## Instinct of the Wyrm

The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.
 Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.
 Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display.

The rippling waves of fear, the rustling of thick scales, and the beat of immense wings signal the arrival of a great dragon. The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence—or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path.
 As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon, countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury. These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge.

You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your focus grants you a measure of its power. You become trained in arcane spell DCs and arcane spell attack rolls. Choose one color of dragon when you select this feat; if you are a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, this must be the same type as your bloodline. You gain resistance equal to half your level against one type of damage determined by the chosen dragon type. The GM may allow you to choose a dragon type not listed below, and will determine the damage type appropriate for that dragon.

You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against sleep effects and effects that would make you [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]].
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the dragon disciple archetype. If you later take the [[DATABASE/archetype/Sorcerer|sorcerer archetype]], you must choose the draconic bloodline.

You've discovered how to transform yourself into a cloud dragon. Once per day, you can cast 7th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Dragon Form|dragon form]] as an innate arcane spell, transforming into a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dragon, Cloud|cloud dragon]]. The spell automatically heightens to 8th level if you're 16th level and 9th level if you're 18th level. On a critical hit with an unarmed Strike gained from _dragon form_, you recharge the spell's breath weapon immediately.
 While in this form, you gain the following cloud dragon–specific abilities:

* **Cloud** cloud walk (you can walk on clouds or fog); **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws, **Damage** 2d10 piercing plus 1d12 electricity; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw (agile), **Damage** 3d10 slashing; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> tail (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d10 bludgeoning; **Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> horn (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d8 piercing; breath weapon 30-foot cone, 6d12 electricity.

You've mastered a defensive technique unique to the ancient dragons of Bloodsalt: beating your wings to create a billowing cloud of mist.
