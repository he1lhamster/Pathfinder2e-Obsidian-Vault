# Bullet Dancer

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
While most monastic orders and traditional fighting schools shun firearms as loud and unreliable technology for unskilled conscripts, you fuse flourishing feints and ricocheting gunplay into a whirling ballet of bullets. As a bullet dancer, you might become the target of brash duelists and gladiators looking to make a name for themselves. But you tend to welcome the attention and might have proven your reputation while dancing your deadly ballet in tournaments from Tymon to Goka. You've found your fluid motions and explosive attacks to be surefire crowd-pleasers, even as they serve to confound and shock your foes.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

You've learned how to synchronize traditional martial arts and guns. You gain the Bullet Dancer Stance action. Whenever your proficiency in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you gain that new proficiency with bayonets, reinforced stocks, simple firearms and unarmed attacks.
 **Bullet Dancer Stance** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (stance) **Requirements** You're unarmored and wielding a simple [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Firearm|firearm]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Bayonet|bayonet]], or [[DATABASE/weapon/Reinforced Stock|reinforced stock]]; **Effect** You enter a specialized stance for a unique martial art centered around the use of simple firearms. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are those using bayonets, reinforced stocks, and simple firearms. You can use [[DATABASE/action/Flurry of Blows|Flurry of Blows]] with these weapons. You can use your other monk feats or [[DATABASE/class_/Monk|monk abilities]] that normally require unarmed attacks with bayonets and reinforced stocks, so long as the feat or ability doesn't require a single, specific Strike. You can also use them with simple firearms when attacking within half the first range increment.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the bullet dancer dedication archetype.

You know how to make the most of your attacks when fighting hand-to-hand. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of unarmed strikes in the brawling group and weapons in the brawling group. If you have [[DATABASE/feat/Monastic Weaponry|Monastic Weaponry]], you also gain the critical specialization effects of all monk weapons in which you are trained.

Your quick gestures and flair for performance distract your opponent, leaving it vulnerable to your follow-up attacks. You [[DATABASE/action/Feint|Feint]] against an opponent within the required weapon's first range increment, rather than an opponent within melee reach. If you succeed, the foe is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against your melee and ranged attacks, rather than only your melee attacks. On a critical failure, you're flat-footed against the target's melee and ranged attacks, rather than only its melee attacks.

If you spend 2 actions for Black Powder Boost, you [[DATABASE/action/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[DATABASE/action/Long Jump|Long Jump]] instead.
**Special** An ability that allows you to High Jump or Long Jump as a single action (like the [[DATABASE/feat/Quick Jump|Quick Jump]] skill feat) lets you use Black Powder Boost as a single action for those jumps as well.

## [[DATABASE/feat/Bullet Dancer Burn|Bullet Dancer Burn]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Bullet Dancer Dedication|Bullet Dancer Dedication]]
**Requirements** You're wielding a firearm with an attached bayonet or reinforced stock.

---
The fiery blaze of your weapons combined with your unorthodox technique leaves your opponents with little opportunity to capitalize on any gaps in your defenses, or properly defend themselves against your onslaught. While in [[DATABASE/feat/Bullet Dancer Dedication|Bullet Dancer Stance]], when you successfully Strike an opponent with a [[DATABASE/weapon/Bayonet|bayonet]] or [[DATABASE/weapon/Reinforced Stock|reinforced stock]] attached to your firearm, the next ranged Strike you make against that opponent doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack, such as [[DATABASE/action/Attack of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]]. While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you make a successful ranged Strike against an opponent within your melee reach using a firearm, the next reinforced stock or bayonet attack attached to that firearm deals an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die.
 The benefit on your next Strike from either use of Bullet Dancer Burn is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.

You’ve learned to react with ranged weapons when a creature is in close quarters. You can use a reaction that normally allows you to make a melee weapon Strike to instead make a ranged weapon Strike. You must be Striking an adjacent target. If necessary for the reaction’s trigger, you treat your ranged weapon as if it had a reach of 5 feet. If the reaction has other requirements, such as wielding a specific kind of weapon, Snap Shot doesn’t allow you to ignore them; it allows you only to replace a melee weapon Strike with a ranged weapon Strike.

You've learned to reload your simple firearms with uncanny grace, the ammunition simply falling into place as though part of a well-practiced kata.

You shoot not at your foe but at an object nearby. Make a Strike with your firearm against an AC equal to an easy DC for your level. On a success, instead of hitting your foe, your attack hits an object behind or to the side of your target, creating one of the following effects. The GM might determine that a different AC is appropriate or that a particular effect isn't a valid option, such as using the explosive barrel option when there's no such object on the battlefield. The GM should inform you if a Trick Shot is feasible before you spend your actions, since your trained eye can easily recognize loose or volatile objects.

* **Dislodge Object** Your attack knocks an unattended object of no more than 2 Bulk out of position, moving it up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. For example, the weapon could knock a wizard's crystal ball off a table.
* **Explosive Barrel** Your attack strikes a barrel of expensive rum, a vial of volatile alchemical fluids, a demonic pustule erupting from the earth, or some other explosive object. The object explodes in a 20-foot burst, and creatures in the area take 6d6 damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The damage type is chosen by the GM, based on the exploding object. Increase the damage by 1d6 for every 2 levels you have above 10th.

When using a simple firearm, you can shoot objects right out of your enemy's hands. Attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Disarm|Disarm]] the target using a ranged attack roll with your simple firearm, instead of attempting an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the target's Reflex DC.

You bounce your shot off a nearby surface to strike your opponent from an unexpected angle.

You roll one [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] check and compare it against each target's Perception DC.
