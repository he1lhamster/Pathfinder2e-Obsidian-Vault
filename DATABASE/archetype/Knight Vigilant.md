# Knight Vigilant

**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
Taking their lead from heroic stories of the Shining Crusade, the knights vigilant stand as a courageous example of morality and honor.

### Knights of Lastwall Archetypes

The following archetypes are uncommon but are available to members of the Knights of Lastwall. Qualifying characters with the [[Lastwall Sentry]] archetype can select one of these dedications even without gaining three feats from the Lastwall sentry archetype, and each of these archetypes’ feats fulfills the [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]] special requirement despite not being from the Lastwall sentry archetype.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

 You gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point or increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [[Refocus]] activity to pray to your deity or perform service toward their causes. The full rules for focus spells are here. You are trained in divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma.

**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]

## [[Shield Warden]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Champion</span><span class="item-trait">Fighter</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetypes** [[Bastion]], [[Knight Vigilant]]
**Prerequisites** [Champion] [[Champion]]; [Champion] [[Good]]; [Fighter] [[Shield Block]]
* This version of the Shield Warden feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Shield Warden]].

---
You use your shield to protect your allies. When you have a shield raised, you can use your [[Shield Block]] reaction when an attack is made against an ally adjacent to you. If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of preventing you from taking damage, following the normal rules for Shield Block.

## [[Unshakable Idealism]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Knight Vigilant]]
**Prerequisites** [[Knight Vigilant]]; expert in Will saves

---
Your faith and hope can’t be shaken, and you won’t flee when lives are at stake. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against fear effects and emotion effects that inflict despair. When you would gain the [[Fleeing]] condition, you can choose to stand your ground and be [[Stunned]] for the effect’s duration as well, preventing you from running and allowing you to re-enter the fight more quickly when the effect ends.

## [[Emissary of Peace]] <span class="action-icon">3</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>
**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
**Archetype** [[Knight Vigilant]]
**Prerequisites** [[Knight Vigilant]]; master in [[Diplomacy]]

---
Even when bloodshed is inevitable, you would rather see your foes surrender. You attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Make an Impression]] against a single foe whose Hit Points are at less than half of their maximum value, followed by an immediate [[Request]] to convince that creature to cease fighting. You take a –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the DC of the Request based on the circumstances; it's generally at least a very hard DC for the creature's level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and those who agree to parley might find your arguments lacking and start fighting again.

## [[Endure Death's Touch]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Knight Vigilant]]
**Prerequisites** [[Knight Vigilant]]; expert in medium or heavy armor
**Trigger** An undead hits you with an unarmed attack.
**Requirements** You are wearing medium or heavy armor in which you have expert proficiency.

---
Your conviction redirects the undead’s attack through your armor and then harmlessly away. You gain resistance 5 to physical damage and resistance 10 to negative damage against the triggering attack. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against effects from the undead’s natural attack; if you succeed at the saving throw, you get a critical success instead.

## [[Instant Armor]] <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
**Archetype** [[Knight Vigilant]]
**Prerequisites** [[Knight Vigilant]]

---
A knight is nothing without their armor, and you know how to keep yours ready. You can perform a 10-minute ritual, which has the conjuration and magical traits, to divert a set of heavy armor you are wearing into an extradimensional space connected to you. While the armor is in this space, you can use a three-action activity, which has the concentrate, conjuration, and teleportation traits, to phase the armor back and instantly don it. The armor automatically phases away if you don another set of armor, if you become [[Unconscious]], or if you die. If you are incapable of wearing the armor when it phases back, it appears in your square instead.

## [[Lead the Way]] <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
**Archetype** [[Knight Vigilant]]
**Prerequisites** [[Knight Vigilant]]

---
You move forward, creating an opening for others to follow. Choose one adjacent ally who has a reaction available. You Stride, and that ally can use their reaction to immediately Stride. The ally must end their Stride adjacent to you. If the ally Strides in this way, they don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement. You, however, still trigger those reactions normally.

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>

**Archetypes** [[Cavalier]], [[Knight Vigilant]]
**Prerequisites** [[Cavalier's Banner]]; [[Knight Vigilant]]
**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

---
Your banner makes it harder for your foes to push your allies around and encourages your allies to protect the innocent. Allies benefiting from your Cavalier's Banner feat also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to [[Disarm]], [[Grapple]], [[Shove]], and [[Trip]]. Each benefited ally also gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls against any creature that has dealt damage to an innocent of a lower level than that ally within the last round; summoned creatures, companions, or any creatures you or your allies put into danger on purpose to attempt to gain this bonus don't count.

As part of daily preparation, you can drill with a number of allies up to your Charisma modifier. These allies must be present and listening during this time, but this does not otherwise impede their own preparation. When you use this feat's benefit, you and all drilled companions within 30 feet who are wielding shields [[Raise a Shield]]. Allies who Raise their Shields keep them raised until the start of their next turn, as normal.

## [[Mirror Shield]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 12*</span>

---
You reflect the spell back against the triggering opponent. Make a ranged attack against the triggering creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. If you can cast spells, you can make a spell attack roll instead. If you succeed, your opponent takes the effects of a successful spell attack roll for their own spell (or the effects of a critical success if your attack roll was a critical success).

## [[Vigilant Benediction]] <span class="item-type">Feat 12</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
**Archetype** [[Knight Vigilant]]
**Prerequisites** [[Knight Vigilant]]; alignment permitted by the chosen deity

---
Unwilling to be outdone by the Crimson Reclaimers and their oath, you've petitioned the gods of good for a sliver of divine magic. Choose one of the following deities whose requirements you meet—for the Any Deity option below, you can select from the following deities or a deity the GM deems appropriate: [[Arazni]], [[Arqueros]], [[Falayna]], [[Gendowyn]], [[Iomedae]], [[Kazutal]], [[Kols]], [[Milani]], [[Pharasma]], [[Ragathiel]], [[Sarenrae]], [[Shelyn]], [[Suyuddha]], [[Vildeis]]—and one of the listed spells. You can Cast that Spell once per day as a 4th-level divine innate spell, and you become trained in divine spell DCs and divine spell attack rolls. At 14th level, the spell heightens to 5th level; at 16th level, the spell heightens to 6th level. Once you've selected a deity and a spell, you can't change this selection. You don't need to worship the deity as your patron deity, as they are willing to grant this boon on behalf of your worthy cause. You must refrain from performing your deity's anathema or lose the ability to cast this spell until you atone.

* **Any Deity**: [[Freedom of Movement]], [[Remove Curse]], [[Resist Energy]], [[Spell Immunity]], [[Status]]

You can select this feat a third time at 18th level. If you do, you gain a third spell to cast once per day from your chosen deity's list or the Any Deity list, and all three spells are heightened to 7th level.
