# Pathfinder Agent

**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Pathfinder Agent|Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** member of the Pathfinder Society
**Access** You are from Absalom.

---
Your Pathfinder training has broadened your horizons and made you more flexible at various skills, since you never know when you might need an obscure skill to complete your mission. You become trained in one skill of your choice, or expert in a skill of your choice in which you were trained. You also become trained in Pathfinder [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]], or an expert if you were already trained. When using a skill untrained, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level instead of 0. You gain access to [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinders]].
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Pathfinder Agent archetype.

You’ve explored enough dusty tombs and hidden vaults to gain a sixth sense about traps, and you sometimes notice them even when you’re not trying to. Even if you aren’t Searching in exploration mode, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.

When you set things up to help your allies, you also gain some of the fruits of your labors. When you successfully [[DATABASE/action/Aid|Aid]] an attack roll or AC, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls or AC against that enemy until the end of your next turn, whichever you granted to your ally. When you successfully Aid a skill check, if you attempt the exact same skill check (not just using the same skill, but using it for the same purpose, for instance a check to Climb the same wall) on your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill check.

You've traversed enough untamed wilderness to gain an intuitive understanding of the dangers that exist in such places. Your extensive familiarity means you sometimes notice perils even when you're not trying to. Even if you aren't [[DATABASE/action/Search|Searching]] in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find environmental hazards that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find a particular hazard.

---
Thanks to the time you've spent wandering through wild and untamed environments, you've gained an intuitive sense about creatures. You sometimes notice them before they attack, or spot them nearby even if they weren't planning on attacking. You can attempt a check to notice [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] creatures attempting to [[DATABASE/action/Avoid Notice|Avoid Notice]] nearby even if you aren't actively [[DATABASE/action/Search|Searching]] for them.

---
During your training to become a Pathfinder Agent you were schooled on a wide variety of creatures you might encounter, and you can think back to that training to gain crucial insight in times of need. Attempt a check to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about a creature you can see, adding your level as a proficiency bonus if you are untrained (rather than 0). If you roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on this check, you get a success instead.

You're familiar with the danger that lingering spirits can pose to an unwary adventurer, and you're particularly attuned to their presence. Even if you aren't [[DATABASE/action/Search|Searching]] in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find haunts that normally require you to Search for them.

Your reports are thorough and informative, and putting your thoughts to paper helps you retain the information. Keep track of each type of creature you successfully identify with Recall Knowledge. When attempting Recall Knowledge checks against creatures on your list in later encounters, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and you learn an additional fact about such creatures on a success.

**Trigger** An ally you can see succeeds or critically succeeds at a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, using a skill in which you are untrained.

---
Pathfinder agents serve as members of diverse teams with complementary skill sets. You are practiced at following the example of a more skilled ally to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. For the next minute you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to the observed skill check, even though you are untrained. This does not allow you to attempt trained actions using that skill unless you would otherwise be able to do so.

You can use the unusual resonance of your [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]] to grant it additional effects. Choose one cantrip from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal list. You can activate your [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]] to cast that cantrip at will. As normal, this cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. Additionally, you can Activate your [[DATABASE/equipment/Wayfinder|wayfinder]] with a <span class="action-icon">1</span> (envision) activation to transform it into a nondescript pin or brooch to hide your affiliation with the Pathfinder Society. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.

You're renowned for your ability to recover important items, whether they're from a long-abandoned temple or a thieves' den, and sometimes that requires creating a stand-in. You can spend 1 minute to assemble a facsimile of an object of no more than 1 Bulk that you can see from available materials. The facsimile has the same shape and Bulk as the replaced object and can pass as the object if not examined. A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else.

If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using [[DATABASE/feat/Thorough Reports|Thorough Reports]], you also deal 1 point of [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.<span>Swords Training</span>**Source** [[DATABASE/source/PFS Guide|PFS Guide]]
Marcos Farabellus (_Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide_ page 50) is a talented swordsman and likely the most beloved of the Society's three deans. In addition to teaching his students about the dangers of exploring ruins through energetic and performative lectures, Farabellus also teaches his favorite students a few of the martial techniques he's developed over his illustrious career. The Farabellus Flip is a class feat for barbarians, fighters, or rangers. When you select the feat, it loses the traits from the other classes.

You can cast this spell from the _wayfinder_ using the normal actions required. Once the spell has been cast, it is expended, and you must make your next daily preparations to store another spell in your _wayfinder_.<span>Spells Training</span>**Source** [[DATABASE/source/PFS Guide|PFS Guide]]
Sorrina Westyr (_Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide_ page 46) took up the mantle of dean of the school of Spells to replace her predecessor Aram Zey, who had originally been her replacement. When Aram Zey was lost to the magic of the extradimensional demiplane known as the Hao Jin Tapestry, Sorrina began teaching an advanced studies course in extradimensional and interplanar phenomena, hoping to both prevent future losses and better prepare her students for the unexpected challenges that may await them in their careers as Pathfinder agents.

Pathfinders are often asked to study the intricacies of ancient history under less than ideal conditions, and you've trained your brain to make the most of your limited time. You quickly memorize an inscription, scroll, or other piece of writing you can clearly see whose length is equivalent to no more than one page. You can then accurately recreate this writing using a [[DATABASE/equipment/Writing Set|writing kit]], wax tablet, or other writing medium, once you have reached safety. You don't need to understand the writing or identify the language to reproduce it. Your memory lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations; if you have not written down or otherwise recreated what you saw by this point, your memory fades and any attempt to recreate what you saw is garbled and unintelligible. You can have only one piece of writing memorized at a time; any previous memorization fades the next time you use this ability.
