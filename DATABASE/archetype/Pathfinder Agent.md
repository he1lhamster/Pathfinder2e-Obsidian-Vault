# Pathfinder Agent

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
You’re a field agent of the globe-trotting Pathfinder Society, sworn to report, explore, and cooperate. You explore the world, gathering artifacts and antiquities, and record your adventures for posterity.

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** member of the Pathfinder Society
**Access** You are from Absalom.

---
Your Pathfinder training has broadened your horizons and made you more flexible at various skills, since you never know when you might need an obscure skill to complete your mission. You become trained in one skill of your choice, or expert in a skill of your choice in which you were trained. You also become trained in Pathfinder [[Lore]], or an expert if you were already trained. When using a skill untrained, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level instead of 0. You gain access to [[Wayfinder]].
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Pathfinder Agent archetype.

You’ve explored enough dusty tombs and hidden vaults to gain a sixth sense about traps, and you sometimes notice them even when you’re not trying to. Even if you aren’t Searching in exploration mode, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.

You've trained yourself to maintain a strong sense of direction at all times, even when you can't use a [[Compass]] or see the sky above. You immediately intuit which direction is north (assuming the concept of north exists at your current location).

When you set things up to help your allies, you also gain some of the fruits of your labors. When you successfully [[Aid]] an attack roll or AC, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls or AC against that enemy until the end of your next turn, whichever you granted to your ally. When you successfully Aid a skill check, if you attempt the exact same skill check (not just using the same skill, but using it for the same purpose, for instance a check to Climb the same wall) on your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill check.

You've traversed enough untamed wilderness to gain an intuitive understanding of the dangers that exist in such places. Your extensive familiarity means you sometimes notice perils even when you're not trying to. Even if you aren't [[Search]] in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find environmental hazards that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find a particular hazard.

---
Thanks to the time you've spent wandering through wild and untamed environments, you've gained an intuitive sense about creatures. You sometimes notice them before they attack, or spot them nearby even if they weren't planning on attacking. You can attempt a check to notice [[Hidden]] creatures attempting to [[Avoid Notice]] nearby even if you aren't actively [[Search]] for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to notice a particular creature.

## [[Remember Your Training]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>

**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Frequency** once per day
**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]

---
During your training to become a Pathfinder Agent you were schooled on a wide variety of creatures you might encounter, and you can think back to that training to gain crucial insight in times of need. Attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] about a creature you can see, adding your level as a proficiency bonus if you are untrained (rather than 0). If you roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on this check, you get a success instead.

You're familiar with the danger that lingering spirits can pose to an unwary adventurer, and you're particularly attuned to their presence. Even if you aren't [[Search]] in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find haunts that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find a particular haunt.

## [[Thorough Reports]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]

---
Your reports are thorough and informative, and putting your thoughts to paper helps you retain the information. Keep track of each type of creature you successfully identify with Recall Knowledge. When attempting Recall Knowledge checks against creatures on your list in later encounters, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and you learn an additional fact about such creatures on a success.

## [[Watch and Learn]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]
**Trigger** An ally you can see succeeds or critically succeeds at a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, using a skill in which you are untrained.

---
Pathfinder agents serve as members of diverse teams with complementary skill sets. You are practiced at following the example of a more skilled ally to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. For the next minute you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to the observed skill check, even though you are untrained. This does not allow you to attempt trained actions using that skill unless you would otherwise be able to do so.

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>

**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]

---
You can use the unusual resonance of your [[Wayfinder]] to grant it additional effects. Choose one cantrip from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal list. You can activate your [[Wayfinder]] to cast that cantrip at will. As normal, this cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. Additionally, you can Activate your [[Wayfinder]] with a <span class="action-icon">1</span> (envision) activation to transform it into a nondescript pin or brooch to hide your affiliation with the Pathfinder Society. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.

## [[Archaeologist's Warning]] <span class="action-icon">4</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]
**Trigger** You are about to roll a Perception, [[Society]], or [[Thievery]] check for initiative.

---
You visually or audibly warn your companions of danger, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls. Depending on whether you use gestures or call out, this free action gains either the visual or auditory trait.

## [[Craft Facsimile]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>

**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** expert in [[Crafting]]; [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]

---
You're renowned for your ability to recover important items, whether they're from a long-abandoned temple or a thieves' den, and sometimes that requires creating a stand-in. You can spend 1 minute to assemble a facsimile of an object of no more than 1 Bulk that you can see from available materials. The facsimile has the same shape and Bulk as the replaced object and can pass as the object if not examined. A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else.

## [[Discerning Strike]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]; [[Thorough Reports]]
**Requirements** You have successfully identified the target with [[Recall Knowledge]] during this combat.

---
Identifying a creature is the first step in finding its weaknesses. Attempt a Strike against the target; if successful, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage. If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using [[Thorough Reports]], you also deal 1 point of [[Persistent Damage]]. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.<span>Swords Training</span>**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
Marcos Farabellus (_Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide_ page 50) is a talented swordsman and likely the most beloved of the Society's three deans. In addition to teaching his students about the dangers of exploring ruins through energetic and performative lectures, Farabellus also teaches his favorite students a few of the martial techniques he's developed over his illustrious career. The Farabellus Flip is a class feat for barbarians, fighters, or rangers. When you select the feat, it loses the traits from the other classes.

**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]; [[Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer]]
**Requirements** You have at least one 1st-level spell slot and a [[Wayfinder]].

---
You can use your _wayfinder_ to store a little extra magic for when you need it most. When making your daily preparations, you can choose one 1st-level spell from your spellbook or spell repertoire and store it in your _wayfinder_. You can cast this spell from the _wayfinder_ using the normal actions required. Once the spell has been cast, it is expended, and you must make your next daily preparations to store another spell in your _wayfinder_.<span>Spells Training</span>**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
Sorrina Westyr (_Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide_ page 46) took up the mantle of dean of the school of Spells to replace her predecessor Aram Zey, who had originally been her replacement. When Aram Zey was lost to the magic of the extradimensional demiplane known as the Hao Jin Tapestry, Sorrina began teaching an advanced studies course in extradimensional and interplanar phenomena, hoping to both prevent future losses and better prepare her students for the unexpected challenges that may await them in their careers as Pathfinder agents.

**Prerequisites** master in [[Medicine]]; [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]

---
Pathfinders are trained to help each other be safe and successful, and you know how to jolt your allies back to their senses. Attempt a [[Medicine]] check on an adjacent ally who is [[Fascinated]], [[Frightened]], [[Stunned]], or [[Stupefied]] and choose one of those conditions. The DC is the DC for the effect that caused the condition.
**Critical Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 2. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.
**Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.
**Failure** The target is unaffected.
**Critical Failure** You increase the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, increase the duration by 1 round instead.

**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]; [[Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer]]

---
You are adept at using the unusual resonance of your [[Wayfinder]] to aid in any deceptions you might employ. Once per day you can activate your _wayfinder_ to cast [[Illusory Disguise]], heightened to 2nd level, as an arcane spell. Additionally, once per day, you can Activate your _wayfinder_ with a single-action envision activation to transform it into a perfect replica of another similarly sized badge of membership or office, such as an Aspis Consortium badge.

**Archetype** [[Pathfinder Agent]]
**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]

---
Pathfinders are often asked to study the intricacies of ancient history under less than ideal conditions, and you've trained your brain to make the most of your limited time. You quickly memorize an inscription, scroll, or other piece of writing you can clearly see whose length is equivalent to no more than one page. You can then accurately recreate this writing using a [[Writing Set]], wax tablet, or other writing medium, once you have reached safety. You don't need to understand the writing or identify the language to reproduce it. Your memory lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations; if you have not written down or otherwise recreated what you saw by this point, your memory fades and any attempt to recreate what you saw is garbled and unintelligible. You can have only one piece of writing memorized at a time; any previous memorization fades the next time you use this ability.

**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]
**Access** A character who is a member of the Pathfinder Society has access to this option.
**Trigger** You fail, but don’t critically fail, an attempt to [[Disable a Device]] on a trap.

---
You intentionally set off the trap, but you take special precautions to protect yourself and your allies from the trap’s effects. For the next 2 rounds, if the trap rolls a critical success on an attack roll, it gets a normal success instead, and if anyone rolls a critical failure on their saving throw against the trap, they get a normal failure instead.

**Prerequisites** [[Pathfinder Agent Dedication]]
**Access** A character who is a member of the Pathfinder Society has access to this option.

---
You attempt to [[Recall Knowledge]] about a creature, and the GM uses the same secret roll result against the creature’s [[Retributive Strike]] or [[Bear Hug]] DC, giving you the information from a [[Battle Assessment]]. You might get a different degree of success on the Recall Knowledge check than what you get for the Battle Assessment. If you have the Battle Assessment feat, you gain the effects of Educated Assessment whenever you Recall Knowledge (such as with the [[Automatic Knowledge]] feat).

Your time as a Pathfinder has taught you how to improvise, and you've learned to make use of the resources you find in the field. You Invest a magic item and remove a previously invested item. The previous item no longer counts against your limit of 10 invested items.
