# Bounty Hunter

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Whether for coin, glory, or justice, you know how to track, defeat, and capture dangerous individuals. You're accustomed to perusing wanted posters, searching up on leads, and pursuing villains to hell and back.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

When focused on finding your quarry, you're relentless. You gain the [[DATABASE/action/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] action. You can use Hunt Prey to designate only a creature that you've seen, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [[DATABASE/action/Gather Information|Gather Information]] regarding your prey.
 If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] and gain the circumstance bonus to Gather Information about your prey; you can still designate a creature you're tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bounty hunter archetype.

By spending 1 minute giving guidance to help hunt down your prey, you instruct up to five willing creatures to assist you. They gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] your prey, to [[DATABASE/action/Track|Track]] your prey, and to [[DATABASE/action/Gather Information|Gather Information]] about your prey. You and the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey.
 This benefit lasts until you designate a new prey or your prey dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature assisting you loses this benefit if they're out of your presence for too long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1 hour, but is determined by the GM.
