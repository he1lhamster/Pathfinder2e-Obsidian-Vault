You can manifest the power of your spirit in combat to realize your motivations. You manifest an armor, shield, or weapon as a soulforged armament. Choose one essence power for the armament (below). Changing an essence power requires 1 week of retraining, and you can't retrain it while you have soulforged corruption.
 You can Manifest Soulforged Armament to summon your armaments in combat.
 **Manifest Soulforged Armament** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (concentrate, conjuration, divine, extradimensional) **Requirements** If summoning a weapon or shield, you have the hands free to wield it; if summoning armor, you aren't wearing any armor; **Effect** You immediately wield or wear the soulforged armament bound to you. The soulforged armament remains manifested until you Dismiss this effect.
 Once per day when you use this ability, you can manifest the armament's essence form. You gain the armament's essence power until it's Dismissed. After 1 minute, the essence form armament is automatically Dismissed.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat before gaining two other feats from this archetype.

You strive to change the outcome with sheer zeal. You gain a +1 status bonus to your attack roll if making an attack or to your AC if you were hit. This can change the outcome of the roll. If this bonus turns your missed attack into a hit or the hit against you into a miss, attempt a DC 5 flat check. If you fail, your soulforged armament is Dismissed—your weapon if you attacked or your armor or shield if you were defending.

Choose an additional soulforged armament of a different type than the type you already chose, and choose one essence power for it. Upgrade and change armaments individually.
 When you [[DATABASE/feat/Soulforger Dedication|Manifest Soulforged Armament]], you can summon any number of your armaments (you must meet the Requirements for each), and when you Dismiss the effect, you can choose to Dismiss some and not others. You can choose to manifest the essence form of any number of your armaments when you take the action. Each armament can manifest its essence form only once per day.
 When you gain soulforged corruption, choose one armament's corruption flaw to affect you for stage 1. At stage 2, you take the flaws of all your soulforged armaments. While you have the curse, each armament gets a separate flat check to manifest its essence form, and failing prevents you from manifesting only that armament's essence form.
**Special** You can select this feat a second time at 12th level or higher, choosing the final item type.

# Essence Powers

Your soulforged armament has an essence power you choose when you first bind it. It gains the power temporarily when you manifest its essence form. Each power has a corruption flaw that affects you if you have _soulforged corruption_. Essence powers that only apply to some types of armament indicate which.

_**Corruption Flaw**_ Whenever you take a status penalty from the listed conditions, you also take a –1 penalty to the same statistics.

_**Corruption Flaw**_ When you take damage while [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raising a Shield]] or use Shield Block, attempt a DC 5 flat check. If you fail, the shield is Dismissed if it's your soulforged armament or Dropped if it's a different shield.
