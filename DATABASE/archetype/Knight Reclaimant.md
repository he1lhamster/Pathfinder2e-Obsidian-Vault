# Knight Reclaimant

## The Crimson Oath

_We swear with voices cold as death,
 While yet we stand and yet draw breath,
 We shall not let the dead endure,
 Nor let them taint our lands verdure,
 We shall not falter, shall not rout,
 But cut them down and burn them out,
 We swear on Vigil's shattered walls,
 Our Crimson Oath: The Tyrant falls!_

**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
Knights reclaimant spend much of their time amid the horrors of the Gravelands, rescuing civilians that remain and striking back against the Whispering Tyrant’s agents. Accomplishing these goals requires the adoption of subtle tactics, with a focus on stealth and survival.

### Knights of Lastwall Archetypes

The following archetypes are uncommon but are available to members of the Knights of Lastwall. Qualifying characters with the [[Lastwall Sentry]] archetype can select one of these dedications even without gaining three feats from the Lastwall sentry archetype, and each of these archetypes’ feats fulfills the [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]] special requirement despite not being from the Lastwall sentry archetype.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

**Archetype** [[Knight Reclaimant]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Stealth]] and [[Survival]]; any non-evil alignment; member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank
**Access** A character who is a member of the Knights of Lastwall has access to this option.

---
You have sworn the Crimson Oath and become a full member of the Crimson Reclaimers. You gain expert proficiency in Stealth and Survival. Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an undead’s special ability, you get a critical success instead. This applies to any abilities that come from being undead, including an undead’s innate spells (but not its prepared or spontaneous spells).
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Knight Reclaimant archetype.

**Prerequisites** [[Knight Reclaimant Dedication]]; expert in [[Religion]] and master in [[Stealth]]

---
By smearing ash or tainted earth over your skin and armor, you shroud yourself from the dead. You become concealed to undead using vision or [[Lifesense]], allowing you to [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]] without other sources of cover or concealment. This effect lasts only as long as you continue to take no actions other than to Hide, Sneak, or other surreptitious actions. The GM determines which actions end the effect, but attacking, casting spells, activating items, and the like always do.

**Archetype** [[Knight Reclaimant]]
**Prerequisites** [[Knight Reclaimant Dedication]]; master in [[Intimidation]]
**Requirements** You are not [[Fatigued]].

---
Channeling the energy of the Crimson Oath into your voice, you pronounce a threat in a tone so icy it freezes the blood. Attempt an Intimidation check to [[Demoralize]]; you don't suffer a penalty if the target doesn't understand the language you're speaking, but this otherwise functions as normal. You can't use [[Intimidating Glare]] or any other effect that would cause your Demoralize attempt to lose the auditory trait as part of using this feat. If you critically succeed at your Intimidation check, the target becomes [[Stunned]], or stunned 2 if the target is undead. After using this feat, you are fatigued until the end of your next turn, and you can't use this feat again until the end of your next turn.

You call on the power of the Crimson Oath to gain magical aid. Choose one of the following spells: [[Air Walk]], [[Dimensional Anchor]], [[Freedom of Movement]], [[Invisibility]], [[Remove Curse]], [[Searing Light]]. You can Cast that Spell once per day as a 4th-level divine innate spell. At 14th level, the spell heightens to 5th level, and at 16th level, the spell heightens to 6th level. If you anger the mysterious source of the Crimson Oath's power, you lose the ability to cast the spell until you atone.
**Special** You can select this feat a second time at 14th level, gaining a second spell from the list above, [[Death Ward]], or [[Flame Strike]], which you can cast once per day; you also become an expert in divine spell DCs and divine spell attack rolls.

**Prerequisites** [[Knight Reclaimant Dedication]]; [[Invoke the Crimson Oath]]

You've reached the apex of the Crimson Oath's power. The oath's power is overwhelming—too much for a mortal frame—but victory is worth any price. When you use this feat, you cry out the final line of the Crimson Oath, unleashing unbridled power for 1 minute. You can Dismiss this effect. While this effect is active, you gain the following effects:

* At the beginning of each of your turns, you become drained 1 or increase the value of your drained condition by 1 if you are already drained. You can't reduce the value of your drained condition or remove it while The Tyrant Falls! is active. While The Tyrant Falls! is active, your drained condition does not penalize your Fortitude save.
* You can cast [[Invoke the Crimson Oath]] at will without expending Focus Points. When you do, increase the area to a 40-foot cone.
* You gain resistance to all damage equal to half your character level.
* Any melee weapon you wield gains the reach trait if it didn't already possess it, or increases its reach by 5 feet if it already has the reach trait. Your Strikes with that weapon deal an extra 2d6 positive or negative damage (whichever is more effective against the target).
