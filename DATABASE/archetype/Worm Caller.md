# Worm Caller

**Source** [[Pathfinder 194. Cult of the Cave Worm]]
You follow the ancient [[Duergar]] tradition of the worm caller—mystics who can call upon the strength and destructive force of the mighty [[Cave Worm]] that inhabit the Darklands. You can manifest worms to attack your enemies, draw upon their senses and resistances, summon one to do your bidding and, eventually, become a worm yourself.

Your flesh grows thick and bloated, protecting you against harm. You gain resistance equal to half your level versus one of the following types of damage, chosen when you take the feat: fire, cold, or bludgeoning. This choice cannot be changed.
 When you're unarmored, your flesh gives you a +2 item bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of +3. You can apply with armor potency runes and property runes directly to your flesh, though excruciatingly painful.
**Special** You can take this feat up to three times, each time selecting a new damage type from the list.

You can connect with [[Cave Worm]] (and other worm-related creatures, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make an Impression]] on cave worms and to make simple [[Request]] of them.

You take on the form of a purple worm or transform into a humanoid-worm hybrid, retaining your own head but with a worm's body, transforming into a Huge battle form. You must have enough space to expand into or the ability is lost. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the form.
 You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

* AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.

Your attack modifier is +25, and you use the listed damage. Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[Enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
* [[Athletics]] modifier of +30, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:
