# Worm Caller

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 194. Cult of the Cave Worm|Pathfinder #194: Cult of the Cave Worm]]
You follow the ancient [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Duergar|hryngar]] tradition of the worm caller—mystics who can call upon the strength and destructive force of the mighty [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Cave Worm|cave worms]] that inhabit the Darklands. You can manifest worms to attack your enemies, draw upon their senses and resistances, summon one to do your bidding and, eventually, become a worm yourself.

You take on the form of a purple worm or transform into a humanoid-worm hybrid, retaining your own head but with a worm's body, transforming into a Huge battle form.
