You've studied the basics of harmony and resonance in magic, exemplified by the ringing of chimes. You gain a single arcane or occult cantrip of your choice, heightened to a spell level equal to half your level, rounded up. If you weren't already, you become trained in that tradition's spell DCs and spell attack rolls, with Intelligence as your spellcasting ability if you choose arcane or Charisma as your spellcasting ability if you choose occult. Regardless of your choice, you also either become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]], or an expert in one of these skills if you are already trained in both.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Nantambu Chime-Ringer archetype.

You strike magical tones that can turn the tide of combat. You and your allies within 30 feet gain the effects of one of the following runes until the end of your next turn: [[DATABASE/equipment/Corrosive|corrosive]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Disrupting|disrupting]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Flaming|flaming]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Frost|frost]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Ghost Touch|ghost touch]], [[DATABASE/equipment/Shock|shock]], or [[DATABASE/equipment/Thundering|thundering]]. The effects apply to a single weapon the creature is holding or one of the creature's unarmed attacks. You choose the rune and the effect applies to all creatures. You can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to extend the duration of the rune for 1 additional round up to a maximum of 1 minute. If this would give a weapon or unarmed attack more property runes than its normal maximum, an existing property rune (as the creature chooses) is suppressed until the spell ends.
