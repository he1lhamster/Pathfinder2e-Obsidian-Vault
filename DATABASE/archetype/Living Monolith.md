**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Living Monolith]]**Prerequisites** [[Osiriani]] and [[Sphinx]] languages; trained in [[Crafting]]
**Access** You are from the Golden Road region.

---
You’ve begun to inscribe a magical stone called a _ka stone_ that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent _ka stone_. If you fail a recovery check while [[Dying]], your dying condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your dying condition increases by only 1. You become trained in Ancient Osirion [[Lore]], or expert if you were already trained.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the living monolith archetype.

PFS Note_ The Prerequisites entry for Ka Stone Ritual is “Living Monolith Dedication” rather than “Living Monolith Dedication, a sphinx or living monolith with this feat performs a ritual with you”. Characters with the Living Monolith Dedication feat have access to Ka Stone Ritual_
**Archetype** [[Living Monolith]]
**Prerequisites** [[Living Monolith Dedication]]; a [[Sphinx]] or living monolith with this feat performs a ritual with you

---
You inscribe your true name on your _ka stone_, as well as oaths to gods and pharaohs, and embed it in your forehead in a special ritual with a sphinx or with a living monolith who already has this feat. The _ka stone_ is an invested magic item that you automatically invest each day. It can’t be removed without your permission, nor can it be dispelled, and you can never lose investiture in the ka stone. Its Bulk is negligible.
 The ka stone grants you a +1 item bonus to saves against death effects and negative effects, which increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">2</span> (envision), or a different activation if otherwise specified **Frequency** a number of times each day equal to the number of class feats you have from the Living Monolith archetype; **Effect** You cast [[Enlarge]] on yourself or use one of the other activated abilities granted by a later Living Monolith feat.
