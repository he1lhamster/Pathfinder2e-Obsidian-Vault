# Sentinel

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Armor offers solid, reassuring protection in combat, and as someone who faces danger on a regular basis, you have made it your business to get the most out of your defenses. You stand solid on any battlefield, encased in the sturdiest armor you can find. When danger threatens, your solid defenses will safely get you, and possibly your companions, home again. As a sentinel, you might be a member of an order of knights or bodyguards that trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor. On the other hand, you might just be an adventurer who took one too many scrapes and decided that enough was enough, so you trained yourself to wear the heaviest plate you could get your hands on. Some witches or sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel to increase their survivability.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Sentinel Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Sentinel]]

---
You have trained carefully to maximize the protective qualities of your armor. You become trained in light armor and medium armor. If you already were trained in light armor and medium armor, you gain training in heavy armor as well. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in any type of armor (but not unarmored defense), you also gain that proficiency in the armor types granted to you by this feat. If you are at least 13th level and you have a class feature that grants you expert proficiency in unarmored defense, you also become an expert in the armor types granted to you by this feat.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sentinel archetype.

You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back your foe. Attempt an [[Athletics]] check to [[Shove]] the triggering foe, even if you don't have a hand free. If you succeed, you can't Stride to follow the foe, as you're knocking the foe back with the rebounded attack, not by physically moving towards them.

---
With divine awareness, you twist your body to lessen the impact of an attack. Reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to twice your armor's level. Your armor becomes broken, reducing its Hit Points to its Broken Threshold. If your armor was already damaged, it is destroyed instead.

## [[Greater Interpose]] <span class="item-type">Feat 16*</span>

Your divine grace empowers you to avoid hits when you otherwise could not. You can use [[Sacrifice Armor]] to reduce any type of damage from an attack or effect requiring a Reflex save. When you use Sacrifice Armor against a critical hit or a critical failure on a Reflex save that would otherwise cause you to take double damage, you take the normal amount of damage instead.
