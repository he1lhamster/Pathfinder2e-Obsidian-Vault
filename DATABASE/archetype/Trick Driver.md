# Trick Driver

## Using Vehicles

While many of the options in this book are uncommon to allow you to insert the thematic elements into your game as you see fit, there are some options you should consider very carefully before including. This archetype is one of them. Vehicles are relatively complicated and can move very fast, which can make mapping encounters quite difficult. They can also move characters too far from the fight for other participants to respond. Think carefully before deciding whether to include the trick driver archetype, and make sure that vehicle use is right for your campaign's style and encounter area size.

While [[Cavalier]] follow an old and tired tradition of mounted combat, you take a more modern road. Through aggressive use of vehicles, you roll across the battlefield, taking down your opponents. You go beyond simply operating a vehicle, pushing it to perform stunts that its builders never intended, transforming the vehicle into something much greater than a mere conveyance.

---
You are equally at home piloting any vehicle, adapting yourself instantly to varied controls, movements, and handling. Whenever piloting a vehicle requires a [[Lore]] or Sailing Lore check, you can use your Driving Lore proficiency instead. You can use Dexterity in place of Intelligence when attempting piloting checks with Driving Lore. You become an expert in Driving Lore. At 7th level, you become a master in Driving Lore, and at 15th level, you become legendary in Driving Lore.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the trick driver archetype.

You can optimize your vehicle's performance, coaxing extra speed and choosing paths to avoid slowdowns. When calculating your travel speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a [[Lore]] check to increase your vehicle's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your vehicle's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters.
