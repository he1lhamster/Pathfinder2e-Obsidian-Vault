# Harrower

**Source** [[Stolen Fate Player's Guide]]
Whether or not the revelations and divinations of a typical harrow card reading are trustworthy, none can deny that the strange powers wielded by the harrower are real. The harrower uses the ancient art of fortune-telling to harness destiny and augment their spellcasting abilities, infusing them with power by drawing cards from their harrow deck and letting fate decide what elements of their magic need augmentation. For many years, the traditions of the harrower were limited to regions like Varisia and Ustalav, where the Varisian people had more deeply established traditions. But recently, particularly as Varisia's importance in Avistan has grown, harrowers have begun to spread across the world of Golarion.

You become trained in [[Occultism]]; if you are already trained in this skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice instead. You also become trained in [[Lore]], and you learn the [[Harrowing]] ritual.
 In addition, once a day when you perform your daily preparations, you can perform a harrow reading for yourself if you have access to a [[Harrow Deck]]. Draw a card from your harrow deck—that card's suit becomes your active harrow omen for the next 24 hours and modifies several other harrower feats as detailed on the following pages. You gain the Avoid Dire Fate reaction.
 **Avoid Dire Fate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> (fortune) **Requirements** you have an active harrow omen; **Trigger** you fail or critically fail a check associated with your harrow omen's suit; **Effect** Treat the failure as a success or a critical failure as a failure. You no longer have an active harrow omen.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the harrower archetype. If you retrain out of this feat, you lose the _harrowing_ ritual you learned from it.

When you perform the [[Harrowing]] ritual, the DC for the Primary Check is never more than the standard DC by level, and the cost for the ritual is halved. If you use a [[Harrow Deck]], the cost for the ritual is removed entirely.

You draw a card from your harrow deck just before you cast a spell to infuse your magic with its destined potential. If your next action is to Cast a Spell, the suit of the card you draw enhances the spell in one of the following ways. If the card you draw matches the suit of your active harrow omen, the effect is enhanced further as detailed below. When you Harrow Cast, attempt a DC 11 flat check. If you fail this check, you lose your active harrow omen at the end of your turn.

* **Hammer** The force of the spell is enhanced. This effect only enhances single-target offensive spells that require you to make a successful spell attack or require a saving throw from the target to resist. If you hit the target, or if they fail their saving throw, the spell inflicts additional force damage equal to the spell's level. This additional damage doubles if your harrow omen is Hammers.
* **Key** Some of the magic remains behind, infusing your defenses. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to your AC and all saving throws. If your harrow omen is Keys, this increases to a +2 status bonus.
* **Shield** As the spell's magic takes effect, it heals you as well, restoring Hit Points equal to 2d6 + the spell's level. If your harrow omen is Shields, the Hit Points restored increases to 4d6 + twice the spell's level.
* **Book** The spell's magic infuses your mind with sudden insights about the target. You can attempt to [[Recall Knowledge]] about the target as a free action, using your spell attack roll to make the check. You gain a +2 status bonus to this roll if Books is your harrow omen.
* **Star** The spell's magic bolsters those it aids. This effect only enhances single-target spells cast on willing subjects. The magic restores Hit Points to the affected target equal to 2d6 + the spell's level. If your harrow omen is Stars, the magic also grants the target a +2 status bonus to all saving throws until the start of your next turn.
* **Crown** The spell's magic is hidden and subtle, and observers may not realize you're doing anything more than manipulating cards in your harrow deck. Attempt a [[Lore]] check against all observer's Perception DCs. If your check is successful against an observer's Perception DC, that observer doesn't notice you are Casting a Spell, even though normally spells have sensory manifestations. This hides only the spell's spellcasting actions and manifestations, not its effects. If your harrow omen is Crowns, you gain a +2 status bonus to your Fortune-Telling Lore check.

You spend 10 minutes meditating with your harrow deck, then draw a card. The suit of the card grants you a new harrow omen.

You manifest a ghostly deck of harrow cards that seek to protect you or an ally. Select one willing target within 30 feet; the cards move through the air to surround that target, protecting them from harm and granting a +1 status bonus to AC and resistance 5 to a type of damage associated with your active harrow omen (see below). This resistance increases to 10 if you're at least 10th level and 15 if you're 15th level. This effect lasts as long as you sustain it, up to 1 minute, or until you no longer have an active harrow omen. Once the effect ends, you lose your active harrow omen.

* **Hammers**: cold damage
* **Keys**: fire damage
* **Shields**: poison damage
* **Books**: electricity damage
* **Stars**: mental damage
* **Crowns**: acid damage

You immediately learn two of the following rituals: [[Astral Projection]], [[Call Spirit]], [[Commune]], [[Commune with Nature]], [[Legend Lore]], or [[Planar Binding]]. When you perform any ritual, you can incorporate harrow cards into the ritual to gain a +2 status bonus to all skill checks made to resolve the effects of the ritual. You can take this feat more than once; each time you do, you learn two new rituals.

You manifest a ghostly deck of harrow cards. Draw a card from a harrow deck, then select a target within 60 feet. The card flies through the air to strike at that target, inflicting 4d6 damage, with a basic saving throw against your class DC. The type of damage inflicted is determined by your active harrow omen; if the card drawn is in the same suit as your active harrow omen, the target takes a –2 status penalty to its saving throw. The damage increases to 6d6 if you're 10th level and 8d6 if you're 15th level. You can continue to throw cards at targets on your turn as long as you Sustain the Vengeful Spirit Deck—throwing a card takes two actions. This effect lasts as long as you Sustain it, up to 1 minute, or until you no longer have an active harrow omen. Once the effect ends, you lose your active harrow omen.

* **Hammers**: cold damage
* **Keys**: fire damage
* **Shields**: poison damage
* **Books**: electricity damage
* **Stars**: mental damage
* **Crowns**: acid damage

You have a knack for drawing the right card, be it from a harrow deck, in a game of cards, or even when drawing from a [[Deck of Many Things]]. When you're attempting a skill check involving the drawing of cards or resolving the effects of a divination effect (including attempting a saving throw against a hostile divination effect against you), you gain a +2 status bonus to the check. When you draw a card to determine your harrow omen, perform [[Harrow Casting]], cast [[Harrowing]], or if you activate a magical deck of cards, draw 2 cards, and choose the one you prefer as your actual card drawn. You can even use this ability when drawing from a _Deck of Many Things_, but only once per deck. The unused card is shuffled back into the stack.
