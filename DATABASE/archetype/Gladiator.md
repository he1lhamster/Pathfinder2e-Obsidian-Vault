# Gladiator

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
The roar of the crowd and thrill of competitive combat drive you to become the best—and the fame isn't bad either. 
If there are sapient creatures observing a combat encounter, and these onlookers are neither engaged in the combat themselves nor allied or affiliated with either side, the combatants have spectators. The GM is the final arbiter.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

**Archetype** [[Gladiator]]

You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment. You become trained in [[Lore]]; if already trained in Gladiatorial Lore, you instead become trained in another Lore skill of your choice. 
At the start of a combat encounter, if you have spectators, you gain a number of temporary HP equal to your character level for 1 minute and you can roll [[Performance]] for your initiative.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the gladiator archetype.

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>

## [[Play to the Crowd]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Gladiator]]
**Prerequisites** [[Gladiator Dedication]]
**Trigger** You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points during a non-trivial combat encounter with spectators.

---
You show off for the crowd. Attempt a [[Performance]] check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [[Make an Impression]] on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, choose one of the following benefits; on a critical success, choose two benefits:

* A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your character level; these last for 1 minute.
* A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
* A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your next turn.

## [[Stage Fighting]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Gladiator]]
**Prerequisites** [[Gladiator Dedication]]

---
You pull punches to give a better show. You don't take the usual –2 circumstance penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon or unarmed attack that doesn't have the nonlethal trait.

## [[Performative Weapons Training]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Gladiator]]
**Prerequisites** [[Gladiator Dedication]]

---
You're skilled with flashy weapons. You are trained with the [[Bo Staff]], [[Dueling Cape]], [[Spiked Chain]], [[Sword Cane]], and [[Whip]]. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the weapons listed.

## [[Call Your Shot]] <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Gladiator]]
**Prerequisites** [[Play to the Crowd]]

---
When you successfully [[Play to the Crowd]], add the following to the list of benefits you can choose from:

* Choose a creature within 30 feet that can see you to become [[Frightened]]. This effect has the emotion, fear, mental, and visual traits.

## [[Living for the Applause]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Firebrands]]
**Archetype** [[Gladiator]]
**Frequency** once per day
**Prerequisites** [[Gladiator Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points (but not immediately killed) during a combat encounter that has spectators.

---
Nothing can stop you as long as you have an audience cheering you on. The attention reinvigorates you and keeps you from being knocked out. You remain at 1 Hit Point, and your [[Wounded]] condition increases by 1.
 In addition, attempt a [[Performance]] check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [[Make an Impression]] on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, the crowd erupts in applause and cheers at your comeback, much to the dismay of your enemies. Concern for the crowd's reaction should your opponent deliver a finishing blow gives you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, you don't expend your daily use of Living for the Applause and can use the reaction an additional time on the same day.

## [[Big Debut]] <span class="action-icon">4</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Mental</span>
**Source** [[Firebrands]]
**Archetypes** [[Celebrity]], [[Gladiator]]
**Frequency** once per day
**Prerequisites** [[Celebrity Dedication]]; [[Gladiator Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You're about to roll initiative.

---
Now's your chance! You're a Firebrand, and the world must know it. You strike a dramatic pose, deliver a snappy quip, or reveal a shocking new costume, captivating everyone who can see you. You don't roll initiative. Instead, you voluntarily go last. Enemies who can see you must attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the enemy is overcome with anticipation for what you'll do next on the battlefield and becomes [[Stunned]] (stunned 2 on a critical failure). As your first action on your first turn, you can Interact to draw or stow an item of light Bulk as a free action; if this item is a small garment or accessory, such as a fan, a pair of gloves, or a wine glass, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based skill checks until the end of your turn.
