# Horizon Walker

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Many long for the open road, but you prefer the trackless wild. You can find safe passage through the most inhospitable terrain in the world—icecaps, deserts, and similar environs are where you're comfortable. Your talents open untrod paths for you and help guide others through the wilderness.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Horizon Walker Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Horizon Walker]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Survival]]

---
You've mastered travel within a specific type of terrain. You gain the [[Favored Terrain]] feat. When in your favored terrain, you gain a +10-foot circumstance bonus to your travel Speed. When other creatures [[Follow the Expert]] with you as a guide in your favored terrain, they gain both the ability to ignore non-magical difficult terrain for the purpose of their travel Speed and the bonus to travel Speed.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the horizon walker archetype.

## [[Acclimatization]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Horizon Walker]]
**Prerequisites** [[Horizon Walker Dedication]]

---
Your time spent in the hostile parts of the world has inured you to extreme climates. In your favored terrain, you gain resistance equal to half your level to all environmental damage and are affected by temperature effects as though they were one step less severe (incredible heat or cold becomes extreme, extreme heat or cold becomes severe, and so on). When other creatures [[Follow the Expert]] with you as a guide in your favored terrain, they too treat temperature effects as one step less severe.

**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You roll initiative.

---
Rebellions require an intricate knowledge of one's surroundings—because you might need to escape at any moment. You remember the locations of escape routes, ambush spots, and cover from a scouting expedition or a previous visit to the area. Roll a d20. At any point during the subsequent combat, you can substitute the result of this roll instead of rolling a d20 on one [[Deception]] check to [[Create a Diversion]] or on one [[Stealth]] check to [[Hide]].

## [[Sure Foot]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Horizon Walker]]
**Prerequisites** [[Horizon Walker Dedication]]; expert in [[Acrobatics]] and [[Athletics]]

---
You know the secrets of moving in your favored terrain. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to move within your favored terrain, such as [[Acrobatics]] checks to [[Balance]] on ice, [[Athletics]] checks to [[Swim]] in rough water, Acrobatics checks to [[Fly]] in windy conditions, and so forth.

## [[Perpetual Scout]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Horizon Walker]]
**Prerequisites** [[Horizon Walker Dedication]]

---
You spot anything out of place in the areas you know best. While in your favored terrain, you always gain the benefits of the [[Scout]] exploration activity, even if you are performing another exploration activity. If you're legendary in [[Survival]], you gain these benefits in any terrain.

## [[Blind-Fight]] <span class="item-type">Feat 10*</span>

---
Your battle instincts make you more aware of [[Concealed]] and [[Invisible]] opponents. You don't need to succeed at a flat check to target concealed creatures. You're not [[Flat-Footed]] to creatures that are [[Hidden]] from you (unless you're flat-footed to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature.
 While you're adjacent to an [[Undetected]] creature of your level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.

## [[Magical Adaptation]] <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>

**Archetype** [[Horizon Walker]]
**Prerequisites** [[Horizon Walker Dedication]]

When an obstacle bars your path, you pull a trick from your sleeve to overcome it. You can cast [[Darkvision]], [[Spider Climb]], and 4th-level [[Water Breathing]] as innate primal spells, each once per day.

## [[Terrain Master]] <span class="item-type">Feat 10*</span>

**Archetype** [[Horizon Walker]]
**Prerequisites** master in [[Survival]]; [[Favored Terrain]]
* This version of the Terrain Master feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Terrain Master]].

---
You adapt to your surroundings in any natural terrain. You can spend 1 hour practicing in your current terrain in order to make it your favored terrain, replacing your current favored terrain temporarily. If you spend a full day out of the new favored terrain, your favored terrain reverts back to your original choice when you took the Favored Terrain feat.

Natural obstacles pose no obstacle to you. You gain the ranger's [[Ranger]] class feature. This allows you to ignore the effects of all non-magical difficult terrain, treat greater difficult terrain as merely difficult terrain, and gives you an additional benefit from Favored Terrain based on the terrain.
