# Horizon Walker

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Many long for the open road, but you prefer the trackless wild. You can find safe passage through the most inhospitable terrain in the world—icecaps, deserts, and similar environs are where you're comfortable. Your talents open untrod paths for you and help guide others through the wilderness.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

Your time spent in the hostile parts of the world has inured you to extreme climates. In your favored terrain, you gain resistance equal to half your level to all environmental damage and are affected by temperature effects as though they were one step less severe (incredible heat or cold becomes extreme, extreme heat or cold becomes severe, and so on). When other creatures [[DATABASE/action/Follow the Expert|Follow the Expert]] with you as a guide in your favored terrain, they too treat temperature effects as one step less severe.

Rebellions require an intricate knowledge of one's surroundings—because you might need to escape at any moment.

Your battle instincts make you more aware of [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] and [[DATABASE/condition/Invisible|invisible]] opponents. You don't need to succeed at a flat check to target concealed creatures. You're not [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to creatures that are [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] from you (unless you're flat-footed to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature.
 While you're adjacent to an [[DATABASE/condition/Undetected|undetected]] creature of your level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
