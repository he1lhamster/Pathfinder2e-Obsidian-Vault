# Celebrity

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You're a special personality... and you know it. You're not merely comfortable in the spotlight, you crave it. While the traditional celebrity is a musician or another type of performer, you could be known for any occupation.

## [[Celebrity Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Celebrity]]

---
The more people you have looking at you, the more content you are, and you take every opportunity to show up others when their performances are less than perfect. You gain the Upstage reaction. In addition, when you [[Earn Income]], if the level of the task is higher than your level, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check to Earn Income.
**Activate** <span class="action-icon">5</span> Upstage **Trigger** A foe attempts a skill check and doesn't get a critical success; **Effect** After your foe has tried their best, you show everyone how it's really done. Attempt a check using the same skill that triggered this reaction.
**Critical Success** You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks until the end of your next turn.
**Success** As critical success, except you gain the benefits only if the triggering creature failed their skill check.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the celebrity archetype.

## [[Never Tire]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>

**Archetype** [[Celebrity]]
**Prerequisites** [[Celebrity Dedication]]
**Trigger** You would gain the [[Fatigued]] condition.
**Requirements** You are [[Observed]] by at least three creatures who aren't foes.

---
As long as you have an audience, you can continue to perform. Indeed, you must—you have an obligation to your fans! You delay the effects of the fatigued condition for 1 minute or until you are no longer observed by the required creatures, whichever comes first. If the fatigued condition has a duration, the duration begins to elapse only after the delay. You can't further delay or prevent the fatigued condition after this ability ends.

Some Firebrands can't stand it when their allies are ruining their moment, and you're no different.

Your ally rerolls the triggering Will saving throw with a +1 circumstance bonus. Regardless of the result of the save, your ally is temporarily immune to You're an Embarrassment! for 10 minutes.

When you meet someone's gaze, they are unable to look away. Choose one target creature.

**Trigger** An enemy within 30 feet damages you or succeeds at a skill check.

---
Every Firebrand can recognize the skill of others, but you've turned it into an art you can wield in combat.

**Prerequisites** [[Celebrity Dedication]]; [[Gladiator Dedication]]
**Access** Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.
**Trigger** You're about to roll initiative.

---
Now's your chance! You're a Firebrand, and the world must know it. You strike a dramatic pose, deliver a snappy quip, or reveal a shocking new costume, captivating everyone who can see you. You don't roll initiative. Instead, you voluntarily go last. Enemies who can see you must attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the enemy is overcome with anticipation for what you'll do next on the battlefield and becomes [[Stunned]] (stunned 2 on a critical failure). As your first action on your first turn, you can Interact to draw or stow an item of light Bulk as a free action; if this item is a small garment or accessory, such as a fan, a pair of gloves, or a wine glass, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based skill checks until the end of your turn.

**Prerequisites** [[Celebrity Dedication]]

You command the attention of all around you with style, ensuring their gaze falls only upon you until the end of your next turn. When creatures within 30 feet of you attempt saving throws against other visual effects, they use the outcome for one degree of success better than the result they rolled. An enemy within the area attempting to use a visual effect that involves focusing its attention on a particular creature (such as a [[Medusa]] Focus Gaze) must succeed at a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, in order to target any creature except you. Allies in the area can attempt to [[Hide]] even if they don't have cover, as you are continually providing a distraction.

Your reputation as a Firebrand precedes you, and you need only make a simple gesture or give a look of recognition to amaze those around you.

The target must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
