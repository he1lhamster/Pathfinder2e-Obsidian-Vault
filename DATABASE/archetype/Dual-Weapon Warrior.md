# Dual-Weapon Warrior

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You're able to effortlessly fight with multiple weapons simultaneously, weaving your weapons together into a storm of quick attacks. To you, continual offense is the best form of defense, and you leave little room for your foes to avoid your whirlwind of weapons.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

Any effects from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or melee Strikes also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and ranged Strikes.

When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes 1d8 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|major striking]] weapon). The target becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.

When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack. When you use [[DATABASE/feat/Double Slice|Double Slice]], if you miss with both Strikes, choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.

Your weapons are a blur, blocking and biting at your foes. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to perform a Twin Riposte. You can use this extra reaction even if you are not benefiting from Twin Parry.
