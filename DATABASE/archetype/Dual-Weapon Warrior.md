# Dual-Weapon Warrior

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You're able to effortlessly fight with multiple weapons simultaneously, weaving your weapons together into a storm of quick attacks. To you, continual offense is the best form of defense, and you leave little room for your foes to avoid your whirlwind of weapons.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

## [[Dual Thrower]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication]]

---
You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with them. Whenever a dual-weapon warrior feat allows you to make a melee Strike, you can instead make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon or a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding. Any effects from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or melee Strikes also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and ranged Strikes.

## [[Dual-Weapon Reload]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication]]
**Requirements** You are wielding two one-handed weapons, each in a different hand, one of which is a ranged weapon.

---
You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to reload while holding two weapons. You Interact to reload a one-handed ranged weapon you're holding. Unlike most Interact actions, you don't need a free hand to reload your ranged weapon in this way.

## [[Twin Parry]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Fighter</span><span class="item-trait">Ranger</span><span class="item-trait">Swashbuckler</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] , [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior]]
**Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, one in each hand.
* This version of the Twin Parry feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Twin Parry]].

---
You use your two weapons to parry attacks. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, or a +2 circumstance bonus if either weapon has the parry trait. You lose this circumstance bonus if you no longer meet this feat's requirement.

## [[Flensing Slice]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 8</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication]]
**Requirements** Your last action was a [[Double Slice]], and both attacks hit the target.

---
When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes 1d8 [[Persistent Damage]] per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a [[Striking]] weapon). The target becomes [[Flat-Footed]], and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.

## [[Dual-Weapon Blitz]] <span class="action-icon">2</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 10</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication]]
**Requirements** You are wielding two one-handed melee weapons, each in a different hand.

---
You attack as you dash among foes. Stride up to your Speed. At any point during this movement, you can Strike once with each of the two required weapons. These Strikes can be against the same or different targets, as you see fit.

## [[Twin Riposte]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 12*</span>

<span class="item-trait">Fighter</span><span class="item-trait">Ranger</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior]]
**Trigger** A creature within your reach critically fails a Strike against you.
**Requirements** You are benefiting from [[Twin Parry]].
* This version of the Twin Riposte feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access than the [[Twin Riposte]].

---
A clever parry with one weapon leaves your opponent open to an attack with the other weapon. Make a melee Strike or use a [[Disarm]] action against the triggering opponent.

## [[Dual Onslaught]] <span class="item-type">Feat 14</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior]]
**Prerequisites** [[Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication]]

---
When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack. When you use [[Double Slice]], if you miss with both Strikes, choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.

Your weapons are a blur, blocking and biting at your foes. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to perform a Twin Riposte. You can use this extra reaction even if you are not benefiting from Twin Parry.

## [[Twinned Defense (Fighter)]] <span class="action-icon">1</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 18*</span>
