# Twilight Speaker

## Ilverani and the Stars

Twilight speakers hold the stars as an enduring reminder of their god's quest for artistic perfection. Although few Ilverani believe that Findeladlara had any hand in the creation of the stars, these astral bodies form an important part of snowcaster beliefs.
 Twilight speakers returning home look to Cynosure, the North Star of Golarion, to guide them. While the short polar summers in the Crown of the World can rob the sky of many stars, Cynosure shines bright and clear more often than not. It is for this reason that the envoys of the Ilverani gave themselves the name of “twilight speakers”: to remember their place as spiritual and diplomatic guides.
 Also in summer, the Aurora Iobara colors the sky in shifting tones. The “great painting,” as it is called in the Ilverani language, is contemplated by fortune tellers and prophets alike. Many Ilverani have noticed changes in the Aurora Iobara that they fear might point to the onset of another great cataclysm like Earthfall. The twilight speakers venture far and wide in search of information to support or dissuade such fears.
 During the long, cold nights of winter, when the stars are clearest, Ilverani hold their night vigils. While the stars turn in the sky above, they act out plays of their histories, tales that remember betrayal and great disasters. The stars are both backdrop and the personification of their ancestors, played by beautiful actresses with magical starlight in their hair.

As a religious and diplomatic representative of [[DATABASE/deity/Findeladlara|Findeladlara]]—and all Ilverani of the north—you see it as your duty to befriend shorter-lived peoples you encounter on your travels. Unlike other Ilverani, also called “snowcaster elves” by outsiders, you find outsiders interesting and believe there is much to learn from having conversations and relationships with others. Whether to watch them, teach them, or to keep would-be enemies close, you believe a broad smile, ageless learning, and a watchful eye are key. Some see this watchful and outwardly friendly nature as condescending, but they don't understand the reason why worshipers of Findeladlara feel a duty to uphold this tradition. When Earthfall struck and most of the other elves on Golarion fled to Sovyrian or delved deep into the earth, the elves that would one day come to be known as Ilverani remained and sought to shelter others from catastrophe. They built refuges to protect others and helped guide people to safety during the Age of Darkness. While Twilight Seekers today don't build safe structures, they do work to build bonds among people so that society can be protected against other catastrophic events should they come to pass.
 This calling brings you in contact with many different cultures, yet you seek to preserve the ways of your people. To this end, you are ever on your guard against the lure of “modern fads.” Unfortunately, some twilight speakers have succumbed to the allure of other ways of life and, for them, there is only one outcome: exile.

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 189. Dreamers of the Nameless Spires|Pathfinder #189: Dreamers of the Nameless Spires]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Twilight Speaker|Twilight Speaker]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]]; you are an Ilverani elf

---
You have carefully studied the histories, customs, and etiquette of many of the younger peoples of Golarion. You become an expert in Society. At 7th level, you become a master in Society, and at 15th level, you become legendary in Society. You can use the Society skill instead of the [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill when you attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on a non-elven intelligent humanoid creature.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the twilight speaker archetype.

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 189. Dreamers of the Nameless Spires|Pathfinder #189: Dreamers of the Nameless Spires]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Twilight Speaker|Twilight Speaker]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Twilight Speaker Dedication|Twilight Speaker Dedication]]

---
You believe that treating others with respect is the fastest way into their hearts, and in turn others are more likely to believe in your good intentions and write off bad first impressions as flukes. If a creature's attitude towards you becomes lower over the course of a social interaction (for example, from [[DATABASE/condition/Friendly|friendly]] to [[DATABASE/condition/Indifferent|indifferent]], or from indifferent to [[DATABASE/condition/Unfriendly|unfriendly]]), their impression of you returns to its starting level an hour after the social interaction ends. This ability has no effect if the creature you are interacting with becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Hostile|hostile]].

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 189. Dreamers of the Nameless Spires|Pathfinder #189: Dreamers of the Nameless Spires]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Twilight Speaker|Twilight Speaker]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Twilight Speaker Dedication|Twilight Speaker Dedication]]
**Requirements** You are within melee reach of a target, but it is not in combat with you.

---
While your usual diplomacy is well intentioned, you know that sometimes those same skills will need to be turned to deception. In a flash, you draw a sheathed or concealed agile or finesse weapon and make a melee Strike. The target is [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against your Strike. You then roll [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] for initiative.

## [[DATABASE/feat/Disarming Smile|Disarming Smile]] <span class="action-icon">5</span> <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span><span class="item-trait">Emotion</span><span class="item-trait">Mental</span><span class="item-trait">Visual</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 189. Dreamers of the Nameless Spires|Pathfinder #189: Dreamers of the Nameless Spires]]
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Twilight Speaker|Twilight Speaker]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Twilight Speaker Dedication|Twilight Speaker Dedication]]
**Trigger** You are the target of a melee attack and the attacker has not rolled yet.
**Requirements** You are aware of the attacker, the attacker is an intelligent humanoid creature, and you have not attempted to harm the attacker.

---
With a wide, sincere smile, you give your attacker pause. You attempt a [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check against the triggering attacker's Will DC. After you use Disarming Smile, all creatures who witnessed you use it are temporarily immune to your Disarming Smile for the next 24 hours.
**Critical Success** Your enemy ceases their attack. The attack fails and the triggering target can't attempt hostile actions against you until the beginning of its next turn or until you (or your allies) take hostile actions against the enemy (or its allies). You can begin talking to the creature on your next turn to attempt another Diplomacy check; on a success, you sustain the effect until the beginning of your next turn, to a maximum of 1 minute. Talking on subsequent rounds requires that you be able to communicate with the target creature and imparts the auditory and linguistic traits to the action.
**Success** Your foe pauses momentarily. Their attack fails, but they can attempt further attacks against you.
**Failure** The target's attack is unaffected.

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Twilight Speaker Dedication|Twilight Speaker Dedication]]

---
All twilight speakers are trained to resist the alluring customs of younger peoples, but you have made it your mandate to keep the Ilverani way unchanged. Such dedication has given you a trained eye for subtlety and deception. When you attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Sense Motive|Sense the Motive]] of a non-elf humanoid creature and you roll a critical failure, you fail instead.

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Twilight Speaker Dedication|Twilight Speaker Dedication]]

---
Your keen study of other cultures gives you insights into the ways those cultures fight. When you use Perception to roll initiative and none of your enemies have the elf trait, you can choose to roll [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] instead.

**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/feat/Disarming Smile|Disarming Smile]]
**Trigger** You roll initiative.

---
You can tell when diplomacy has failed and a meeting is close to unraveling or falling to blows. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your initiative roll. During your first turn in combat, you can use your Disarming Smile, targeting every [[DATABASE/condition/Hostile|hostile]] intelligent humanoid creature that can see you but has yet to act. If you choose to sustain your Disarming Smile, you sustain the effect for only one creature, as normal.
