# Vampire

## Vampire Vulnerabilities

Your power comes with a price. As a vampire, you have the following vulnerabilities.
 **Revulsion**: You can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a [[DATABASE/equipment/Religious Symbol|religious symbol]] of a non-evil deity. A creature must Interact to brandish garlic or a religious symbol for 1 round (similar to [[DATABASE/action/Raise a Shield|Raising a Shield]]). If you involuntarily come within 10 feet of an object of your revulsion, you gain the [[DATABASE/condition/Fleeing|fleeing]] condition, running from the subject of your revulsion until you end an action beyond 10 feet of it. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of your revulsion, you can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, you overcome your revulsions for 1d6 rounds, or 1 hour on a critical success.
 **Sunlight**: If exposed to direct sunlight, you immediately become [[DATABASE/condition/Slowed|slowed 1]]. The slowed value increases by 1 each time you end your turn in sunlight. If you lose all your actions in this way, you are destroyed. Due to your supernatural aversion to light, you don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.

After being exsanguinated by a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire|vampire]], you've risen again, pulling yourself from the earth as an immortal undead. You're a creature of the night, harmed by the light of day and thirsting for blood.

You're a newly risen vampire. You gain the undead and vampire traits and the basic undead benefits, and your undead hunger is for the blood of the living. Your incisors elongate; you gain a fangs unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. They're in the [[DATABASE/weapongroup/Brawling|brawling]] group and have the grapple and unarmed traits. You gain revulsion and sunlight vulnerabilities detailed in the Vampire Vulnerabilities sidebar and the Drink Blood ability.
 **Drink Blood** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (divine, necromancy) **Requirements** A [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]], [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], or willing creature is within your reach; **Effect** You sink your fangs into that creature and drink its blood. This requires an [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed, and automatically succeeds for any of the other conditions. If you succeed, the creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Drained|drained 1]], and you gain temporary HP equal to the target's level that last for 10 minutes. Further uses against the target don't increase the drained condition or grant you more temporary HP.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the vampire archetype.

You bind your spirit to a coffin filled with soil of your homeland, making it a place of recovery. If you rest inside your coffin for 10 minutes, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × half your level. You can still be healed in other ways during that time, though you're [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]] and therefore unable to heal yourself. The GM might allow you to [[DATABASE/action/Refocus|Refocus]] while resting, depending on whether it's a type of Refocusing you can achieve while you slumber.
 If you would be destroyed, you instead remain near death. This doesn't change your [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Wounded|wounded]] value, and you remain unconscious. After 1 hour, you're destroyed. If returned to your coffin before that hour is up, you avoid destruction; if you spend 1 hour resting in your coffin, you regain 1 HP and lose the dying and wounded conditions. You can't be healed in any other way when near death.
 Your coffin can't heal you if you're staked through the chest. You can be staked only if unconscious, and it takes three actions. You lose all benefits of this feat if your coffin is destroyed or the soil is lost. You must procure a new coffin and fill it with soil of your homeland to restore the feat's function.

---
As you fall, your body reacts to defend itself. You Turn to Mist. This doesn't expend a use of Turn to Mist, and you can use Mist Escape even if you've already Turned to Mist in the same day. You take move actions to move directly toward your coffin even though you are at 0 HP, though you aren't conscious and don't have control over how you do so. While at 0 HP in this form, you are unaffected by further damage. You automatically return to your corporeal form, [[DATABASE/condition/Unconscious|unconscious]], if you reach your coffin or after 1 hour when you are destroyed, whichever one comes first.

You stare into your target's eyes and enthrall them, shattering their free will. Once per day, you can cast 7th-level [[DATABASE/spell/Dominate|dominate]] as a divine innate spell, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. It gains the visual trait. At 18th level, the dominate is heightened to 8th level; at 20th level, it's heightened to 9th level. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to your domination for 24 hours, though in most cases, you can't Cast the Spell again within 24 hours. If you are destroyed, all your _dominate_ spells from Dominating Gaze immediately end.
