# Barbarian

**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
There’s a rage deep inside you that sometimes breaks loose, granting you some of the might of a barbarian in addition to your other abilities.

### Multiclass Barbarian characters

The barbarian archetype is a great choice for characters that emphasize Strength and melee attacks more than usual for their class, as long as they can handle Rage’s spellcasting restriction. It’s especially good for characters looking to add more damage.

## [[Barbarian Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span><span class="item-trait">Multiclass</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[Barbarian]]
**Prerequisites** Strength 14; Constitution 14

---
You become trained in [[Athletics]]; if you were already trained in Athletics, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC.
 You can use the Rage action.
 Choose an instinct as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you don’t gain any of the other abilities it grants.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the barbarian archetype.

**Requirements** You aren’t [[Fatigued]] or raging.

---
You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall [[Unconscious]], whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging:

* You deal 2 additional damage with melee Strikes. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile. 
* You take a –1 penalty to AC. 
* You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can [[Seek]] while raging.

After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute.
