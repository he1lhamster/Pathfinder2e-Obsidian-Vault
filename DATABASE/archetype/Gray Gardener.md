# Gray Gardener

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Night of the Gray Death|Night of the Gray Death]]
**The following contains SPOILERS for the _Night of the Gray Death_ adventure!** 
 The Gray Gardeners are the remorseless executioners of Galt. Prior to the events of the adventure, the Gray Gardeners are at best sinister (when not actively pursuing evil) as a malevolent monster controls their organization. After the events of Night of the Gray Death, the organization is broken—leadership is in disarray while the rank-and-file members labor to enforce laws and recapture escaped criminals. The Gray Gardeners still command the respect of Galt's people, however, as their brutal reputation is indelibly etched in the public consciousness over the last fifty years. 
 The following is suitable for heroes to take after the events of _Night of the Gray Death_. You might be a member of the old organization who tried to uphold order despite vindictive directives from above, or you might be someone who recently donned a mask to enforce the law in Galt's new age. Either way, as a Gray Gardener you draw power and authority from being masked and have a reputation for dispassionate justice. 
 Your vigilante identity is that of a Gray Gardener, and you must be wearing a mask to use any of your vigilante feats or you risk exposing your social identity, as described in the [[DATABASE/archetype/Vigilante|vigilante archetype]].

### Vigilante Archetype

The Gray Gardener is accessed using the [[DATABASE/feat/Vigilante Dedication|Vigilante Dedication]] feat, along with membership in the Gray Gardeners. Due to this unique membership, the Archives of Nethys is displaying the Gray Gardener specific feats on its own page.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

---
You have two identities, each with its own name, alignment, and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] action to attempt a Perception check against your [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] DC, as if you were using the [[DATABASE/action/Impersonate|Impersonate]] action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity—a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.
 Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.
 Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to [[DATABASE/action/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the [[DATABASE/spell/Detect Alignment|detect alignment]] spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.
 To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits: social or vigilante. You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the vigilante archetype.

You become trained with the following weapons: [[DATABASE/weapon/Battle Axe|battle axe]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Falchion|falchion]], [[DATABASE/weapon/Greataxe|greataxe]], and [[DATABASE/weapon/Scimitar|scimitar]].

Choose one creature you can see, and loudly declare the creature's life forfeit by your judgment. That creature becomes your condemned foe until they are defeated, you use Harsh Judgment on a different creature, or the encounter ends. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] your condemned foe and on Intimidation checks to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] them. You have a –1 circumstance penalty to Perception checks to [[DATABASE/action/Seek|Seek]] creatures other than your condemned foe and on Intimidation checks to [[DATABASE/action/Demoralize|Demoralize]] anyone other than your condemned foe. You typically can use Harsh Judgment only during an encounter, and if you try to use it to declare someone's life forfeit during exploration or downtime, you are likely to start an encounter.

Your voice can be heard easily by any creatures within 300 feet if you wish, regardless of the level of ambient noise, although your voice can't penetrate silence or similar efect. If you roll [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] for initiative, on the frst round of combat, creatures that haven't acted yet are [[DATABASE/condition/Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to you.

The common folk heed your demands, and though your true foes rarely bend to your commands, when they do the hesitation can cost them the battle. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Command|command]] once every 10 minutes as a 1st-level occult innate spell. 
If you're in your vigilante identity, you can command the target only to approach you, drop prone, or stand in place. If you're in your social identity, you can command the target only to run away or release what the target is holding.

You swing wide, attempting to behead your condemned foe. Make a melee Strike against your condemned foe.

If the condemned foe is reduced to 0 Hit Points by the execution and requires a head to live, they die. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your Execution for 1 day.
