# Mammoth Lord

## What Counts as Megafauna?

The megafauna of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are enormous beasts of intimidating appearance, but they can be hard to otherwise classify. While the most well-known megafauna are mammals—like the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros—not all are. Large dinosaurs like the stegosaurus and triceratops qualify as megafauna, for example, but smaller dinosaurs like raptors don't. A list of well-established megafauna can be found below, but it isn't an exclusive list; other, more unusual, species might be permitted with GM approval. One rule is certain, however: an adult megafauna is always Large or bigger.

* [[DATABASE/monster/Cave Bear|Cave Bear]]: Use a [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Bear|bear's]] statistics for a cave bear animal companion.
* [[DATABASE/monster/Daeodon|Daeodon]]: Use a [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Boar|boar's]] statistics for a daeodon, or giant boar, companion.
* [[DATABASE/monster/Dire Wolf|Dire Wolf]]: Use a [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Wolf|wolf's]] statistics for a dire wolf companion.
* [[DATABASE/monster/Mammoth|Mammoth]]: Use a [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Elephant|elephants's]] statistics for the statistics for an elephant or woolly mammoth animal companion.
* [[DATABASE/monster/Roc|Roc]]: Use [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Bird|bird]] statistics for a young roc.
* [[DATABASE/monster/Smilodon|Smilodon]]: Use [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Cat|cat]] statistics for a smilodon animal companion.
* [[DATABASE/monster/Triceratops|Triceratops]]: Use [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Triceratops|triceratops]] statistics for a triceratops or other armored dinosaur, such as a stegosaurus or ankylosaurus.
* [[DATABASE/monster/Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus]]: Use [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Tyrannosaurus|tyrannosaurus]] statistics for for a tyrannosaurus, allosaurus, or similar dinosaur.
* [[DATABASE/monster/Rhinoceros|Woolly Rhinoceros]]: Use [[DATABASE/animalcompanion/Rhinoceros|rhinoceros]] statistics for a rhinoceros or woolly rhinoceros animal companion.

## Mammoth Lord Animal Companions

If you're playing a mammoth lord, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the rules found here. As a mammoth lord, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype or from another source.

The Kellid people of the far north are collectively known as the Mammoth Lords, but this name is something of a generalization. True Mammoth Lords are rare champions, heroes among their people who have tamed a mammoth, cave bear, triceratops, or other megafauna. They often ride these enormous creatures into battle. Astride their mighty steeds, Mammoth Lords lead their followings along migratory routes they've used for generations, and they defend their people from frost giants, white dragons, and many other perils of the far north.
 You're one of these legendary heroes, a true Mammoth Lord. You've captured or befriended one of the megafauna of the far north and tamed it. This heroic deed is best done as part of an adventure, but if that isn't possible, work with your GM to determine the details of how you managed to make one of these tremendous creatures your companion. You now ride this fantastic beast into battle, fighting from atop its back.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

You've undertaken the ultimate challenge of the Mammoth Lords and tamed a megafauna. You gain a megafauna you tamed as a young animal companion. Your megafauna animal companion must be a megafauna appropriate to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords; see the What Counts as Megafauna? sidebar for guidance and examples. While an animal companion usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size).
 Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can give you a second animal companion. If you have more than one animal companion, you can adventure with only one of them at a time. You can switch between them like a [[DATABASE/archetype/Beastmaster|beastmaster]] does. You gain the Call Companion action, as the beastmaster archetype, and you follow all the other rules found in the Call Companion sidebar.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from this archetype.

If you're attempting an action that requires a particular proficiency rank in Medicine (such as [[DATABASE/action/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]), use your proficiency rank in Nature instead. If the subject of your care is your megafauna and you roll a success on your check, you get a critical success instead.

---
You and your megafauna companion are bound together; as long as you live, it's much harder for your companion to die. If your megafauna companion gains the [[DATABASE/condition/Dying|dying]] condition, it automatically succeeds at the recovery check to stabilize at 0 Hit Points on its turn. Additionally, your megafauna companion only dies at dying 5 rather than dying 4. Finally, the first time each day your megafauna companion would reach dying 5 and die, as long as you're still alive, your companion's dying value decreases to 0 instead.
