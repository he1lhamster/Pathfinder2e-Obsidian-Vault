# Druid

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
You have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order’s secrets, granting you primal power.

### Multiclass Druid characters

The druid archetype can provide a bit of healing or elemental damage and can increase your utility in a natural environment with spells like [[DATABASE/spell/Speak with Animals|speak with animals]] and [[DATABASE/spell/Meld into Stone|meld into stone]].

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
**Archetype** [[DATABASE/archetype/Druid|Druid]]
**Prerequisites** Wisdom 14

---
You cast spells like a druid. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity. You can prepare two common cantrips each day from the primal spell list in this book or any other primal cantrips you learn or discover. You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for primal spells. Your key spellcasting ability for druid archetype spells is Wisdom, and they are primal druid spells.
 You learn the [[DATABASE/language/Druidic|Druidic]] language, and you are bound by the druid's anathema.
 Choose a druidic order. You become a member of that order and are also bound by its specific anathema, allowing you to take the order's feats. You become trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] and your order's associated skill; for each of these skills in which you were already trained, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You don't gain any other abilities from your choice of order.
**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the druid archetype.

Your mask carries the legacy of Verdant Spider, the Speaker of Needs, allowing you to deceive and outwit your foes. You can attempt to [[DATABASE/action/Feint|Feint]] a target from up to 30 feet away, and if you succeed or critically succeed in your Feint attempt, the target of your Feint takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saving throws against your spells until the start of your next turn. If you don't have the [[DATABASE/feat/Conceal Spell|Conceal Spell]] feat, you gain it as a bonus feat, allowing you to disguise your spellcasting from others' eyes. If you already have the Conceal Spell feat, you can use Conceal Spell once per round as a free action instead of as a single action.<span>Masks of the Magic Warriors</span>**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 174.

In becoming Jatembe's new Magic Warriors, the heroes have unlocked secrets of magical potential that none have reached since the earliest Ten Magic Warriors walked the plazas of the Magaambya.
 On reaching 20th level, the heroes should have the option of taking one of these archetype feats, based on the type of animal they chose for their mask when they first created it in _Pathfinder Adventure Path #169: Kindled Magic_. These options are each themed to one of Jatembe's magic warriors, but if a hero's mask doesn't fit with a specific animal from this list or the player feels their animal embodies a different effect from the list, feel free to reflavor the feat names to fit the hero's spirit face. For instance, the Cunning Trickster mask could easily be a rodent or a fox, not just a spider.

Your mask grants you the abilities of Whistling Kite, the Vigilant Seer, who emancipated thousands. When you are attempting a check to free someone else from an effect that [[DATABASE/condition/Immobilized|immobilizes]], [[DATABASE/condition/Paralyzed|paralyzes]], or [[DATABASE/condition/Controlled|controls]] them, roll twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect. The GM might decide that this fortune effect applies when attempting checks to remove other conditions or effects to free another.

Your mask grants the extraordinary magical senses of Carmine Jaws, the Hyena who Looks Between. You gain scent as a precise sense to a range of 60 feet. If you already have scent as a precise sense, increase its range by 60 feet. You can sometimes catch a faint whiff of magic itself. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell, your scent extends between worlds, like Carmine Jaws's own. This causes you to be able to smell ethereal creatures, those in an extradimensional space with an aperture that's within your scent range, incorporeal creatures and objects, and other creatures and objects that are insubstantial or not fully in phase with reality. Unlike your normal scent, this is an imprecise sense.<span>Masks of the Magic Warriors</span>**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 174.

These options are each themed to one of Jatembe's magic warriors, but if a hero's mask doesn't fit with a specific animal from this list or the player feels their animal embodies a different effect from the list, feel free to reflavor the feat names to fit the hero's spirit face. For instance, the Cunning Trickster mask could easily be a rodent or a fox, not just a spider.
