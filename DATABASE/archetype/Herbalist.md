# Herbalist

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
The plants around you can provide more remedies than the finest hospital or temple, and you are skilled in their use.

## [[Herbalist Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Herbalist]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Nature]]; [[Natural Medicine]]

---
You can create remedies and other herbal products. You gain the basic alchemy benefits, though they apply only for herbal items: alchemical items with the healing trait, plus [[Antidote]] and [[Antiplague]]. You gain batches of infused reagents per day equal to your level or half your level if you didn't make your daily preparations in the wilderness. Your advanced alchemy level for creating these is 1 and doesn't increase on its own. You become an expert in [[Nature]] and can use Nature instead of [[Crafting]] to [[Craft]] herbal items. You don't need to be trained in Crafting or have the [[Alchemical Crafting]] feat to do so, and you can use [[Healer's Tools]] instead of [[Alchemist's Tools]].
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the herbalist archetype.

### Alchemical Plant Items

**Source** 
Alchemical plant items are “herbal items,” meaning characters with the herbalist archetype can use their archetype abilities with them.

## [[Fresh Ingredients]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Skill</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Herbalist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Herbalist Dedication]]; expert in [[Nature]]

---
When using [[Natural Medicine]] to [[Treat Wounds]], you can spend a batch of herbs to gain the +2 circumstance bonus from having fresh ingredients, even if not in wilderness. If you spend a batch of herbs in wilderness, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus instead.

## [[Gravelands Herbalist]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Knights of Lastwall]]
**Archetype** [[Herbalist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Herbalist Dedication]]; trained in [[Religion]]
**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

---
Your time with the Knights of Lastwall has taught you the secrets of creating and improving upon Lastwall soup. Add [[Lastwall Soup]] to your list of herbal items. At 10th level, you can make an improved version of Lastwall soup that grants a +3 item bonus. At 18th level, you can make a greater version of Lastwall soup that grants a +4 item bonus, and its nourishing properties grant you 10 temporary Hit Points that last up to 10 minutes after eating it.

## [[Poultice Preparation]] <span class="item-type">Feat 4</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Herbalist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Herbalist Dedication]]

---
When you create an herbal elixir, you can prepare it as a poultice instead. A poultice gains the oil trait (but remains alchemical, not magical) and loses the elixir and ingested traits. You can apply a poultice by Interacting with one hand. When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item's normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of [[Persistent Damage]], with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

## [[Endemic Herbs]] <span class="item-type">Feat 6</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Herbalist]]
**Prerequisites** [[Herbalist Dedication]]; trained in [[Survival]]

---
During your daily preparations, you find medicinal plants endemic to your location. Until your next preparations, you can spend an additional batch of herbs to add a benefit to an item you create with your herbalism. The benefit of the special herbs affects the creature that the item is applied to; if the benefit is not immediate, it lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated. This adjustment counts as an additive, so you can't include another additive without spoiling the item.

* **Aquatic** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves.
* **Arctic** For 1 hour, treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less severe.
* **Desert** For 1 hour, treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less severe.
* **Forest** Gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against disease and poison effects.
* **Mountain** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves.
* **Plains** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves.
* **Swamp** Remove one source of [[Persistent Damage]].
* **Underground** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception.

Your advanced alchemy level for herbalism increases to your level – 3. You gain the formulas for [[Elixir of Life]] as soon as your advanced alchemy level is high enough to create them: lesser at 8th level, moderate at 12th level, greater at 16th level, and major at 18th level.
