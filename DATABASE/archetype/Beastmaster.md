# Beastmaster

## Beastmaster Animal Companions

If you're playing a beastmaster, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the rules found here. As a beastmaster, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source.

### [[Call Companion]]

<span class="item-trait">Exploration</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]]

---
You spend 1 minute calling for a different animal companion, switching your active companion for another of your animal companions.

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You attract the loyalty of animals, and as your powers increase you can command more of them, briefly inhabit their body to perceive what they perceive, and even communicate with them over vast distances. Your animals may see you as a beloved parent, teacher, and mentor, or they may consider you a poor, defenseless cub that needs protection. Regardless, they will fight for you and alongside you, even sacrificing their lives for you if necessary.

# Additional Feats

**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of additional feats includes the feat's name, its level, and the page number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait doesn't have that class trait.

**Note**: Warden spells granted by these feats are beastmaster focus spells for you.

## [[Beastmaster Dedication]] <span class="item-type">Feat 2</span>

<span class="item-trait">Archetype</span><span class="item-trait">Dedication</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
**Archetype** [[Beastmaster]]
**Prerequisites** trained in [[Nature]]

---
You gain the service of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys your commands. The rules for animal companions appear here. Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can grant you a second animal companion. If you ever have more than one animal companion, you gain the Call Companion action. See the Beastmaster Animal Companions sidebar for details on this action.
 Certain beastmaster feats give you primal focus spells. The rules for focus spells appear here. When you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you become trained in primal spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma. Feats that grant beastmaster focus spells tell you to increase the number of Focus Points in your pool, but if you don't already have a focus pool, you instead get a focus pool with 1 Focus Point. You can [[Refocus]] by grooming, feeding, playing with, or otherwise tending to an animal companion.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the beastmaster archetype.

You can have up to two animal companions active at once. However, when you do, it's slightly more difficult to [[Command an Animal]] them. If you don't Command either of your companions, one of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike, as per [[Mature Beastmaster Companion]], but not both. When you Command an Animal, either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to Stride or Strike. Either way, you can't Command an Animal to make either companion act again until your next turn.
