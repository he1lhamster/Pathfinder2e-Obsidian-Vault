# Horse

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
Horses serve as mounts and beasts of burden in many societies. They are loyal and typically gentle creatures, and they are invaluable to those looking to travel long distances. Smaller folk, like gnomes and halflings, often utilize ponies as mounts, while horses are the favored steeds for humans and other Medium humanoids. Most horses that the average humanoid encounters are domesticated, though large herds of these powerful animals can be found in the wild.

###  Goblins and Horses

Goblins have many superstitions and quirks, but few of them are stronger than their fear and hatred of horses. This isn’t a one-sided affair. Horses also fear and hate goblins, and some have been known to go out of their way to harm a goblin. A goblin trying to mount a horse is nearly always subject to a torrent of violent bucking, as the horse does everything in its power to fling the goblin to the ground and within reach of its hooves.
