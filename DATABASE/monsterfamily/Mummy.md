While many cultures practice mummification of the dead for benign reasons, undead mummies are created through foul rituals, typically to provide eternally vigilant guardians.

###  Mummification Practice

Neophytes to mummification typically apprentice to a morgue specializing in the process. Apprenticeships can last several years. Generally, the first mummies one produces are animals, usually of inferior quality. Those who become skilled remain rare enough to be a strategic resource and could be abducted, coerced, or bribed to change their allegiance or sabotage the mummification of their masters.
