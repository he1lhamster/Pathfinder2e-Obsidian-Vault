# Bogeyman

**Source** [[Pathfinder 152. Legacy of the Lost God]]
Bogeymen are stealers of innocence and devourers of souls. Few targets who survive an encounter with them remain unchanged. Different names are given to bogeymen according to their varying sizes and degrees of power, which typically advance as the monsters consume more souls.

### Members

[[Bogey]] (Creature 3), [[Bogeyman]] (Creature 10), [[Bugaboo]] (Creature 6)

###  Bogey Origins

While bogeymen stem from bugaboos and bugaboos from bogeys, it is unknown where, exactly, bogeys come from. If superstitious storytellers are to be believed, then bogeys arise from the unfortunate victims kidnapped by bogeymen. According to these tales, victims go missing for months or even years before returning as bogeys to the town they once called home.

###  Epidemic of Terror

Bogeymen and their lesser kin delight in instilling fear in small communities where gossip can quickly amplify their shadowy deeds. In such locales, bogeymen use peoples’ natural tendency to spread misinformation to sow discord and escape notice—for who would rightfully believe that an actual bogeyman is behind the latest murder?
