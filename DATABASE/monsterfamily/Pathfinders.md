# Pathfinders

**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
Many of the greatest explorers and adventurers of the modern age have recorded their discoveries in an ongoing series of chapbooks known as the Pathfinder Chronicles, published irregularly by the Pathfinder Society itself. This diverse group is devoted to exploring the world, supporting its agents in the field, and ensuring the discoveries they make are documented. The Society often finds itself in conflict with the more mercenary Aspis Consortium. The Pathfinder Society's pursuit of discovery often puts its agents in the thick of developing plots, forcing them to choose between being heroes or villains as events unfold.
