Commonly mistaken for undead, animated bones are mindless constructs with no connection to necromancy. The following are examples of typical animated bones.

###  More Bones

Other animated bones exist: those made from humanoid bones include serpentine spines, spinning shoulder blades, and wrestling arms. Some animated bone creatures are crafted into twisted mockeries of other creatures made up of amalgams of misplaced bones, while others are simply the animated bones of much larger creatures, such as stampeding elephant ribcages.

###  Where Bones Walk

Animated bones only exist where people intentionally create them, and the creator must take care to avoid disturbing lingering souls connected to the bones. Generally, the bones used are from creatures who were properly laid to rest or passed away long ago. In old Graydirge, corpse renderers forcibly separated souls and flesh from bones, leaving plenty of raw materials for their twisted creations.
