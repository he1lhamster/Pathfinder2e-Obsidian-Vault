# Hippopotamus

**Source** [[Bestiary 2]] 
Hippopotamuses, or hippos for short, are semiaquatic animals that spend most of their time in rivers and lakes, but they also can thrive on land.

### Members

[[Behemoth Hippopotamus]] (Creature 10), [[Hippopotamus]] (Creature 5)

###  Hippo Sweat

A hippopotamus's sweat is an unusual reddish color that can lend them an even more frightening appearance that evokes the visage of a blood-coated monster. This sweat helps to protect the hippopotamus from becoming overheated, but it also bolsters their resistance to all manner of diseases.
