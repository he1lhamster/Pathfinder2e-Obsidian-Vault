###  Hippo Sweat

A hippopotamus's sweat is an unusual reddish color that can lend them an even more frightening appearance that evokes the visage of a blood-coated monster. This sweat helps to protect the hippopotamus from becoming overheated, but it also bolsters their resistance to all manner of diseases.
