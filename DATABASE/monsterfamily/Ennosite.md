# Ennosite

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
The [[DATABASE/plane/Astral Plane|Astral Plane]] is a planar nexus, connecting the planes of the Inner Sphere to those of the Outer Sphere, a realm of timeless silver substance charged with mental essence drawn from throughout the Great Beyond. Most creatures on the Astral Plane are visitors—predators seeking to poach from the River of Souls, [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Psychopomp|psychopomps]] guarding against such incursions, and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Aeon|aeons]] monitoring the flow of raw quintessence through the Antipode. Yet, this plane has spawned creatures native to its strange currents and eddies, foremost of which is the family of thought-spawned creatures known as ennosites.
 An ennosite's form physically embodies of its thought and purpose. As some ideals and goals are shared, so are certain forms.
