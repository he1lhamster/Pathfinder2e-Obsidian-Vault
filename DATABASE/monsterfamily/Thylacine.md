# Thylacine

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Kingmaker Adventure Path|Kingmaker Adventure Path]]
The thylacine is a marsupial carnivore. This nocturnal predator typically hunts alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Because of their odd appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities.

In the Inner Sea region, thylacines are rare outside the Stolen Lands. However, much larger breeds of thylacines—some the size of horses or even larger—dwell in southern Arcadia and on the plains of central Casmaron.
