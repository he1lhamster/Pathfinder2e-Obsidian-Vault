# Revenant

**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
A revenant is a vengeful undead who stalks the one who killed them in life. They're relentless in the pursuit of their murderer, seeking a final justice. The revenant presented in _Bestiary 2_ is just one variant of this undead. Others can be found, each varying by the circumstances of their death.
