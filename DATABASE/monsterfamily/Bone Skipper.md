# Bone Skipper

**Source** [[Pathfinder 158. Sixty Feet Under]]
Orange-headed bone skippers feast on the flesh of the dead, particularly seeking out the marrow in the bones of large carcasses. These strange flies are named for the way they hop about on rotting bodies as they feed, causing the corpses to move and appear as if alive.

### Members

[[Bone Skipper Swarm]] (Creature 6), [[Giant Bone Skipper]] (Creature 7)

###  Megafauna Scavengers

Bone skippers eat and breed within the bones of deceased megafauna, such as [[Elephant]] and [[Teraphant]]. In areas where their carcasses are rare or quickly disposed of, bone skippers are virtually unknown. Sufficiently large undead creatures, like [[Zombie Hulk]], might harbor a bone skipper swarm that buzzes around them, defending their gruesome “lairs.”
