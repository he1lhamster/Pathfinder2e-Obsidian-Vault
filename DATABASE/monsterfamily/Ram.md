# Ram

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
Rams are sturdy, stubborn herd animals suited to rugged terrain and cold weather. Regardless of their territory, all share a stubborn nature and surefootedness, navigating uncertain terrain with ease and weathering all seasons in scattered herds.

###  Mindspun Rams

Rosethorn rams developed their unique horns along the steep slopes of the rugged Mindspin Mountains in western Avistan, where foraging is scarce but abundant natural caverns provide shelter from predators and the elements. Though the creatures have since spread, most cultures in Avistan refer to them as Mindspin rams.
