# Eurypterid

**Source** [[Bestiary 3]]
Fearsome predators and durable pests, eurypterids are hard-carapaced arthropods sometimes referred to as sea scorpions. Though aquatic creatures, they have robust respiratory systems that allow them to survive indefinitely on land. All eurypterids possess claws as well as stingers that can inject venom.

###  Acquired Taste

The meat of a eurypterid is generally considered an acquired taste, as the flesh turns gelatinous when heated, but those who enjoy it claim its taste falls somewhere between sweet shrimp and crab. A market exists for eurypterid meat, especially for more dangerous varieties like the spiny eurypterid, but supply remains low as most fishermen won't risk baiting a creature that could ruin an entire day's catch.
