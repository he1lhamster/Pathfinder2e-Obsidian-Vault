# Officers

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gamemastery Guide|Gamemastery Guide]]
Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect this), imposing severe punishments on those who can't pay for mercy.

### Members

[[DATABASE/npc/Archer Sentry|Archer Sentry]] (Creature 2), [[DATABASE/npc/Barrister|Barrister]] (Creature -1), [[DATABASE/npc/Captain of the Guard|Captain of the Guard]] (Creature 6), [[DATABASE/npc/Executioner|Executioner]] (Creature 6), [[DATABASE/npc/Guard|Guard]] (Creature 1), [[DATABASE/npc/Jailer|Jailer]] (Creature 3), [[DATABASE/npc/Watch Officer|Watch Officer]] (Creature 3)

###  Deploying The Watch

If no guard is present, it takes at least 1–2 rounds for a civilian to find a guard to sound an alarm whistle. If a guard was on the scene, they sound the alarm immediately. Reinforcements typically arrive 2–3 rounds later.

###  Jailbreak!

If a PC or ally gets imprisoned, the group might plot a jailbreak. For a complex jail or penitentiary, this might require use of the infiltration subsystem. With a smaller town or city jail with a simple structure and small staff, it could require just a bit of force. The jailbreak might just be the beginning, leading to additional adventure!

###  Raise The Alarm!

In a settlement with an alarm, brawls or other major disruptions trigger an alarm 1 round after the watch is alerted. Guards start to arrive after about 5 rounds, usually in patrols of 2 or 3 members, with larger groups of 8–12 near important locations.

###  Unusual Misdemeanors

* Altering the weather without a permit
* Consuming (or refusing to consume) intoxicating substances on celebration days
