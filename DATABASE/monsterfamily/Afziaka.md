[[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire, Vrykolakas|Vrykolakas vampires]] use animals as tools to carry their spirits when they would otherwise be slain. The animal usually dies as the vampire is reborn, but some live on in painful starvation

Most [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Vampire, Vrykolakas|vrykolakas]] can't afford to be choosy about which animal they possess when their existence is threatened, but experienced vrykolakas prefer larger animals in the hopes of gaining an afziaka out of their forced rebirth. Generally, afziaka brutes only arise from vrykolakas masters, and afziaka stalkers only arise from powerful vrykolakas ancients.
