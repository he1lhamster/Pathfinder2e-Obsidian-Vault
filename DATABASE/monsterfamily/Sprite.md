# Sprite

**Source** [[Bestiary]]
Elusive, flighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers first imagine when they hear the terms “fey” or “fairy.” While their dispositions vary from the benevolent grig to the trickster pixie, all sprites share a connection to magic and diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most populous member, the common sprite.

### Members

[[Draxie]] (Creature 3), [[Ether Sprite]] (Creature -1), [[Ether Sprite Swarm]] (Creature 3), [[Grig]] (Creature 1), [[Melixie]] (Creature 0), [[Nyktera]] (Creature -1), [[Pixie]] (Creature 4), [[Sprite]] (Creature -1)

###  Sprite Pranks

Sprite pranks tend to be kind‑hearted in nature; they might use their abilities to embarrass a braggart or to trick them into a convoluted scheme to help someone notice an admirer who has been there for them all along. Their plans are often half-baked; sprites’ mercurial nature means they can easily become distracted by something new before following through on a previous plan.
