# Giant Bee

**Source** [[Pathfinder 169. Kindled Magic]]
Like their smaller counterparts, giant bees are highly territorial. Many types of giant bees construct hives in caves or abandoned buildings and are quick to attack creatures that they deem a threat to the single fertile queen, who almost never leaves the hive. Although most common in warm biomes with lots of vegetation, some giant bees live in arid or cold environments and are solitary rather than hive-dwelling.

###  Hive Minds

Bees communicate with each other using complex combinations of movement and pheromones. They can share detailed information, particularly related to food, water, and dangers. A queen bee doesn't have the ability to directly control members of her hive, but she guides the entire hive's activities and, when necessary, its relocation. Some [[Druid]] have attempted to tap into this hive mind to control giant bee swarms, with limited success.
