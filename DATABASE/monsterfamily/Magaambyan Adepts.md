# Magaambyan Adepts

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Character Guide|Character Guide]] 
Golarion reeled from the disaster of Earthfall, and its peoples took long to recover. But recover they did, and one of the first institutions to rise from the ashes of near destruction was the Magaambya, an academy of arcane learning founded by the legendary wizard known as Old- Mage Jatembe. Today, the scholars of Magaambya not only preserve ancient magical traditions founded in those early days but also protect the learning and culture of the Mwangi people as a whole.
