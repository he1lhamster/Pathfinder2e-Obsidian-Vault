Dreadful creatures that stoke mortal fears, sahkils lurk on the [[Ethereal Plane]] where they slip into nightmares or dark places of the world to torment the living

### Members

[[Chakanaj]] (Creature 14), [[Esipil]] (Creature 1), [[Kimenhul]] (Creature 20), [[Nenchuuj]] (Creature 19), [[Nucol]] (Creature 4), [[Pakalchi]] (Creature 9), [[Penqual]] (Creature 15), [[Tumblak]] (Creature 18), [[Wihsaak]] (Creature 6), [[Ximtal]] (Creature 17)

###  At Home in Cities

Both [[Penqual]] and [[Nenchuuj]] are at home in large cities, but for different reasons. Penquals like slipping in among throngs of people, where they can inflict their terrors upon the lost or disoriented. Nenchuujes stalk magic academies, universities, or other places where spellcasters learn their craft, preying upon spellcasters' imposter syndrome.

###  Check with Friends

Sahkils are creatures of fear and terror. Roleplaying encounters with sahkils could be troubling to some players, and delving deep into the kinds of traumas sahkils relish in unleashing could have unintentional effects on your game and your friends. Before introducing sahkils into your game, talk with your players to learn about any particular phobias or limits to determine what content you bring to the table, and consider that on your own behalf as well. Some specific elements to be aware of are the [[Ximtal]] abilities around sensory deprivation and social isolation, as well as the [[Kimenhul]] trauma-related abilities and themes.

###  Couatls and Sahkils

Legends in Arcadia say that couatls and [[Sahkil]] both rose to prominence as the first mortals walked on Golarion. Each saw unique potential in the mortals; couatls saw hope and the potential to rise to achieve great feats, while sahkils saw the potential for fear. Fearful mortals would never accomplish anything, becoming useless piles of flesh whose souls would languish. These withered souls would be unable to properly travel the River of Souls, disrupting the delicate balance of the afterlife. To this day, couatls work to inspire mortals and push them toward greater tasks while striving to keep the sahkils' terror at bay

###  Embodiments of Fear

All sahkils have horrifying appearances, and each type specializes in exacerbating a specific fear in mortals. [[Penqual]] embody not only a fear of crowds, but also of confined spaces and of being lost within a sea of unfamiliar faces. [[Nenchuuj]] embody both the fear of magic's horrifying side effects as well as the fear that one's own magic might be twisted to an unexpected or tragic end.

###  Feeding on Fear

Sahkils are immortal planar beings and don't require material sustenance, but they do seem to gain some semblance of nourishment from the fear they spread. Whether this is psychological or biological remains to be seen, but their obsession with frightening other creatures is clear. Sahkils recognize that they are already feared, so it may be that they are simply fulfilling what they believe is their ultimate purpose.

###  Planar Relations

Sahkils collaborate with [[Div]] (page 68) to corrupt and corrode mortals. [[Velstrac]], who appreciate sahkils' depredations, sometimes work with these fiends to enact terrible horror on their victims. Nihilistic and disaffected, [[Daemon]] tolerate sahkils but tend to view them as useless provocateurs.

###  Sahkil Tormentors

The most powerful among sahkils are the sahkil tormentors. These deific beings rule over sahkils as a whole, and many personally direct the actions of their lesser cousins. Others fall into ambivalent routines, focusing more on their own personal acts of torment rather than launching widespread, ambitious depredations upon unsuspecting mortals.

###  War Against Hope

Sahkils and [[Couatl]] are eternal enemies. The creatures each vie for the hearts of mortals, but from different sides of a single ideological coin. Sahkils wish to instill only fear into mortal hearts, trying to reduce them into useless piles of flesh who accomplish little. Couatls work to light the fires of hope, inspiring mortals to rise up and achieve their potential.

###  Xibalba

Within the ghostly realm of the [[Ethereal Plane]], sahkils inhabit a terrifying realm known as Xibalba. The Land of Dread is a realm of nightmares made manifest. At the center of this demiplane is a tiered pyramid known as the Black Pyramid, where the sahkil tormentors rule their brethren and sow fear through the mortal realm.
