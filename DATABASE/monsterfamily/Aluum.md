# Aluum

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 149. Against the Scarlet Triad|Pathfinder #149: Against the Scarlet Triad]]
Aluums are powerful metal and stone constructs originally created by the Pactmasters to maintain order in Katapesh. The construction of each aluum includes the creation of an [[DATABASE/equipment/Aluum Charm|aluum charm]], a brass pendant set with a blue crystal designed to control that particular construct. The charm constructed at the same time as an aluum is called its linked charm.

###  Loyal City Servants

Retired Zephyr Guards are the most common soul donors bound within an aluum’s crystalline focus, typically agreeing to it early in their career in exchange for a higher salary.

###  Rogue Aluums

Although members of the Zephyr Guard stop at nothing to detain and destroy rogue aluums, several such renegade spiritbound aluums remain at large.
 **Daemon of Dogtown**: Following the Silk Riots of 4303 AR, the Pactmasters dispatched this aluum to eliminate straggling instigators. It succeeded, but not before gaining sentience and enacting a 3-day string of murders. Although officials claim it was destroyed, the so-called Daemon of Dogtown’s body was never actually recovered, leading to rumors that it still haunts the outskirts of Katapesh.
 **Queen Halkuar**: Assigned to protect a gnoll emissary from the Spotted Hide pack, this aluum failed to protect its charge from assassins. Instinctively, it bound the gnoll’s soul, assumed the fabricated persona of “Queen Halkuar,” and fled into the hinterlands. The queen is said to still wander the wastes in search of additional “packmates.”
