Fleas are little more than a nuisance in most circumstances, but can be lethal when they grow to monstrous proportions or gather in enormous swarms.

### Members

[[Flea Swarm]] (Creature 5), [[Giant Flea]] (Creature 3)

###  Flea Allies

Flea swarms and giant fleas make for natural pets and monstrous minions for creatures who live in areas of filth and concentrated populations. [[Goblin]] and [[Gremlin]] are unperturbed by fleas' disturbing physiologies and are unfazed (though not necessarily unaffected) by the diseases these vermin carry. [[Ratfolk]] have been known to tame giant fleas for use as mounts, and urban-dwelling [[Druid]] whose magic focuses on blight or disease naturally find much to like about the flea swarms they frequently summon.
