# Flea

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 151. The Show Must Go On|Pathfinder #151: The Show Must Go On]]
Fleas are little more than a nuisance in most circumstances, but can be lethal when they grow to monstrous proportions or gather in enormous swarms.

###  Flea Allies

Flea swarms and giant fleas make for natural pets and monstrous minions for creatures who live in areas of filth and concentrated populations. [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Goblin|Goblins]] and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Gremlin|gremlins]] are unperturbed by fleas' disturbing physiologies and are unfazed (though not necessarily unaffected) by the diseases these vermin carry. [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ratfolk|Ratfolk]] have been known to tame giant fleas for use as mounts, and urban-dwelling [[DATABASE/class_/Druid|druids]] whose magic focuses on blight or disease naturally find much to like about the flea swarms they frequently summon.
