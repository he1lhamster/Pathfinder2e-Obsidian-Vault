# Tooth Fairy

**Source** [[Bestiary 3]]
Tooth fairies spawn when a child's tooth (or, less commonly, an entire child) is buried in terrain rife with fey energies. Hatching from the buried teeth like larvae from an egg, tooth fairies build crude pliers from whatever they can find, then go hunting for more teeth—regardless of the owners' willingness.

###  Folk Traditions

Tooth fairies fear cats and flee from even newborn kittens. The antipathy is mutual, as all cats hunt and kill tooth fairies with relish.
 In some towns, adults leave a small coin under a child's pillow as a bribe for the tooth fairies so that they don't hurt anyone in the house, which sometimes works.
