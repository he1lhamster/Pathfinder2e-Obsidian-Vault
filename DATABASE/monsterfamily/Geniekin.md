# Geniekin

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 2|Bestiary 2]] 
Geniekin are mortals whose ancestry has become entangled with that of [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Genie|genies]], causing them to exhibit elemental powers drawn from the Elemental Planes. Though the geniekin found here are all of human descent and have example alignments, geniekin and other planar scions can descend from other ancestries and have any alignment.

### Common Terminology

The term geniekin came into common parlance mostly thanks to tales from Casmaron and, in particular, the Padishah Empire of Kelesh. Many of these folk stories, songs, and other common tales include great figures who have genie parentage. The prominence and legacy of these stories, along with the fact that the most common geniekin are those with genie ancestors, have cemented “geniekin” as a common term for any individual who manifests elemental traits. This is true even when genies are not part of a person's lineage, such as individuals descended from elementals or sorcerers with the elemental bloodline. Scholars have pushed to use the more accurate descriptor of “elemental scion,” but the term has yet to permeate the common lexicon.

### Elemental Permutations

While other planar scions have lineages that reflect the specific fiends, celestials, or monitors from which their families descend, geniekin lineages are better described as permutations of elemental expression. Elements sometimes manifest in unique and unusual ways within a line of geniekin, regardless of the elemental they descend from. These permutations and their lineages are as follows. 
**Air**: [[DATABASE/feat/Fumesoul|fumesoul]] (miasma sylph), [[DATABASE/feat/Smokesoul|smokesoul]] (haze sylph), [[DATABASE/feat/Stormsoul|stormsoul]] (lightning sylph) 
**Earth**: [[DATABASE/feat/Dustsoul|dustsoul]] (soil oread), [[DATABASE/feat/Gemsoul|gemsoul]] (crystal oread), [[DATABASE/feat/Miresoul|miresoul]] (mud oread) 
**Fire**: [[DATABASE/feat/Brightsoul|brightsoul]] (radiant ifrit), [[DATABASE/feat/Cindersoul|cindersoul]] (ash ifrit), [[DATABASE/feat/Lavasoul|lavasoul]] (magma ifrit) 
**Water**: [[DATABASE/feat/Brinesoul|brinesoul]] (saltwater undine), [[DATABASE/feat/Mistsoul|mistsoul]] (vapor undine), [[DATABASE/feat/Rimesoul|rimesoul]] (frost undine)

###  Geniekin on Golarion

While most geniekin planar scions live on their genie parent's ancestral plane, rare fonts of elemental power or genie activity sometimes give rise to geniekin on Golarion. By far, geniekin are most commonly found in Katapesh, as genies are more prevalent there than other regions due to the influence of genie binders.

###  Geniekin Parentage

Planar scions from the elemental planes are known as geniekin because they are overwhelmingly born from couplings between mortals and genies: [[DATABASE/monster/Ifrit|ifrits]] are born of [[DATABASE/monster/Efreeti|efreeti]], [[DATABASE/monster/Oread|oreads]] of [[DATABASE/monster/Shaitan|shaitans]], [[DATABASE/monster/Suli|sulis]] of [[DATABASE/monster/Janni|jann]], [[DATABASE/monster/Sylph|sylphs]] of [[DATABASE/monster/Djinni|djinn]], and [[DATABASE/monster/Undine|undines]] of [[DATABASE/monster/Marid|marids]]. Despite this distinguished ancestry, geniekin do not display most of their parents' exceptional talents, such as their ability to grant wishes.

###  Other Planar Scions

Two other planar scions are the entropy-infused ganzi and their polar opposites, the orderly aphorites, scions of chaos and law respectively.

## Planar Scion

Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are benevolent and kindly, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons. And some flt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines for generations to follow. After the first generation, this otherworldly influence usually lies dormant, but now and then, the influence can manifest strongly in descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known collectively as planar scions.
