Giant solifugids are monstrous vermin with six legs and two large feeding appendages easily mistaken for an additional pair of legs. They are often called camel spiders, sun spiders, or wind scorpions, despite the fact that they are neither spiders nor scorpions.

###  Solifugid Burrows

Most species of solifugid lay their eggs in burrows. The female doesn't eat while guarding her eggs, and thus fights even more aggressively against any creatures she deems potential threats to her brood. The bodies of wayward adventurers often litter such burrows, though this does little to deter other fortune-hunters from trying their luck in such treasure-laden nests.
