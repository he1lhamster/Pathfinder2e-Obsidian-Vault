Inspired by the work of the Azlanti and their obsessions with [[DATABASE/equipment/Aeon Stone|aeon stones]], certain necromancers strive to tap into those curious magical items to create undead with powerful abilities. A facetbound is created from a living being with an _aeon stone_ surgically attached to their skull who is killed in a specific, secret ritual. Each facetbound must bear a single _aeon stone_, and this stone determines the powers the facetbound wields (in place of the normal powers of the implanted stone).

###  Azlanti Heritage

The creation of a facetbound is difficult for several reasons, not least of which is the cost of the necessary _aeon stones_. Even so, creators sometimes fail even when they replicate the process exactly. Some researchers posit that the most successful cases are those in which the subjects have at least some Azlanti ancestry
