# Fly

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 2|Bestiary 2]] 
Giant flies are pony-sized insects that have massive compound eyes and bodies bristling with short, stiff hairs. Their lairs are notorious for the rotting meat they stockpile to lay their eggs into. Their maggot-dens are also prime breeding grounds for virulent diseases.
