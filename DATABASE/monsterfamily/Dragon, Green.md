# Dragon, Green

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.
 Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.
 Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.
 Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.

While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.

### Shape-Changing Dragons

Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
 **Change Shape** <span class="action-icon">1</span> (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).

### Chromatic Dragon Spellcasters

Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.

### Chromatic Dragons of Golarion

The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.
 Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
