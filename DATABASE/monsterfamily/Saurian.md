**Source** [[Pathfinder 156. The Apocalypse Prophet]]
Enormous tyrannosaurus-humanoids, saurians are ancient beings who predate the rise of humans and dwell in the world's primeval jungles. While the saurians presented here are evil, saurians of all alignments exist.

### Members

[[Saurian Warmonger]] (Creature 16), [[Saurian Worldwatcher]] (Creature 18)

###  Saurian Allies

Saurians' immense physical strength and incredible longevity make them natural stewards of other powerful creatures such as [[Dinosaur]] and [[Mammoth]]. However, they would never call these creatures “domesticated,” a concept they find particularly reprehensible.

###  Saurians on Golarion

Garund, with its warm tropical climes and epic mountain ranges, hosts the largest populations of saurians around the Inner Sea, but explorers claim that southern Arcadia is home to even more. Saurians have also been reported dwelling in vaults throughout the Darklands.
