Beavers are stocky, herbivorous rodents that live in freshwater ecosystems throughout Avistan. They live in lodges, which they construct from logs, grass, rocks, and mud.

###  Nature's Engineers

Beavers change their environments in ways few other animals can: felling trees, altering riverbanks, and building homes and dams that change the surrounding landscape. They widen rivers and streams, flood tributaries to create ponds and small lakes, and create and maintain wetlands. These industrious animal engineers regularly maintain and repair their constructions.
