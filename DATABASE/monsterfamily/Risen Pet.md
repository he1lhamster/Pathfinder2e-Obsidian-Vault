# Risen Pet

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
Bonds of loyalty that endure beyond death reanimate pets to crawl from their graves within days of dying, returning to the side of their past owners, family, or pack. Unfortunately, death irrevocably changes a risen pet. They return as aggressive, predatory beasts, difficult to control and easy to anger. Even the most friendly and docile of pets becomes sadistic and violent in undeath— fixating first on those it views as competition for the attention of its owners. When a risen pet is jilted, rebuffed, or offended by its owner, it turns on them.

###  Lairs and Loot

Risen pets linger near where they were slain or buried. In pet cemeteries, many risen pets might congregate together for ghoulish frolics. Pets buried in a backyard or under the floorboards might dwell in the homes in which they lived their lives, even after their owners are dead and the home crumbles around them into ruin. Within these dilapidated lairs, risen pets hoard the possessions of their owners, both valuable treasure and worthless trinkets with sentimental value.
