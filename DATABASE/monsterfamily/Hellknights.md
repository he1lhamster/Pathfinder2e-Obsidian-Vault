# Hellknights

**Source** [[Character Guide]] 
Several different orders of the mercenaries known collectively as Hellknights operate in Avistan, with most of their number stationed in the nation of Cheliax. These mercenaries see the law of the land as inviolate and offer their services as enforcers to any who can pay their prices. They wear distinctive suits of intimidating armor and take the legends of [[Hell]] as inspiration, but they see no one but themselves as the true arbiters of law.
