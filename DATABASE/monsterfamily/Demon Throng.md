# Demon Throng

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 191. The Destiny War|Pathfinder #191: The Destiny War]]
Demons are legion. Countless examples crowd the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]], many of which have yet to be categorized by mortal scholars. In the Abyss, might very much makes right, and so despite their chaotic nature, weaker demons often gather together to enjoy safety in numbers.

### Members

[[DATABASE/monster/Demonic Rabble|Demonic Rabble]] (Creature 13), [[DATABASE/monster/Wrath Riot|Wrath Riot]] (Creature 16)

###  Other Throngs

Wrath riots form because vrocks have an intrinsic quality of cooperation in their dance of ruin, but other types of demons might form into throngs as well. The more notorious forms of demon throngs found in the various tales and historical records include demonic press gangs of [[DATABASE/monster/Babau (Blood Demon)|babaus]], who abduct hapless victims to serve on nightmarish ships, and firestorms of [[DATABASE/monster/Brimorak (Arson Demon)|brimoraks]], who caper and swoop above eldritch volcanoes.

###  Throng Abilities

Demon throngs are troops. They have the [[DATABASE/monsterability/Troop Defenses|Troop Defenses]], Troop Movement, and [[DATABASE/monsterability/Form Up|Form Up]] abilities. They also have the demonic tide ability, which allows them to occupy the same space as other creatures, which is unusual for troops, and Serenity Vulnerability—a result of the troop's demonic nature.

## Demon

When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the [[DATABASE/plane/Abyss|Abyss]], it can become a deadly fiend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more “specialized” depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Abyss.
