# Werecreature, Wereant

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 174. Shadows of the Ancients|Pathfinder #174: Shadows of the Ancients]]
Insectile werecreatures, such as wereants, only come about in unusual circumstances, such as powerful curses from inhuman gods or transformative magic run amok. Wereants work together with a natural cohesion that's rare in other types of werecreatures. The wereants presented here are more powerful than most wereants, as they've been warped by the forces contained within the _Vesicant Egg_.

A creature might be cursed as a wereant, but lone wereants don't remain on their own for long. Their hive mind calls out to other wereants, and they soon join with others in a psychic communion, working toward goals together. In their human forms, wereants might leave their lives behind to join other secret wereants as a band of traders, a construction crew, an entertainment troupe, or other group that sticks close together. They often keep [[DATABASE/monster/Giant Ant|giant ants]] nearby as pets or guardians.

Werecreatures are humanoids doomed to transform into animals and animal-humanoid hybrids under the light of the full moon. These shapechanging creatures are the result of an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through their own bites. Their ability to lurk unseen in the wilds as well as among people, combined with the contagiousness of their condition, makes werecreatures a perennial cause of panicked suspicion.
