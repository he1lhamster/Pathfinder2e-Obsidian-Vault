**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
Pterosaurs are primitive flying creatures. While many are smaller than a human, the two presented below are quite a bit larger. Each of these creatures could pose a serious threat to a person.
 These flying reptiles can be found in a wide selection of regions, but they tend to soar above warm or temperate climates.

Although not true dinosaurs, pterosaurs are often found in the same regions as dinosaurs and other megafauna, wheeling in the skies above and adding to the general primeval ambiance of these lost worlds.
