# Wolverine

**Source** [[Bestiary 2]] 
Few creatures in the natural world can compare in ferocity to an angry wolverine.

### Members

[[Giant Wolverine]] (Creature 4), [[Wolverine]] (Creature 2)

###  Territorial Beasts

Wolverines are territorial animals and fiercely defend their kills, even from larger predators or when they're outnumbered. They claim wide swaths of forests or frozen tundra as their territory, marking it with a pungent odor that serves as a warning to those who recognize the smell. Wolverines have voracious appetites and tend to aggressively devour their food with reckless abandon.
