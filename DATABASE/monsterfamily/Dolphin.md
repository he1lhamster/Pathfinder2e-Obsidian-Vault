###  Dolphins to the Rescue

Dolphins have a somewhat unusual trait—they often come to the aid of other creatures in distress, such as to save a drowning person or to protect someone from the attack of a shark. Not every monster in this book wants to hurt player characters— consider having a dolphin come to an endangered PC's rescue if the situation merits!
