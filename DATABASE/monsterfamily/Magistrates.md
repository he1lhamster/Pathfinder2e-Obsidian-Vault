# Magistrates

**Source** [[Gamemastery Guide]]
Magistrates are the cogs and gears that keep bureaucracy running, moving the machine along under the inertia of the status quo.

### Members

[[Harbormaster]] (Creature 3), [[Judge]] (Creature -1), [[Tax Collector]] (Creature -1), [[Warden]] (Creature 6)

###  At Your Service

Magistrates can conscript others into service in a variety of positions. 
**[[Harbormaster]]**: [[Bosun]], [[Dockhand]], [[Guard]], [[Ship Captain]]. 
**[[Judge]]**: [[Captain of the Guard]], [[Executioner]], [[Guard]], [[Jailer]] 
**[[Tax Collector]]**: [[Captain of the Guard]], [[Guard]], [[Jailer]], [[Watch Officer]]

###  Delaying Tactics

A magistrate can weaponize the bureaucracy. A [[Judge]] might enforce an archaic law generally ignored yet still on the books. A [[Tax Collector]] could ask for the seal of a lord who is out of the region. The [[Harbormaster]] could require all fees in local coin, fully aware money changers won't be open for days.
