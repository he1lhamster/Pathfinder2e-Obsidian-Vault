# Magistrates

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gamemastery Guide|Gamemastery Guide]]
Magistrates are the cogs and gears that keep bureaucracy running, moving the machine along under the inertia of the status quo.

### Members

[[DATABASE/npc/Harbormaster|Harbormaster]] (Creature 3), [[DATABASE/npc/Judge|Judge]] (Creature -1), [[DATABASE/npc/Tax Collector|Tax Collector]] (Creature -1), [[DATABASE/npc/Warden|Warden]] (Creature 6)

###  At Your Service

Magistrates can conscript others into service in a variety of positions. 
**[[DATABASE/npc/Harbormaster|Harbormaster]]**: [[DATABASE/npc/Bosun|Bosun]], [[DATABASE/npc/Dockhand|dockhand]], [[DATABASE/npc/Guard|guard]], [[DATABASE/npc/Ship Captain|ship captain]]. 
**[[DATABASE/npc/Judge|Judge]]**: [[DATABASE/npc/Captain of the Guard|Captain of the guard]], [[DATABASE/npc/Executioner|executioner]], [[DATABASE/npc/Guard|guard]], [[DATABASE/npc/Jailer|jailer]] 
**[[DATABASE/npc/Tax Collector|Tax Collector]]**: [[DATABASE/npc/Captain of the Guard|Captain of the guard]], [[DATABASE/npc/Guard|guard]], [[DATABASE/npc/Jailer|jailer]], [[DATABASE/npc/Watch Officer|watch officer]]

###  Delaying Tactics

A magistrate can weaponize the bureaucracy. A [[DATABASE/npc/Judge|judge]] might enforce an archaic law generally ignored yet still on the books. A [[DATABASE/npc/Tax Collector|tax collector]] could ask for the seal of a lord who is out of the region. The [[DATABASE/npc/Harbormaster|harbormaster]] could require all fees in local coin, fully aware money changers won't be open for days.
