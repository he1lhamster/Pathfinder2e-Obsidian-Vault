**Source** [[Bestiary]]
Hell hounds are fiendish, extraplanar canines hailing from the pit that can hunt down quarry and breathe supernatural gouts of flame. They are temperamental and quick to aggressive behavior.

On the Material Plane, these fiends are sometimes found in the service of fire-loving monsters such as fire giants or efreet, as well as mortals who seek to tame some of the raw power of Hell. In Cheliax, Hellknights occasionally call upon hell hounds to track down fugitives and traitors.
