# Living Symbol

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
Magic is a complex thing to begin with, and at a certain level of sophistication, the differences between a spell and an autonomous creature become increasingly blurry. Living symbols are constructed creatures of reified and reinforced magic, held together by glyphs, runes, and eldritch formulae.
