# Healers

**Source** [[Gamemastery Guide]]
The world is a dangerous place. Thankfully, there are those who devote their lives to easing the pain and suffering of others.

### Members

[[Apothecary]] (Creature -1), [[Physician]] (Creature -1), [[Plague Doctor]] (Creature 5), [[Surgeon]] (Creature 2)

###  Ailments

Common diseases are located here. These can be treated by most healers, though they may have longer-term physiological impacts. For unusual conditions, like [[Ghoul]] or [[Mummy Guardian]], you might impose penalties on a normal healer attempting to remedy them.
