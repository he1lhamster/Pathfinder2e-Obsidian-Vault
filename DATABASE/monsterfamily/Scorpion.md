# Scorpion

**Source** [[Bestiary]]
Chitinous scourges of deserts, forests, savannas, and badlands, scorpions are deadly arachnids with powerful pincers and a painful sting. Scorpions can be found in nearly every climate, where they hunt their prey with a mixture of patient stealth and raw strength. Most scorpions live in underground burrows, either as lone hunters or part of a larger colony. These arachnids are so feared and dangerous that in many cultures, they are treated as deities or dualistic symbols of both death and protection from said death.

###  Scorpion Venom

While scorpions are often symbols of death or evil, their venom can be extracted and used for a wide variety of medical applications. A character can milk an incapacitated giant scorpion to extract raw scorpion venom, which can be used as raw materials to craft [[Giant Scorpion Venom]] or [[Antiplague]]. To determine the value of ingredients you gain each day and the DC of the appropriate [[Medicine]] or [[Lore]] check, use the level 3 task entry in [[Earn Income]].

###  The Desert Rider

Those rescued from death in the burning sands often recount the same dying vision: a strange, silver-eyed woman whose scarlet silk tents stand on the back of a colossal black scorpion, riding out of a shattered city and leading an army of the dead across a sea of glass toward the world of the living. Millennium-old paintings on the walls of rediscovered tombs depict a similar desert rider. The identity of this red-robed woman is unknown.
