###  Octopus Species

The octopuses presented here are smaller versions of the much larger giant octopus, but other species exist as well. The brightly colored seafire octopus occupies a predatory niche somewhere between the reef octopus and giant octopus—its bite injects a venom that causes a painful rash and nausea. The immense grisly octopus is among the largest of its kind. It can swallow humans whole and can squirt particularly sticky crimson ink to incapacitate prey.
