# Raven

**Source** [[Bestiary 2]] 
Few birds are as cunning and social as the raven.

### Members

[[Raven]] (Creature -1), [[Raven Swarm]] (Creature 3)

###  Raven Traders

Given enough time to develop the relationship and establish what you want, it is possible to engage a raven in a sort of trade. Placing a small, shiny object where the raven can take it might entice it to grab the prize and fly off, returning 3d6 minutes later with something from its own stash. Convincing a raven to trade requires a DC 20 [[Nature]] check to [[Command an Animal]] and, of course, a raven who has the inclination to trade with you in the first place.
