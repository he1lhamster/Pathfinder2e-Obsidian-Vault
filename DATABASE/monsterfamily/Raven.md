###  Raven Traders

Given enough time to develop the relationship and establish what you want, it is possible to engage a raven in a sort of trade. Placing a small, shiny object where the raven can take it might entice it to grab the prize and fly off, returning 3d6 minutes later with something from its own stash. Convincing a raven to trade requires a DC 20 [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] check to [[DATABASE/action/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] and, of course, a raven who has the inclination to trade with you in the first place.
