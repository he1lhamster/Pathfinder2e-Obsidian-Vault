These massive isopods are native to the Abyssal realm of Gluttondark, in the acidic oceans of the realm’s many cavern-worlds. Aukashungis are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane by [[DATABASE/deity/Zevgavizeb|Zevgavizeb]]-worshipping cultists, who favor aukashungis for their mindless obedience and sheer destructive potential.
