# Cobble Mite

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
Cobble mites resemble squarish stones a few inches across with mouths like split geodes. Though indolent and harmless alone, they're dangerous in large groups.

###  Cobble Mite Pets

Characters looking to keep a cobble mite as a pet can usually buy one in many large cities for 1 gp. Those who search for one in the wild must hunt carefully and risk finding enough cobble mites lairing together to form a cobbleswarm. A character with a familiar can choose a cobble mite, which must have the [[DATABASE/familiarability/Burrower|burrower]] familiar ability.
