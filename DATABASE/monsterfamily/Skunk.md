# Skunk

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
With their distinctive black bodies and white stripes or spots, skunks are instantly recognizable to most creatures. Those who catch a full blast of musk rarely decide to trouble a skunk again, as the revolting stench can linger for hours or even days. Removing the odor is difficult, typically requiring the aid of alchemy or magic.

###  Skunk Musk in Alchemy

In a quest to create less lethal bombs, some alchemists have turned to skunks for inspiration. Reputedly, the resulting stink bombs are vastly more powerful than naturally occurring skunk musk. Few adventuring groups, however, encourage their alchemists to deploy such devices.
