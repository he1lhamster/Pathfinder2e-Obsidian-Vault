###  Ikeshti Characteristics

Ikeshtis are reptilian humanoids with a unique evolutionary lifestyle, from the petite ikeshti brood-minders who collectively raise their community's young and the congregants who manage the settlement to the hulking riveners whose tormented exile transforms them into near-mindless, violent juggernauts.
