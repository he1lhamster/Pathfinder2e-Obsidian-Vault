**Source** [[Pathfinder 173. Doorway to the Red Star]]
Ikeshtis are reptilian humanoids native to Akiton's wastelands. Smaller than Golarion's [[Lizardfolk]], ikeshtis organize around distinct societal roles.

### Members

[[Ancient Rivener]] (Creature 14), [[Ikeshti Brood-Minder]] (Creature 2)

###  Ikeshti Characteristics

Ikeshtis are reptilian humanoids with a unique evolutionary lifestyle, from the petite ikeshti brood-minders who collectively raise their community's young and the congregants who manage the settlement to the hulking riveners whose tormented exile transforms them into near-mindless, violent juggernauts.
