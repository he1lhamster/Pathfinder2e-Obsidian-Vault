###  Dead Man's Hand

Decks of cards are a traditional method used to tell a person’s fortune, but legends hold that certain cards or combinations of unfortunate draws can attract the attention of the grim reaper. Specialized fortune-telling decks, such as the Harrow, might not feature the visage of the grim reaper directly, but to the paranoid, death could lurk in any unfortunate hand of cards.

###  Grim Reaper Treasure

The grim reaper keeps no treasure, but sometimes lesser deaths hang on to strange keepsakes from those whom they have slain—especially in cases where a lesser death has set its unholy sight on an extended family or faction.
