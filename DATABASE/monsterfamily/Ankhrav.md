Ankhravs are immense, burrowing, and insectile predators, considered by inhabitants of the rural areas of the world to be an all-too-common plague.

###  Ankhrav Burrows

As if the appearance of a hungry ankhrav in a stretch of farmland isn’t bad enough, it almost always indicates the proximity of an ankhrav hive nearby. A disturbing number of ankhravs can infest a lair. However, adventurers brave enough to crawl through the tangled burrows are often rewarded with large amounts of treasure as ankhravs have a habit of dragging their victims back to the deepest corners of their den to feast, usually discarding the remains with most of the gear intact.
