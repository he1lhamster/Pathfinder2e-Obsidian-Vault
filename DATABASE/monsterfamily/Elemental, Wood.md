# Elemental, Wood

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
At first glance, wood elementals might not seem to have the same destructive potential as their cousins from the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Fire|Planes of Fire]], [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Water|Water]], or [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Air|Air]], but don't be fooled. The woods can be a dangerous place.
 Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.

###  A Brain By Any Other Name

Even if Lady [[DATABASE/deity/Shumunue|Shumunue]] taught the wood elementals' ancestors to mimic animals, a wood elemental's consciousness is contained not in a brain but in its root system. Entities like [[DATABASE/monster/Nursery Crawler|nursery crawlers]], [[DATABASE/monster/Living Grove|living groves]], and [[DATABASE/monster/Carved Beast|carved beasts]] use this to their advantage. That an elemental's wooden body can be carved and crafted, apparently without lasting harm, implies that they might not feel pain so long as their roots remain undamaged.

###  Wild But Unwild

Many wood elementals are created by [[DATABASE/monster/Kizidhar|kizidhar]] and other powerful creatures on the [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Plane of Wood]] and placed in rote roles. Populating nature preserves and sprawling estates, they can be unsure how to behave if released into the wild. They're essentially born domesticated and will likely act far differently than the wild creatures they mimic, even in natural environments. Their natural predators are few, putting the elementals at less risk, although they're still sometimes eaten by giant termites or captured by some as pets.

The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
