# Verdorite

**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
When disaster befalls the natural world, a different kind of undead may rise, entirely unlike risen humanoids. Most plants, fish, insects, and other animals don't possess a psychology complex enough to experience the emotional catharsis required to return as undead without intervention from an outside force.
 Mass extinction can serve as that outside force. Humanoids clear-cutting an entire forest or a seaside community wiping out a species critical to their ecosystem can spawn a verdorite. The collective spiritual energy and emotional distress of a dying biome powers these undead, formed as conglomerates or representatives.

### Members

[[Seetangeist]] (Creature 12), [[Waldgeist]] (Creature 8)

###  Once-Mortal Waldgeists

Sometimes [[Druid]], fey, [[Gnome]], and other powerful primal spellcasters with a deep connection to a specific woodland ritually sacrifice their lives to the forest, intentionally dying so they can rise as a waldgeist and protect their home for all time.
