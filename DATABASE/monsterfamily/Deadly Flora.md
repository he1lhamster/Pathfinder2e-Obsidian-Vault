# Deadly Flora

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/The Fall of Plaguestone|The Fall of Plaguestone]]
Often overlooked in light of more obvious threats, some plants can be just as deadly and dangerous as wild beasts.

### Members

[[DATABASE/monster/Bloodlash Bush|Bloodlash Bush]] (Creature 2), [[DATABASE/monster/Vine Lasher|Vine Lasher]] (Creature 0)

###  Locations

These deadly organisms can be found in any hot or temperate environment, but like most plants, they need light and moisture to thrive.

###  Treasure

While most forms of deadly flora do not value treasure in any way, their victims' wealth can usually be found strewn about their location, sometimes even buried in their roots. Due to the outdoors, the only things of value that are typically found are made from metal or stone, like weapons, armor, and some talismans.
