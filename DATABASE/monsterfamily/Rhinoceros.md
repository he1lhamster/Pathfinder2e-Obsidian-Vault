# Rhinoceros

**Source** [[Bestiary 2]] 
This hefty animal is easily recognizable by the distinctive upward-thrusting horn on its snout. Rhinoceroses are herbivorous and, in spite of their hulking size, can run at considerable speed. While rhinos have good hearing and a keen sense of smell, their eyesight is relatively poor.

###  Rhinoceros Horns

While some species have only a single horn, many rhinos, including woolly rhinos, have a second, smaller horn on their brow directly behind the larger one. Despite their appearance and durability, rhino horns aren't bone or ivory, but rather are composed of the same substance as hooves and toenails. A rhino's horn continues to grow as it ages, enabling a rhino to slowly regrow a broken horn. While some value rhino horns as trophies, the horns themselves have no intrinsic value.
