Many varieties of jellyfish drift through the world’s oceans, feeding on fish and other tiny marine creatures. However, deadly species of monstrous jellyfish pose a threat to unwary swimmers and sailors alike. Note that while jellyfish are animals, they also have the mindless trait because they lack a centralized nervous system.
