# Rat

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
Rats are a ubiquitous menace, scurrying through the sewers and on the streets of nearly every settlement the world over. Though a regular rat darting underfoot might startle or even frighten the average passerby, giant rats and rat swarms are far more dangerous.

###  Rats and Disease

Rats have a reputation of being vicious, aggressive animals that attack food stores in great numbers and spread disease. While rats are immune to the most severe effects of their own filth fever, the disease makes them unpredictable and aggressive. Some populations of rats carry even more deadly diseases, such as [[DATABASE/disease/Bubonic Plague|bubonic plague]].
