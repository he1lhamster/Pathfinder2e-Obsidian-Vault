# Lamia

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
Lamias are bloodthirsty victims of an ancient curse for which they blame the gods. Most lamias are humanoid from the waist up but have the lower bodies of beasts and monsters. Sinister magic comes naturally to a lamia, and they prefer the use of illusions and enchantments to deceive prey for later consumption, or simply to torture.

###  Lamia Location

Lamias dwell on the edge of civilization in crumbling keeps, abandoned cities, and the fallen temples of forgotten gods.

###  Lamia Treasure

Lamias salvage gold, jewels, and magic items from the abandoned temples and ruined cities where they make their lairs. They sometimes arm themselves with enchanted daggers.

###  Other Lamias

Adventurers report encounters with other varieties of lamia, including immense versions with the upper torsos of giants, monstrosities driven by insatiable hunger, or flying buzzard-like beasts with hardly any humanoid features, yet all of these variants bow to the wisdom and influence of the lamia matriarchs.
