# Gibtas

**Source** [[Pathfinder 164. Hands of the Devil]]
This rubbery, spheroid scavenger is nearly all acid-dripping mouth, with five bulbous black eyes and two powerful, gangly legs. A gibtas often forms a bond with a single other creature—usually, a more powerful aberration— and serves this master loyally, if erratically. Creatures who keep a gibtas as a pet or guard soon learn to keep it away from any important possessions they don't want spattered with acid.

### Members

[[Gibtanius]] (Creature 8), [[Gibtas Bounder]] (Creature 5), [[Gibtas Spawn Swarm]] (Creature 6)

###  Gibtas Companions

A gibtas can make for an unusual animal companion, with the GM's permission. Use the statistics for a [[Badger]], except the companion has the rare trait, is an aberration rather than an animal, has [[Darkvision]] rather than [[Low-Light Vision]], and gains the [[Gibtas Bounder]] Bouncing Slam as an advanced maneuver instead of [[Bear Hug]].

###  Wild Gibtases

In the wild, gibtases are scavenger creatures, avoiding much larger and more powerful predators while feeding off abandoned scraps. This limits their consumption-based reproduction. By spawning hundreds of offspring at once during times of plentiful food, they ensure the propagation of their species only during times of plenty.
