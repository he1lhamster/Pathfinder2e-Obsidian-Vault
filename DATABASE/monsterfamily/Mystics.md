# Mystics

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Gamemastery Guide|Gamemastery Guide]]
Those initiated into the hidden truths and forbidden secrets of the world are forever transformed—or so they claim. To the cynical, a mystic is nothing more than a charlatan or zealot. Others profess to sense an aura around such luminaries and treat them with reverence, lest they offend some harbinger of unspeakable doom.

### Members

[[DATABASE/npc/Adept|Adept]] (Creature -1), [[DATABASE/npc/Cult Leader|Cult Leader]] (Creature 7), [[DATABASE/npc/Cultist|Cultist]] (Creature 1), [[DATABASE/npc/Demonologist|Demonologist]] (Creature 7), [[DATABASE/npc/False Priest|False Priest]] (Creature 4), [[DATABASE/npc/Harrow Reader|Harrow Reader]] (Creature -1), [[DATABASE/npc/Necromancer|Necromancer]] (Creature 5)

###  Dark Rituals

Most rituals have a simple gp cost and skills. But what if a desperate NPC is willing to offer something darker, such as lives, souls, or worse? Such a nefarious ritual uses a normal ritual as a baseline, but the DCs and proficiency requirements might be reduced or waived entirely, as might any gp cost.

###  Forms Of Fortune-Telling

**Anthomancy**: Flowers. 
**Astrology**: The cosmic caravan. 
**Demonomancy**: Asking demons. 
**Harrowing**: Harrow card readings. 
**Haruspicy**: Entrails. 
**Ichthyomancy**: The next fish caught.

###  Mystic Cadres

Golarion has several mystic groups. **The Church of Razmir** offers a plan of 31 steps to divinity. The **Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye** seeks celestial truths said to be granted by an ancient angel. **Knights of the Aeon Star** search for secret lore. Followers of **Rivethun**, dwarven animism, reach out to spirits to gain knowledge and earn favors.
