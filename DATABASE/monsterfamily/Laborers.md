# Laborers

**Source** [[Gamemastery Guide]]
Every day, laborers perform backbreaking physical work.

### Members

[[Dockhand]] (Creature 0), [[Farmer]] (Creature 0), [[Gravedigger]] (Creature 1), [[Miner]] (Creature 0), [[Servant]] (Creature -1)

###  Forced Labor

Many creatures and societies still practice forced labor, whether through full enslavement or indebted labor to pay a society for their crimes. The [[Dockhand]], [[Farmer]], [[Miner]], and [[Servant]] could also be forced laborers. Forced laborers could become allies or at least informants to PCs who free them.

###  Laborer Games

Laborers tend to play games when the work is slow or while on break. Common games include Gremlin Row, which involves rolling dice and trying to match them, as well as Fishing with Fire, in which players try to get all the cards of one type from a deck without losing all of their own cards and getting “burned.”
