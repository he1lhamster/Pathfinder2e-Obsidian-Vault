# Blightburn Genies

**Source** [[Pathfinder 155. Lord of the Black Sands]]
Before the Black Desert became a barren sandscape, cultures with grand magical traditions lived under its soaring roof. These communities eventually left the vault or died out, but the [[Genie]] they summoned remained and became warped by the region's pervasive blightburn radiation. Now, these “blightburn genies” have bodies with features mirroring those of beasts that dwell in dark places, and their elemental lineages have been irreparably corrupted.

### Members

[[Ararda]] (Creature 18), [[Muurfeli]] (Creature 16)

###  Elemental Fusions

Genies of the Black Desert do not personify the four elements of the Elemental Planes as they do elsewhere in the cosmos. Rather, blightburn genies combine their innate elemental powers with the features of the desert to summon powerful, perverted versions of natural phenomena such as electric sandstorms or acid rain.

###  Other Blightburn Genies

In addition to [[Muurfeli]] and [[Ararda]], other blightburn genies can also be found in the Black Desert, including black, doglike [[Efreeti]] called suayiks and laanums, amorphous [[Marid]]-like horrors with the heads of powerful sea serpents. Darklands equivalent of [[Janni]] may exist, though they supposedly only appear to the hopelessly lost.
