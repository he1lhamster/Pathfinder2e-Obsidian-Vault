# Brughadatch

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 154. Siege of the Dinosaurs|Pathfinder #154: Siege of the Dinosaurs]]
Brughadatches are malevolent fey tricksters with distinct stages of life: they spawn from the First World’s primal energies as esurient tadpoles, grow into humanoids capable of creating enticing illusions, then finally evolve into huge, slothful toads that warp their environs with mere thoughts.

###  Strength in Numbers

Brughadatches of all life stages tend to cohabitate, since their abilities naturally synergize and tip the odds of survival in their favor. A single brughadatch elder—known as a doblagub—leads a clan, while midlife brughadatches serve as scouts, hunters, and laborers. Gahlepods dwell in large, stagnant ponds and bogs around the brughadatches’ holdings, so they are often the first to interact with creatures that carelessly wander into their domain. Adventurers who make it past these bogs often fail to realize the connection between the gahlepods and the amphibious tricksters further on in the swamp until they encounter the doblagub, who is now roused and commands their brethren in battle.
