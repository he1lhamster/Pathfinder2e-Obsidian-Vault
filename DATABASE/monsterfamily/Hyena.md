# Hyena

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
Hyenas are pack-hunting scavengers known for their unnerving, laughter-like cries, and they aren’t above supplementing their carrion diets with fresh prey.

###  Hyena Legends

The hyena’s intense cunning, combined with its unnerving laughter, has caused hyenas to become associated with all manner of evil—hyenas are claimed to rob graves, steal children, and wield sinister supernatural powers. Though normal hyenas are no more malicious than any other natural predator, their unearned reputation often causes witches, warlords, and ill-natured creatures to seek out hyenas as pets or guard animals. The fact that gnolls in particular have a special preference for hyenas, considering the animals to be close relatives, does little to improve the animal’s already-poor reputation.
