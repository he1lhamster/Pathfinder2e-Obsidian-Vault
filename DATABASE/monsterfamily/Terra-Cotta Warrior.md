# Terra-Cotta Warrior

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
Terra-cotta warriors guard the tombs of ancient rulers, where they stand vigil, animating only when intruders break in to pilfer riches or defile the tomb itself. Each warrior is meticulously crafted from clay and given unique features.

###  Runic Impressions

At its creation, a terra-cotta warrior can be engraved with runes as if it were a weapon with an item level equal to its creature level, applying these runes to the weapons it wields. Such runes can't be removed and engraved on items. The soldier here has only a [[DATABASE/equipment/Weapon Potency|+1 weapon potency]] rune and a [[DATABASE/equipment/Striking|striking]] rune, but more powerful versions with more powerful potency and property runes have been known to exist.
