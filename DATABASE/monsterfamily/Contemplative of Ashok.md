# Contemplative of Ashok

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 173. Doorway to the Red Star|Pathfinder #173: Doorway to the Red Star]]
The ancestors of the Contemplatives of Ashok were humanoids of vast intellect who unlocked occult powers. They deliberately evolved their mental faculties at the expense of their physical forms, and their atrophied bodies dangle beneath giant brains.

###  Ashok

Ashok refers both to an ancient impact crater on Akiton and the state of enlightenment the contemplatives seek to achieve. The exact relation between the crater and this philosophy is unclear, but evidence suggests that the crater's location could possibly be the contemplatives' long-lost ancestral homeland.

###  Disciples of Time

Contemplative meditants and mentors alike are obsessed with the complexities of time, but not in a way that seeks to abuse the knowledge to change the past. Instead, these contemplatives believe that pure thought can be achieved by ascending beyond the physical dimensions into beings composed of time itself. The existence of physical entities from the [[DATABASE/plane/Dimension of Time|Dimension of Time]], such as [[DATABASE/monster/Hound of Tindalos|hounds of Tindalos]] and [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Siktempora|siktemporas]], constitutes a vexing paradox to these philosophies. Contemplatives find such creatures to be unpleasant at best and truly abhorrent at worst.
