**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 171. Hurricane's Howl|Pathfinder #171: Hurricane's Howl]]
Karumzeks are crafty, spider-like servitors of [[DATABASE/deity/Norgorber|Norgorber]].

### Members

[[DATABASE/monster/Karumzek|Karumzek]] (Creature 4), [[DATABASE/monster/Karumzek Swarm|Karumzek Swarm]] (Creature 11)

###  Traveling from Axis

Karumzeks remain in Duskfathom, awaiting orders from Norgorber. Once a karumzek receives its orders, it begins its journey from [[DATABASE/plane/Axis|Axis]] to elsewhere in the Great Beyond via a secret system of planar strands known as the “Reaper's Web.” While not instantaneous, a karumzek traveling along the web can reach almost any point in the Great Beyond within a few hours.
