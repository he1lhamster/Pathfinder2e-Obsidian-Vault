# Karumzek

**Source** [[Pathfinder 171. Hurricane's Howl]]
Karumzeks are crafty, spider-like servitors of [[Norgorber]].

### Members

[[Karumzek]] (Creature 4), [[Karumzek Swarm]] (Creature 11)

###  Traveling from Axis

Karumzeks remain in Duskfathom, awaiting orders from Norgorber. Once a karumzek receives its orders, it begins its journey from [[Axis]] to elsewhere in the Great Beyond via a secret system of planar strands known as the “Reaper's Web.” While not instantaneous, a karumzek traveling along the web can reach almost any point in the Great Beyond within a few hours.
