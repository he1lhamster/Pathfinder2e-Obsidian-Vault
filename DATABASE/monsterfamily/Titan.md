# Titan

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
Created by ancient deities long before the rise of mortal ancestries, titans united and attempted to overthrow their deific progenitors. The resulting war still figures prominently throughout mortal myths, in which most titans were cast down and imprisoned for eons.
