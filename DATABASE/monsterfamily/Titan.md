# Titan

**Source** [[Bestiary 3]]
Created by ancient deities long before the rise of mortal ancestries, titans united and attempted to overthrow their deific progenitors. The resulting war still figures prominently throughout mortal myths, in which most titans were cast down and imprisoned for eons.

### Members

[[Danava Titan]] (Creature 23), [[Elysian Titan]] (Creature 21), [[Hekatonkheires Titan]] (Creature 24), [[Thanatotic Titan]] (Creature 22)

###  Other Titans

Titans vary widely, depending on what function the deities intended them to serve or their methods of waging war. They include inflexible [[Danava Titan]], warmongering [[Hekatonkheires Titan]], armored fomorian titans, shapeshifting sashenji titans, and cunning citevi titans.

###  Titan Weapons

Some titans carry a fabled [[Mattock of the Titans]]. Good titans use it to build, while evil titans use it to destroy. Similar weapons include the _felling axe of the titans_, a [[Greataxe]] that can be whirled to create a [[Punishing Winds]] effect.
