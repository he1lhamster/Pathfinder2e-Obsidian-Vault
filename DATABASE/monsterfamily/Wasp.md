# Wasp

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary|Bestiary]]
While the common wasp poses little threat to a hardy adventurer aside from an uncomfortable sting, a large and aggressive swarm of these territorial insects—to say nothing of their oversized kin—can lay low an entire party of heroes. The wasps represented here are of the common variety also known as yellowjackets, but many other sorts of dangerous wasps exist, such as a Garundi variant that swarms in such great numbers that it can decimate entire villages, and the dreaded extraplanar hellwasps, which build their nests within the corpses of their victims.

###  Paralytic Poison

The poison of the giant wasp loses its potency soon after being harvested, but alchemists have learned of a way to preserve some of its properties by adding a number of harsh additives; this method makes it even deadlier.

###  Sacred Stingers

Wasps are upheld as sacred among the priesthood of the elven deity Calistria, goddess of vengeance. Some priests of Calistria summon giant wasps or wasp swarms as servitors, while a few nurture giant wasps as pets, temple guardians, or companions. Followers of Calistria, both clergy and laypeople alike, seek to emulate the wasp’s penchant for leaving stung victims alive to suffer over a long period: a fitting model for revenge.
