# Giant

**Source** [[Bestiary]]
Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout the world. They are divided into a number of subtypes.

### Members

[[Cave Giant]] (Creature 6), [[Cloud Giant]] (Creature 11), [[Desert Giant]] (Creature 9), [[Fire Giant]] (Creature 10), [[Frost Giant]] (Creature 9), [[Hill Giant]] (Creature 7), [[Marsh Giant]] (Creature 8), [[Plague Giant]] (Creature 14), [[Rune Giant]] (Creature 16), [[Shadow Giant]] (Creature 13), [[Giant, Smog]] (Creature 7), [[Stone Giant]] (Creature 8), [[Storm Giant]] (Creature 13), [[Taiga Giant]] (Creature 12), [[Tomb Giant]] (Creature 12), [[Wood Giant]] (Creature 6)

###  Giant Bags

Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.

###  Giant Locations

As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.

###  Giant Pets

As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.

###  Other Giants

Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.

###  Oversized Themes

Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.
