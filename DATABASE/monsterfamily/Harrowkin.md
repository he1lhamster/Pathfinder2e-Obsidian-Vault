###  Ancient Harrowkin

Some harrowkin form from ancient decks, even originating from the days before Earthfall. These harrowkin are especially powerful as they've spent a long time—sometimes millennia—learning to control their own abilities and their magical influence over the power of fate. These harrowkin are known to keep weaker harrowkin as companions or servants, living secluded lives in their own courts of fate. Unlike other harrowkin, ancient harrowkin have souls, agency, free will, and can be of any alignment.

###  Harrowkin Agency

Harrowkin lack free will, despite being sapient. All are neutral, even in the case of fabled harrowkin whose legacies force them into specific roles. They do not possess souls. When slain they revert back to the card from which they sprang.
