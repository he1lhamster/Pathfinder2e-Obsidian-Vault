# Ray

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 2|Bestiary 2]] 
Rays are an unusual type of fish with wide, sail-like fins and long tails, giving them an almost kite-like shape as they swim gracefully through the water. All rays have a rudimentary form of electrolocation, allowing them to detect the faint electrical charges that emanate naturally from nearby living creatures, a sense akin to scent in its accuracy.

###  Other Rays

Stingrays and manta rays are among the most common species of these fish, but others dwell in more remote areas. The dangerous blood ray is an ambush predator that dwells in murky swamp waters and drains creature's blood after paralyzing them with its sting, while the immense leviathan ray is a deep-ocean predator that has a deadly mouth capable of swallowing small ships whole.
