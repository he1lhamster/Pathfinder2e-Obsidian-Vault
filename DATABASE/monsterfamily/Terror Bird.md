# Terror Bird

**Source** [[Bestiary 3]]
Terror birds aren't one species but rather a family of deadly, flightless avian predators. All terror birds are capable of bursts of great speed and have powerful beaks that can tear apart the flesh of their prey. Most stalk large, open prairies and steppes, competing directly with other sizable predators such as large cats and wolves.
