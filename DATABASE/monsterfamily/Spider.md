###  Associated Monsters

Though they are vermin incapable of forming true alliances, spiders show up alongside many types of creatures, including [[Web Lurker]]. Spellcasters sometimes call upon spiders using summon animal, and spider swarms have a way of popping up just about anywhere at the most inopportune times.

A staggering number of species of giant spider exist in the world. Some, like the dream spider, whose venom creates strange hallucinations, are relatively small. Others, like the lumbering ogre spider, are larger than horses.
