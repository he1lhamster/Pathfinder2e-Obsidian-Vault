# Sloth

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
Despite their long, hooked claws being one of their most distinctive features, sloths are herbivorous creatures. Smaller sloths use their claws to climb from tree to tree, seeking fruits and young leaves among the canopy. Larger species can reach up to 20 feet tall and weigh more than 10,000 pounds.

###  Sloths, Moths, and Moss

Sloths tend to gain a green tinge to their fur as they age, a result of a peculiar strain of mossy algae that grows only on these arboreal creatures. This algae, in turn, feeds a unique species of moth that also makes its home exclusively in sloths' fur—along with other parasites, such as beetles and cockroaches.
