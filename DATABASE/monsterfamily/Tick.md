# Tick

**Source** [[Bestiary 2]] 
These blood-sucking parasites are common vectors for disease and other infections. Ticks infest all parts of the world, save for the most remote and frigid locales, and have evolved to feed on just about every kind of creature.

### Members

[[Giant Tick]] (Creature 1), [[Tick Swarm]] (Creature 9)

###  Tick Diseases

Giant ticks and tick swarms can potentially inflict diseases other than tick fever. Potential diseases that a tick could spread include [[Blinding Sickness]], [[Bubonic Plague]], [[Malaria]], or [[Scarlet Fever]]. The saving throw DC should be adjusted to DC 17 (for giant ticks) or DC 27 (for tick swarms).
