###  That Bloody Hat

Even when a redcap isn't taking persistent bleed damage, their red caps drip crimson, soaked in the blood of their enemies. This is more than enough to provoke creatures who react strongly to the scent of blood. Creatures with scent treat a redcap as a creature taking persistent bleed damage.
