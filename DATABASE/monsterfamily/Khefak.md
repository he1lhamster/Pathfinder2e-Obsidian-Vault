# Khefak

**Source** [[Pathfinder 173. Doorway to the Red Star]]
This unusual arthropod resembles an amalgam of a centipede and a crab. Hard-shelled and perfectly suited to life on Akiton, khefaks are so incredibly useful that a visitor to the planet might assume they were custom engineered for their environs. Such visitors would, in fact, be correct. While khefaks can be found naturally on Akiton, a new species has recently gained a foothold on the planet: alchemically engineered khefaks who excrete a refined substance that can be used as fuel to power advanced engines and devices.
