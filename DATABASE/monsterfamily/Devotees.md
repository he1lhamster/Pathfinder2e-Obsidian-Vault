# Devotees

**Source** [[Gamemastery Guide]]
Religions inspire devout individuals to uphold their tenets. Many of these devotees seek to bring respite and hope, but others have darker motives.

### Members

[[Acolyte]] (Creature 1), [[Priest]] (Creature 6), [[Prophet]] (Creature 2), [[Zealot]] (Creature 4)

###  Spell Swap Example

To make a NE [[Acolyte]] or [[Priest]] of [[Urgathoa]], you can use these spells. **3rd** [[Bind Undead]], [[Circle of Protection]], [[Harm]] (×3), [[Vampiric Touch]]; **2nd** [[Dispel Magic]], [[False Life]], [[Ghoulish Cravings]]; **1st** [[Bane]], [[Fear]], [[Ray of Enfeeblement]]; **Cantrips** [[Chill Touch]], [[Detect Magic]], [[Divine Lance]], [[Guidance]], [[Shield]]; **Cleric Domain Spell** [[Undeath's Blessing]]

###  Swapping Deities

Customize an [[Acolyte]] or [[Priest]] by matching their deity's alignment and favored weapon, adding the deity's divine skill at +14 (or +7), and swapping spells. An example appears on the facing page. (An acolyte gains only the 1st-level spells, domain spell, and cantrips, and has two 1st-level [[Heal]] spells instead of three 3rd-level heal spells.) If you swap [[Harm]] spells for heal, replace [[Healing Hands]] with the [[Selective Energy]] cleric feat.
