###  Sacred Insects

Deadly mantises are sacrosanct to followers of Achaekek, the Mantis God. His adherents, including the infamous Red Mantis assassins, invite or lure deadly mantises close to their settlements, seeing the towering creatures as a sign of their god’s favor. Achaekek’s followers offer sacrifices of livestock or captured enemies to keep the massive insects well fed. Clerics of Achaekek defend a deadly mantis’s territory as if it were their own, believing it to be holy ground.
