# Leech

**Source** [[Bestiary 2]] 
Though valued by apothecaries and field medics as methods to reduce swelling or drain blood, leeches are despised by most who encounter them, regardless of the setting.

### Members

[[Brood Leech Swarm]] (Creature 4), [[Giant Leech]] (Creature 2)

###  Leech Species

The spotted hooktooth leech is often found in areas frequented by trolls, who sometimes wear them as awful decorations, relying on their regeneration to control the bleeding effects. The gigantic elephant leech feeds on immense beasts of the swamplands or jungles, like [[Ant]], [[Froghemoth]], and [[Dinosaur]], attacking from unexpected range. But it's the relatively small gutleech that provides the most fuel for nightmares, due to its awful habit of feeding on victims from inside.
