# Seugathi

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 164. Hands of the Devil|Pathfinder #164: Hands of the Devil]]
The wicked, alien [[DATABASE/monster/Neothelid|neothelids]] impregnate themselves through ritualistic magic to produce wormlike servitor creatures called seugathis. These creatures spawn with a strong psychic drive to complete some task on behalf of the neothelids' far-reaching plans. These directives are diverse, strange, and usually cruel toward humanoid life.

###  Seugathi Obsessions

Because of their singlemindedness, seugathis often come across as eerily obsessive. These obsessions can include corralling 100 [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Dero|deros]] into a cave, collecting skulls of a certain shape, or even more unusual tasks that either have no apparent result or are harmful to the seugathi themself. A seugathi that completes their mission nearly always finds another to replace it buried in its psyche, creating a centuries-long chain of inscrutable—and sometimes even contradictory—commands.

###  Unusual Equipment

Most seugathi carry a magic wand— either one gifted by their neothelid master to serve a particular end or simply one they've discovered to be particularly useful. A _wand of 2nd-level [[DATABASE/spell/Magic Missile|magic missile]]_ is common, but specific equipment is as varied as the seugathis' inexplicable missions. A seugathi might instead carry alchemical equipment, a strange tool, or another magic item. One is just as likely to have a [[DATABASE/equipment/Traveler's Any-Tool|traveler's anytool]] as a jar full of eerie, unstable explosives.
