###  Bear Resources

A bear den can contain valuable treasures, such as the remains of less fortunate adventurers who stumbled into a hungry bear’s path. Bear furs themselves are valued as rugs, while their claws and fangs make for impressive jewelry or adornments for armor. Bear hide is an excellent resource for hide armor.
