# Trilobite

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Bestiary 3|Bestiary 3]]
Often overlooked as little more than water-dwelling pests, trilobites are a varied species of arthropods found throughout the seas and oceans of Golarion. So ancient and widespread are these critters that trilobite fossils are as commonly found as living specimens.

###  Tremendous Variety

Scholars of the sea have identified thousands of varieties of trilobites, each distinguished by appearance, habitat, size, and diet. The smallest trilobites are an inch or two long, while individuals measuring almost two feet long have been found in the depths of the ocean. Some hide in silt, using tall eyestalks to spot prey, while others have wide, sweeping, wing-like heads; certain kinds are even covered in spines. This variety in appearance has led to distinctive jewelry in seaside villages that imitates local trilobite populations.
