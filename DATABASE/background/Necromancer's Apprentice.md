# Necromancer's Apprentice<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
You apprenticed under a necromancer—a hard education in a field where a cadaver you were dissecting could suddenly animate and every magical artifact seemed deadly. Now on your own, you're grateful you learned to identify magical threats quickly and thoroughly.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Necromancy Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Quick Identification|Quick Identification]] skill feat.
