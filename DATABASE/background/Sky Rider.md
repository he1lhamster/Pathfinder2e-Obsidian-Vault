**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
The freedom of a bird in flight is something to envy, and envy it you did, but not for long. You've borrowed mechanical gliders or sought out the benefits of magically aided gliding and flight, doing anything for an opportunity to look down on the world with only the wind to keep you aloft. The expense of these experiences may have been a notable factor in why you undertook the adventuring lifestyle or perhaps you are seeking new methods of flight to master.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Acrobatics]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Cat Fall]] skill feat.
