You held a role of servitude, waiting on nobles and engendering their trust as one of the confidantes of the household. You might have walked away on good terms, or perhaps you know dangerous secrets about your former masters. Regardless, you’re adventuring for a change and finding that in this new role, the skills you’ve learned now serve you.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Labor Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Read Lips|Read Lips]] skill feat.
