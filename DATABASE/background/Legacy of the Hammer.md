Your introduction to the criminal life was spurred forward by a seemingly innocuous hammer that provided you with all kinds of innovative criminal ideas. It has since left your possession, but every now and then you hear a faint whisper urging you toward crime.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Engineering Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Concealing Legerdemain|Concealing Legerdemain]] skill feat.
