Staying alive among the scheming, ravenous undead of Geb required a deep knowledge of their motivations, capabilities, and weaknesses. More often than not, it also required the ability to weave alibis and life-preserving half-truths capable of swaying a stilled heart.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Deception]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Charming Liar]] skill feat.
