**Source** [[Firebrands]]
You once survived a life-or-death situation and found it surprisingly exhilarating, so now you chase that feeling of invincibility you only get when dancing with death. Your desire for exhilaration has you scaling buildings, leaping off rooftops, jumping chasms, and performing other death-defying stunts.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Athletics]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Combat Climber]] skill feat.
