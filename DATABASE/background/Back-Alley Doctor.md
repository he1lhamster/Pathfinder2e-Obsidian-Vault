# Back-Alley Doctor<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
You're the medic many turn to when a more official clinic or healer might not be available. You may specialize in stitching up bullet wounds or have a standing, confidential deal with a criminal syndicate to provide your services any time of day or night. In either case, you've perhaps turned to the adventuring life because a former client is unhappy with your work or members of the local constabulary have been asking too many questions.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Medicine]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Risky Surgery]] skill feat.
