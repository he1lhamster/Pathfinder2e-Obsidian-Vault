**Source** [[DATABASE/source/World Guide|World Guide]] 
**Region** Impossible Lands
Your initiations into the Nexian mysteries and the philosophies of the Arclords of Nex grant you a preternatural comprehension of the arcane underpinnings of existence.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] skill, and a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill related to one plane of your choice (other than the [[DATABASE/plane/Material Plane|material plane]]). You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Arcane Sense|Arcane Sense]] skill feat.
