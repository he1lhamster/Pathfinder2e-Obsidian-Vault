# Nexian Mystic<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Impossible Lands
Your initiations into the Nexian mysteries and the philosophies of the Arclords of Nex grant you a preternatural comprehension of the arcane underpinnings of existence.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Arcana]] skill, and a [[Lore]] skill related to one plane of your choice (other than the [[Material Plane]]). You gain the [[Arcane Sense]] skill feat.
