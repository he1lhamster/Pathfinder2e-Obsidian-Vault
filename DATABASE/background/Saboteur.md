**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
Whether you do it for personal enjoyment or at the behest of a mercenary company or military organization, you have a knack for destroying things. You have a sense for an object or structure's weak spots and know where to deliver a hammer strike or alchemical bomb. You adventure to hone your skills or complete a particular mission.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Thievery]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Concealing Legerdemain]] skill feat.
