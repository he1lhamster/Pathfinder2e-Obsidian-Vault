# Wandering Preacher<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Guns & Gears|Guns & Gears]]
While you once spoke to a small congregation in a ramshackle church, those days are behind you now. Your church was destroyed, your congregants scattered, and now you meander the lands holding a worn copy of your religious text in one hand, and a fiery conviction in the other.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] skill, and a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill associated with the deity you preach for (such as [[DATABASE/deity/Pharasma|Pharasmin]] Lore). You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Pilgrim's Token|Pilgrim's Token]] skill feat.
