**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
As an apprentice, you practiced a particular form of building or crafting, developing specialized skill. You might have been a blacksmith’s apprentice toiling over the forge for countless hours, a young tailor sewing garments of all kinds, or a shipwright shaping the hulls of ships.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Crafting]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Specialty Crafting]] skill feat.
