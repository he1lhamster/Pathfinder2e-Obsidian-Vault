You're adept at calming, wrangling, and living beside woolly mammoths and other megafauna commonly found in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Perhaps you've even formed a particularly strong bond with one or two of your following's animals, and you tend to get along with other herders in the following, such as young Imek or old Chultei. When the Broken Tusk following must move, you and the other herders know how to convey this message to the animals in your herd.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Nature]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Train Animal]] skill feat.
