# Senghor Sailor<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Mwangi Expanse
As an experienced sailor from Senghor, you know that the only thing saving you from disaster on the high seas is a properly maintained ship. You know boat-building inside and out and you can quickly cobble together a solution in the event that something breaks.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Crafting]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Quick Repair]] skill feat.
