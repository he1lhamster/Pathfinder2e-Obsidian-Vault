**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Broken Lands
You serve a living god who rules upon the face of Golarion, and this gives your actions a divine mandate not to be trifled with.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Intimidation]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Group Coercion]] skill feat.
