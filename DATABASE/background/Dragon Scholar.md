# Dragon Scholar<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[Age of Ashes Player's Guide]]
Dragons have fascinated you for as long as you can remember. The potent power they possess, the long lives they lead, the ancient traditions they inspire—whatever the source of your interest, you’ve spent much of your life to this point immersed in all things draconic. These studies have bolstered your self-confidence and given you a wide range of methods and tactics you can use to impose your will on others.
 You’ve likely chosen to attend the Call for Heroes as a way to seek funds as an adventurer to afford more texts about dragons or perhaps out of a desire to encounter one in real life.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Intimidation]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
