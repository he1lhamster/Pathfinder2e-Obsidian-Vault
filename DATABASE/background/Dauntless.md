As a child, you chose to face each of your deepest fears and, time and again, emerged victorious. You have learned to conquer fear itself, and by sheer force of will and determination, you're able to brush off frightening experiences more easily than most. Others find it difficult to intimidate you into backing down from whatever you've set your mind to.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You are trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill. You gain the Indomitable Act reaction.
 **Indomitable Act** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You are about to attempt a check; **Requirements** You are [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened]]; **Effect** You lean into your fear, using it to embolden you. You can roll the triggering check twice and take the higher result. This is a fortune effect.
