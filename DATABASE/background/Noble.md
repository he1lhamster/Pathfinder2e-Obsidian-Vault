**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
To the common folk, the life of a noble seems one of idyllic luxury, but growing up as a noble or member of the aspiring gentry, you know the reality: a noble’s lot is obligation and intrigue. Whether you seek to escape your duties by adventuring or to better your station, you have traded silks and pageantry for an adventurer’s life.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Genealogy Lore]] skill or Heraldry Lore skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Courtly Graces|Courtly Graces]] skill feat.
