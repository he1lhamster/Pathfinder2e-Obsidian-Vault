# Student of Magic<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
You are currently enrolled at a school of magic, where you're learning the fundamentals of your magical tradition. Whether your adventuring occurs during breaks between semesters, as part of a work study program, or even within the halls of the academy itself, you'll have to learn to juggle your dual life.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in your choice of [[Arcana]], [[Nature]], [[Occultism]], or [[Religion]], and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Recognize Spell]] skill feat.
