You are a prominent member of a royal family. You have taken up the life of an adventurer—perhaps you're a deposed queen hoping to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting life, or a princess on a secret mission.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You are trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]]. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Courtly Graces|Courtly Graces]] skill feat and can influence commoners in your family's territory, as well as nobility anywhere. If you later gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Connections|Connections]] skill feat, you automatically have common and noble connections within any community in your royal family's territory and have noble connections in large communities outside your territory.
