**Source** [[Little Trouble in Big Absalom]]
**Prerequisites** [[Kobold]] ancestry
You are a digger from the Hookclaw kobold tribe, born beneath the streets of Absalom, with muscles and mind hardened by years spent tunneling through rock and earth and a confidence built upon your pride in your draconic heritage.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You're trained in the [[Crafting]] skill, the [[Lore]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Improvise Tool]] skill feat.
