Your life has been difficult, in no small part due to the influence of all things fiendish in your past. You might be a tiefling whose heritage has resulted in you being shunned or ostracized by society, or you could be any ancestry who grew up in a land where fiendish influence lingers—such as [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|devil]]-haunted Cheliax or the realm of Sarkoris Scar, where the influence of the Worldwound and its [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|demonic]] invaders yet linger. Perhaps you carry an old scar or wound from a frightening encounter with a demon, have a fiend-related element as part of your class (such as a sorcerer bloodline or a fiendish patron whom you worship), or endured a long-term affliction from a fiendish source that only recently has been alleviated. Whatever the case, fate has thrown horror and terror at you at every turn, and that's taught you to always be ready for whatever those fiends might have in store for you next.
 This background is associated with the suit of Hammers.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Hefty Hauler|Hefty Hauler]] skill feat and are trained in one of the following [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skills, as fits your history: [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Daemon|Daemon]] Lore, [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Demon|Demon]] Lore, or [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Devil|Devil]] Lore. You also gain the following free action.
 **Harrow the Fiend** <span class="action-icon">4</span> (fortune) **Trigger** You start your turn in combat against a foe or foes you recognize to be fiends; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain a +1 status bonus on all Strikes or spell attack rolls against fiends for the duration of combat. Once during combat, you can draw a harrow card after you determine if a Strike or spell attack on a fiend hits but before you determine damage or effects caused to the fiend. If you draw a card from the suit of Hammers, increase the degree of success of your Strike or spell attack by one.
