You dedicated yourself to intense training and rigorous study to become a great warrior. The school you attended might have been a traditionalist monastery, an elite military academy, or the local branch of a prestigious mercenary organization.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in your choice of either the [[Acrobatics]] or [[Athletics]] skill, as well as the [[Lore]] skill. You gain a skill feat: [[Cat Fall]] if you chose [[Acrobatics]] or [[Quick Jump]] if you chose [[Athletics]].
