**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Secrets of Magic|Secrets of Magic]] 
You have long been gifted with the ability to see and speak with the departed. This could have manifested at your birth or when a chance encounter linked you inextricably to the spirits of the dead. Their constant presence might feel like a curse, or it might provide you with welcome companionship.
 You gain one ability boost. It must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**.
 You're trained in [[DATABASE/skill/Religion|Religion]] and [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Undead Lore]]. You gain the effects of the [[DATABASE/spell/Spirit Sense|spirit sense]] spell at all times.
