# Rivethun Adherent<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Shining Kingdoms
You have spent time learning the practices and traditions of the ancient Rivethun dwarven shamans and can recognize all sorts of magic. You may have chosen your own road since then, or you may remain an adherent of the philosophy.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Occultism]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Recognize Spell]] skill feat.
