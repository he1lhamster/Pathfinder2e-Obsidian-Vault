You aspire to perfect your body and mind in the tradition of Jalmeray’s Houses of Perfection, honing your acrobatic skills and mental faculties in preparation for a lifetime pushing the edge of what most consider possible.

You're trained in the [[Acrobatics]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Cat Fall]] skill feat.
