**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
In your younger days, you waded into battle as a mercenary, a warrior defending a nomadic people, or a member of a militia or army. You might have wanted to break out from the regimented structure of these forces, or you could have always been as independent a warrior as you are now.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Warfare Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Intimidating Glare|Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
