**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
You might have been imprisoned for crimes (whether you were guilty or not), or enslaved for some part of your upbringing. In your adventuring life, you take full advantage of your newfound freedom.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Stealth]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Experienced Smuggler]] skill feat.
