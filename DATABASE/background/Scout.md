You called the wilderness home as you found trails and guided travelers. Your wanderlust could have called you to the adventuring life, or perhaps you served as a scout for soldiers and found you liked battle.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] skill, and a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill related to one terrain you scouted in (such as Forest Lore or Cavern Lore). You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Forager|Forager]] skill feat.
