# Finadar Leshy<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[PFS Scenario 1-15. The Blooming Catastrophe]]
**Prerequisites** [[Leshy]] ancestry
You are a leshy from Finadar Forest, originally created under the corruption of a cyclopean monolith. Though the Pathfinder Society managed to sever the monolith’s connection, freeing the forest and your people from its influence, you retain a trace, unnerving connection to the Abyss.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Intimidation]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
