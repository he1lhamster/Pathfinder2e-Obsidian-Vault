**Source** [[DATABASE/source/PFS Scenario 1-15. The Blooming Catastrophe|PFS Scenario #1-15: The Blooming Catastrophe]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/ancestry/Leshy|Leshy]] ancestry
You are a leshy from Finadar Forest, originally created under the corruption of a cyclopean monolith. Though the Pathfinder Society managed to sever the monolith’s connection, freeing the forest and your people from its influence, you retain a trace, unnerving connection to the Abyss.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Abyssal Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Intimidating Glare|Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
