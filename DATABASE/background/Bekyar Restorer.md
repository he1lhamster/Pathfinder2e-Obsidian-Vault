**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Mwangi Expanse
Though many Bekyars worship demons, you seek to pave a different path for yourself and your kindred, while also attempting to change other Mwangi’s treatment of your culture.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Diplomacy]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Group Impression]] skill feat.
