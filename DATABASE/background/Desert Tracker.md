You’re at home blazing trails in the burning sands, and you made a living guiding or following creatures in the desert. You might be a native nomad, an experienced desert guide, a naturalist, a bandit driven into the dunes by the law—or all of the above.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Desert Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Experienced Tracker|Experienced Tracker]] skill feat.
