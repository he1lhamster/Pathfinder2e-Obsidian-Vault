# Desert Tracker<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Golden Road
You’re at home blazing trails in the burning sands, and you made a living guiding or following creatures in the desert. You might be a native nomad, an experienced desert guide, a naturalist, a bandit driven into the dunes by the law—or all of the above.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Survival]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Experienced Tracker]] skill feat.
