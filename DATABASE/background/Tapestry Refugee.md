# Tapestry Refugee<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[Organized Play Foundation]]
Within her magnificent museum demiplane, the sorcerer Hao Jin extracted and preserved countless sites and cultures. The demiplane’s unraveling magic forced the Pathfinder Society to evacuate the many inhabitants recently, and you were among the refugees who returned to the [[Material Plane]] after centuries of isolation. Whether you joined the Society out of gratitude, curiosity, or desperation, you are hardened by your harrowing flight from your doomed home.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in your choice of either the [[Medicine]] or [[Stealth]] skill, as well as a [[Lore]] skill related to the terrain you lived in while on the demiplane (such as [[Lore]] or [[Lore]]). You gain the [[Assurance]] skill feat with the skill you chose to become trained in (Medicine or Stealth).
