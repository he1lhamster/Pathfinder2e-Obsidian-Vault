Though Osprey Cove is a quiet village, you've scouted the wilderness inland, watching for any dangerous wildlife or creatures in order to keep it that way. Elder Ordwi wants you along on this trip because she knows your knowledge about the Kindred Coast will help ensure the safety of the group on the day-long trip.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Scouting Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Experienced Tracker|Experienced Tracker]] skill feat.
