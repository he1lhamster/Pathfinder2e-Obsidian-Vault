# Archaeologist<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
You've excavated enough sites to know that ancient civilizations aren't lost; they're merely buried and waiting for the right scholar to unearth them and tell their story. You might have worked as a laborer or local guide before learning formal archaeological techniques.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Society]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Additional Lore]] skill feat related to an ancient culture or the history of a culture you've studied (such as Azlanti Lore or Osirian History Lore).
