In a dusty shop, market stall, or merchant caravan, you bartered wares for coin and trade goods. The skills you picked up still apply in the adventuring life, in which a good deal on a suit of armor could prevent your death.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Mercantile Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Bargain Hunter|Bargain Hunter]] skill feat.
