You were forced into service as a sailor against your will. Perhaps you were punished for a crime, were drafted into military service, are repaying a debt, or simply were abducted. Though you were initially trained as a simple deckhand, you may have subsequently studied a trade under one of the vessel's specialists.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Society]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Experienced Professional]] skill feat.
