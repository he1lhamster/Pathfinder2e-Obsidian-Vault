# Union Representative<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Highhelm|Highhelm]]
You might have fought for fairer ore distribution for the Metalmaker's Union, higher chef's pay in the Provisioners' Union, or better mercenary contracts for the Union of Axe and Coin. Whatever the case, you have experience in the high-stakes world of the negotiating table, experience that translates surprisingly well to adventuring.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Legal Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Contract Negotiator|Contract Negotiator]] skill feat.
