You spent years predicting, identifying, and harnessing the innate magical talents of those around you. A magic-rich world has taught you that you can never have too much training when everyone around you is capable of magic.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be **Intelligence** or **Wisdom** and one is a free ability boost.
 Your innate magical trait is arcane or occult. You're trained in either [[Arcana]] or [[Occultism]], depending on your innate magical trait, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Recognize Spell]] skill feat.
