# Occult Librarian<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[Secrets of Magic]] 
Hours spent reading numerous compendiums dedicated to various occult topics honed your knowledge of these more obscure magical arts. You might have taken to adventuring to finance your acquisition of rare tomes, to explore occult mysteries that can't be found in the pages of a book, or perhaps to put your skills to the test.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Occultism]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Schooled in Secrets]] skill feat.
