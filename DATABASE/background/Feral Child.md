You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to or perhaps raised by animals. You have a close, mystical connection with these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.
 Choose one ability boost. It must be **Strength**, **Dexterity**, or **Constitution**.
 You are trained in [[Nature]] and [[Survival]]. You gain low-light vision (or darkvision if you already had low-light vision), imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet, and the [[Forager]] skill feat.
