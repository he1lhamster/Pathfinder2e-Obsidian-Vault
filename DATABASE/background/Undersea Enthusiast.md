# Undersea Enthusiast<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/World Guide|World Guide]] 
**Region** High Seas
You love diving and exploring the world beneath the waves, and long periods of swimming have trained you to move easily through the water. You're also fascinated by undersea creatures and cultures—and may even have a trace of one of them in your own lineage.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Ocean Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Underwater Marauder|Underwater Marauder]] skill feat.
