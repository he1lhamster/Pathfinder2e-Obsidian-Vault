**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
You learned the healing arts of your community wielding your ceremonial chonta, a tool you carved yourself and imbued with sacred oils and herbs. This process opened your eyes to ailments of a more mystical nature: malefic spirits, haunts, possession, and more. You likely took up adventuring to combat these horrors, or you may have fled an evil beyond your power to vanquish.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Herbalism Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Inoculation|Inoculation]] skill feat.
