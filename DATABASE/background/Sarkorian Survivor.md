**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Broken Lands
The devastation and carnage of the Worldwound were nearly complete, but you somehow managed to survive it.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Strength**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Survival]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Forager]] skill feat.
