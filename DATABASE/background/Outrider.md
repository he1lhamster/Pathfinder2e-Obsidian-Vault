**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
In your youth, you galloped on horseback over vast prairies, serving as a vanguard for your settlement, an army, or another group. Seeing so many different lands built a thirst in you to adventure and explore the world instead of just racing past it.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Nature]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Express Rider]] skill feat.
