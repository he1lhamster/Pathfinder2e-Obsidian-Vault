# Aspiring Free Captain<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** High Seas
You seek to join the Free Captains of the Shackles and have learned everything you need to know about sailing and bossing people around. Now you just need a crew and a ship.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Intimidation]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Group Coercion]] skill feat.
