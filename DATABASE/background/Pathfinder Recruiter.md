# Pathfinder Recruiter<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[PFS Guide]]
The Pathfinder Society's always on the lookout for talent, but that talent rarely just stumbles into the Grand Lodge. Whether you're professionally trained to encourage new recruits or the Society's own scouts identified your potential and raised you from childhood, you're committed to expanding the Society's roster.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Diplomacy]] skill, and a [[Lore]] skill related to one city you've visited often. You gain the [[Group Impression]] skill feat.
