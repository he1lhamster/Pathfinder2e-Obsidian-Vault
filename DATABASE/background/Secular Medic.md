You’re from Rahadoum, where the Laws of Mortality taught you to reject the gods, yet you’ve seen firsthand how dangerous it can be to go without healing magic. As a result, you’ve thrown yourself into the study of medicine, so you can save lives without saving souls.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Anatomy Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]] skill feat.
