Tasked by the Concordance of Elements to research a variety of enigmatic planar phenomena, you've acquired very specific knowledge about the planes and the interactions between them. While being a researcher is usually a peaceful profession, the Concordance might require you to go out into the field and research unstable planar situations.
 Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.
 You're trained in four of the following: [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Air Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Earth Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Fire Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Metal Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Water Lore]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Wood Lore]].
