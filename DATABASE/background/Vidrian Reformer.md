You know that the only way your homeland of Vidrian can remain free from outside conquerors is by forging a strong and unified government. As such, you seek to bind your fellow citizens together through careful diplomacy and force of personality—or, if necessary, subterfuge and intrigue.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Politics Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Hobnobber|Hobnobber]] skill feat.
