You're a good friend of Benedet, the majordomo of Greensteeples Manor in Egorian, Cheliax. You've learned a thing or two about surviving against all odds thanks to your close association with House Jeggare and the clandestine Pathfinder Society operations based out of Greensteeples.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You're trained in your choice of the [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] skills, and gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Assurance|Assurance]] skill feat with your chosen skill. You're also trained in a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill about a narrow category of creatures.
 Additionally, when you receive a mission briefing at Greensteeples Manor (or a briefing from Benedet or Varian Jeggare at another location), you receive a warm welcome. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge during the Getting Started segment of such adventures. Be sure to remind your GM that you have a relevant background.
