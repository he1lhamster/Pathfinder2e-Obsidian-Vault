# Haunted Citizen<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
You grew up in a region where undead lurk everywhere. This could be a domain as small as a vampire's fief or as vast as the nation of Ustalav. As an ever-present concern, the undead greatly shaped your life. Living with fear became an everyday skill... as did pleading for your life.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill, and a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill for your home settlement. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/No Cause for Alarm|No Cause for Alarm]] skill feat.
