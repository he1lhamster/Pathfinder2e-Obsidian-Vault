# Oenopion Ooze-Tender<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Impossible Lands
Your apprenticeship in one of Oenopion’s unorthodox arcane and alchemical academies instilled in you a deep reservoir of mostly reliable esoteric knowledge, not to mention a deep resentment born of countless hours spent mucking ooze pens and feeding helpless creatures to ravenous, belching jellies and gelatinous puddings.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Crafting]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
