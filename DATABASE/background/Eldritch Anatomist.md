You're a trained physician who can ably tend wounds of many kinds. But more than a practitioner, you're a scholar.

The fleshforges of distant Nex practice this fleshwarping, as do certain subterranean societies you hope to one day study— preferably from a safe and clinical distance.

You're trained in the [[Medicine]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Assurance]] skill feat with Medicine
