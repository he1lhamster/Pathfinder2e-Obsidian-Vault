**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
You were born into a lineage of undead slayers. No mere occupation, in your family slaying is a mantle of almost mystic responsibility passed from parent to child. Over the generations, this single-minded focus has begun to manifest in uncanny ways during combat.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] skill and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Undead Lore]] skill. You can cast [[DATABASE/spell/Disrupt Undead|disrupt undead]] as an innate divine cantrip. You can use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for this innate spell.
