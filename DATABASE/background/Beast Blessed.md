**Source** [[Firebrands]]
You once freed a magical beast from captivity and, whether it was intentional or a byproduct of another action, the grateful creature bestowed a blessing of freedom upon you. Your blessing manifests physically, perhaps as elongated canines, fingernails that grow to a sharp point, excess body hair, or some other feature. This physical manifestation is cosmetic and provides no benefit.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You are trained in the [[Survival]] skill. You gain the Bestial Clarity reaction.
 **Bestial Clarity** <span class="action-icon">5</span> **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You fail a saving throw against an enchantment effect; **Effect** Your bestial manifestation becomes more pronounced, and your mind gains a flash of clarity as your instincts take over. You can reroll the triggering saving throw with a +2 circumstance bonus, but you must use the new result. This is a fortune effect.
