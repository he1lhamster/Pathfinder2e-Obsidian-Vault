**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
You’ve made a living sorting through the things society throws away. You might have scavenged simply to survive, or plied a trade as a ragpicker, dung carter, or the like. While you’ve left that life behind, you still keep one eye on the ground out of habit.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] skill, and a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill for the settlement you grew up scavenging in. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Forager|Forager]] skill feat.
