**Source** [[Highhelm]]
The machinations and scheming of King's Crown have trained you to be on the lookout for those who seem out of place. You've learned to spot when the person pouring your tea has sword calluses—or when the person wearing a guard's uniform doesn't.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Society]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Courtly Graces]] skill feat.
