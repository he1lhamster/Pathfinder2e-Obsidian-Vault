You used to run certain “errands” for Gloriana Morilla, a close confidante of Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian, the ruler of Taldor. Gloriana took note of your skills and suggested you join the Pathfinder Society, a group she's heavily involved in herself.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You're trained in the [[Thievery]] skill and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Subtle Theft]] skill feat.
 Additionally, when Gloriana Morilla is present during your mission briefings, she discreetly checks in with you and provides some pointers. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge during the Getting Started segment of such adventures. Be sure to remind your GM that you have a relevant background.
