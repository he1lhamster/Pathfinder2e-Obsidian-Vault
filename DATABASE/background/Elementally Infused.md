**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
You were exposed to a strong burst of elemental essence originating directly from an elemental plane, most likely caused by a planar breach. Your body absorbed the elemental essence with no ill effects, and now it coalesces within you. With time, you've learned to project elemental power in a manner safe to you but still deadly to others.
 Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.
 Choose one elemental plane: [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Air|Air]], [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Earth|Earth]], [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Fire|Fire]], [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Metal|Metal]], [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Water|Water]], or [[DATABASE/plane/Plane of Wood|Wood]]. You are trained in the corresponding [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill: [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Air Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Earth Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Fire Lore, ]][[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Metal Lore]], [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Water Lore]], or [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Plane of Wood Lore]]. You also gain a cantrip according to your chosen plane: **air** [[DATABASE/spell/Gale Blast|gale blast]]; **Earth**: [[DATABASE/spell/Scatter Scree|scatter scree]]; **Fire**: [[DATABASE/spell/Produce Flame|ignition]]; **Metal**: [[DATABASE/spell/Needle Darts|needle darts]]; **Water** [[DATABASE/spell/Spout|spout]], or **wood** [[DATABASE/spell/Root Reading|root reading]]. You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will.
