**Source** [[Rage of Elements]]
You were exposed to a strong burst of elemental essence originating directly from an elemental plane, most likely caused by a planar breach. Your body absorbed the elemental essence with no ill effects, and now it coalesces within you. With time, you've learned to project elemental power in a manner safe to you but still deadly to others.
 Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.
 Choose one elemental plane: [[Plane of Air]], [[Plane of Earth]], [[Plane of Fire]], [[Plane of Metal]], [[Plane of Water]], or [[Plane of Wood]]. You are trained in the corresponding [[Lore]] skill: [[Lore]], [[Lore]], [[Lore]][[Lore]], [[Lore]], or [[Lore]]. You also gain a cantrip according to your chosen plane: **air** [[Gale Blast]]; **Earth**: [[Scatter Scree]]; **Fire**: [[Produce Flame]]; **Metal**: [[Needle Darts]]; **Water** [[Spout]], or **wood** [[Root Reading]]. You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will.
