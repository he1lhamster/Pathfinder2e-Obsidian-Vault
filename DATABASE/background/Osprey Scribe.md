Either as a punishment or because of political ambition, you work for Elder Vandous. On her trip to Iron Harbor, Elder Ordwi needs someone at her side who is a skilled observer and adept at keeping journals; she hopes to provide the other elders with accurate information about their sibling village upon her return.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Demon Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Streetwise|Streetwise]] skill feat.
