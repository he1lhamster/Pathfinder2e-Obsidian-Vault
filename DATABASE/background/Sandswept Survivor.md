You were in the Sandswept Hall, the Pathfinder Society's lodge in Sothis, Osirion, when it came under attack from an unrelenting horde of undead. You endured the siege and forged new bonds with your fellow survivors, then joined the Society as a field agent.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You're trained in the [[Survival]] skill and a Lore skill related to a specific type of undead, such as [[Lore]] or [[Lore]]. You gain the [[Terrain Expertise]] skill feat with underground terrain.
 Additionally, when you receive a mission briefing at the Sandswept Hall, your familiarity with its history and staff grants further insight. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge during the Getting Started segment of such adventures. Be sure to remind your GM that you have a relevant background.
