You’re skilled at shouting to catch and keep the attention of passersby. A few well-timed and forcefully spoken words not only get people to notice you but also engage them to respond to you. You may have previously worked as a crier or in a more formal barker capacity with Mistress Dusklight’s Celestial Menagerie. Either way, your ability to bully a crowd is impressive.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Crowd Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Group Coercion|Group Coercion]] skill feat.
