**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
In the chaotic rush of battle, you learned to adapt to rapidly changing conditions as you administered to battle casualties. You patched up soldiers, guards, or other combatants, and learned a fair amount about the logistics of war.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Medicine|Medicine]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Warfare Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]] skill feat.
