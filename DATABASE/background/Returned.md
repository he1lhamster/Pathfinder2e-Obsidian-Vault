You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you. 
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Diehard|Diehard]] feat and the [[DATABASE/feat/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] feat for [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Boneyard Lore]].
