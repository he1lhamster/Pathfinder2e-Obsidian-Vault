**Source** [[Stolen Fate Player's Guide]]
From as far back as you can remember, it seems you were always meant to enter a specific industry or profession, be it artistry, engineering, farming, herbalism, labor, merchantry, scribing, theater, or warfare. Perhaps your parents belonged to this profession and encouraged you to follow in their footsteps, or maybe a personal hero of yours inspired you to take up their calling in honor of their accomplishments. Whatever the reason, the skills associated with that profession came naturally to you, but as time wore on and you grew older, you began to realize that this profession, while interesting to you, isn't what you want to do with your life. The lure of glory and adventure beckons. You can always go back to the studio, farm, or stage once you retire, after all!
 This background is associated with the suit of Keys.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You gain the [[Assurance]] general skill feat and are trained in one of the following [[Lore]] skills associated with a profession, as befits your history: Art Lore, Engineering Lore, Farming Lore, Herbalism Lore, Labor Lore, Mercantile Lore, Scribing Lore, Theater Lore, or Warfare Lore. You also gain the following free action.
 **Lucky Break** <span class="action-icon">4</span> (fortune) **Trigger** You attempt a skill check during Exploration or Downtime; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Draw a harrow card, then reroll the skill check. If you draw a card from the suit of Keys, add a +4 status bonus to the original roll and your reroll, then take the result you prefer as your actual result. If you drew any other card, you gain no bonus and must take the result of the rerolled skill check.
