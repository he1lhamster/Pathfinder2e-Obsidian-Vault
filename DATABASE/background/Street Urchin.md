**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
You eked out a living by picking pockets on the streets of a major city, never knowing where you’d find your next meal. While some folk adventure for the glory, you do so to survive.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Thievery|Thievery]] skill, and a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill for the city you lived in as a street urchin (such as Absalom Lore or Magnimar Lore). You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Pickpocket|Pickpocket]] skill feat.
