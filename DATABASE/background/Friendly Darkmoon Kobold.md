**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Crown of the Kobold King|Crown of the Kobold King]]
**Prerequisites** [[DATABASE/ancestry/Kobold|Kobold]] ancestry
It has taken time, but over the years, you've managed to find a place among the citizens of Falcon's Hollow. While many still distrust [[DATABASE/ancestry/Kobold|kobolds]], they at least see you as a fellow villager, if not a friend, and you've got quite the talent for quickly convincing larger groups of people that you mean them no harm.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Kobold Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Group Impression|Group Impression]] skill feat.
