You trained under Venture-Captain Muesello of the Oppara Lodge in Taldor. You learned a few of the mage-machinist's crafting techniques, and your extensive knowledge of magic items comes in handy during your adventures as a Pathfinder field agent. 
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Crafting|Crafting]] skill and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Engineering Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Crafter's Appraisal|Crafter's Appraisal]] skill feat.
 Additionally, when Muesello is present during your mission briefings, he takes some time to catch up with you and discuss your mission. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge during the Getting Started segment of such adventures. Be sure to remind your GM that you have a relevant background.
