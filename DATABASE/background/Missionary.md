# Missionary<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[The Fall of Plaguestone]]
You received training from clergy in a faraway temple, who sent you out into the world to spread the faith. Although you are relatively new at this, you are always on the lookout for new places in need of your deity’s teachings and guidance. When play begins, you are riding along in a caravan making your way through sparsely populated regions of Isger, spreading the news of your faith to those who will listen.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Diplomacy]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Group Impression]] skill feat.
