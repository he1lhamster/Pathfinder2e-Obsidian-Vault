**Region** Saga Lands
Your or one of your ancestors hails from Irrisen, and some spark of the icy region’s magic has manifested itself within your bones. The blood of Baba Yaga’s legacy runs in your veins, and you are at one with the mysteries and dangers of the frozen land.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Arcana|Arcana]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Weather Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Arcane Sense|Arcane Sense]] skill feat.
