Haircuts, dentistry, bloodletting, and surgery—if it takes a steady hand and a razor, you do it. You may have taken to the road to expand your skills, or to test yourself against a world that leaves your patients so battered and bruised.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Medicine]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Risky Surgery]] skill feat.
