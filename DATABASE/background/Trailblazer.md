Uncharted realms have always intrigued you, and you've explored and mapped large territories in service to merchants, governments, or your own curiosity. Where some see a blank spot on a map, you see the potential for something new and undiscovered.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Cartography Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Terrain Expertise|Terrain Expertise]] skill feat with one terrain you've explored (such as forest or underground).
