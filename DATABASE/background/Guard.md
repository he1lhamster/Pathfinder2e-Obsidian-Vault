You served in the guard, out of either patriotism or the need for coin. Either way, you know how to get a difficult suspect to talk. However you left the guard, you might think of adventuring as a way to use your skills on a wider stage.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Legal Lore]] skill or Warfare Lore skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Quick Coercion|Quick Coercion]] skill feat.
