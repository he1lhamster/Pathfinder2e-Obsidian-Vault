**Region** Shining Kingdoms
You fell prey to the whims of the Galtan mob and were scheduled for execution by _final blade_, but through skill—or sheer luck—you managed to talk your way out of it.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Revolution Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Charming Liar|Charming Liar]] skill feat.
