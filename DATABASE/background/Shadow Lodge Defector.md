# Shadow Lodge Defector<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Organized Play Foundation|Organized Play Foundation]]
You were among the Pathfinders recruited by the devious Shadow Lodge, lured in by promises of wealth, reform, justice, or revenge. You might have fought against the Society’s loyal agents, helped sabotage the Pathfinders’ reputation in distant countries, or even infiltrated the far-flung lodges as a spy. You’ve since made peace with and rejoined the Pathfinder Society, yet the underhanded reflexes and skills you learned are hard to forget.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Underworld Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Lie to Me|Lie to Me]] skill feat.
