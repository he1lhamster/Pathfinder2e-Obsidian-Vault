**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Golden Road
Whether you’re a fascinated outsider or a local proud of your nation’s storied past, you’re a devoted student of Osirion’s history. You might be a traveling professor, a member of a society like the Pathfinders or the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, or even a simple tomb robber cashing in on the glories of the past.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Occultism]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Oddity Identification]] skill feat.
