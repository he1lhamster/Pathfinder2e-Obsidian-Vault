You live on the outskirts of civilization, combing through the detritus left behind for interesting trinkets to sell or use in your own crafting. Though you have a preferred terrain to search, you know that the greatest treasures occur where people make greater use of technology.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Athletics|Athletics]] skill, and a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill of the terrain in which you scavenge. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Hefty Hauler|Hefty Hauler]] skill feat.
