The thrill of the win drew you into games of chance. This might have been a lucrative sideline that paled in comparison to the real risks of adventuring, or you might have fallen on hard times due to your gambling and pursued adventuring as a way out of a spiral.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Deception|Deception]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Games Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Lie to Me|Lie to Me]] skill feat.
