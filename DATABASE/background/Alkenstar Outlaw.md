**Source** [[Guns & Gears]]
You're an outlaw whose first crime was stealing the guns from Alkenstar's Gunworks which allowed you to commence a crime spree of epic proportions. You don't know where your road ends, but it's probably going to be a bloody affair. The life of an adventurer might even be a relief compared to a life forever on the run from Alkenstar authorities and their allies.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Thievery]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Subtle Theft]] skill feat.
