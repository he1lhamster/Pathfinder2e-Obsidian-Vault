**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
You have always felt a connection to animals, and it was only a small leap to learn to train them. As you travel, you continuously encounter different creatures, befriending them along the way.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Nature]] skill, and a [[Lore]] skill related to one terrain inhabited by animals you like (such as Plains Lore or Swamp Lore). You gain the [[Train Animal]] skill feat.
