You grew up in northern Brevoy, but the call for heroes willing to help take back your country's rightful holdings in the Stolen Lands has inflamed your dreams of profit and possibilities, and you have joined an expedition journeying south.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Society|Society]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Legal Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Streetwise|Streetwise]] skill feat.
