**Source** [[Firebrands]]
You served as a messenger for a specific faction, guild, house, or individual, often running those messages on a short timeline. Finding the quickest path from point A to point B is your specialty and you've learned to make the most of your athleticism and navigational skill.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Athletics]] skill, and a [[Lore]] skill for the city in which you were a messenger. You gain the [[Quick Jump]] skill feat.
