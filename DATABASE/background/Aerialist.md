Experienced with trapezes, aerial silks, and hoops, your skill is in performing death-defying stunts high above the ground. The Celestial Menagerie skimped on safety devices such as nets and quality ropes, so you also learned to take a fall better than most. After a harrowing near-death experience involving a cracked trapeze bar, you decided to take your expertise elsewhere.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[DATABASE/skill/Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] skill, and the [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Rope Lore]] skill. You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Cat Fall|Cat Fall]] skill feat.
