Either as a guest, event staff, or part of the construction crew, you spent a significant stretch of time at the Pathfinder Society's new lodge in Sedeq. The lodge serves as a new home for those fleeing from oppression or otherwise seeking a fresh start in Qadira. The magic and marvels you witnessed at the lodge inspired you to find more excitement as a member of the Pathfinder Society.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
 You're trained in your choice of the [[Arcana]] or [[Religion]] skills, as well as your choice of the [[Lore]] or [[Lore]] skills. You gain the [[Recognize Spell]] skill feat.
