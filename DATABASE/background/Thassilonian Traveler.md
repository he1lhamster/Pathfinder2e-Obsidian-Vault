# Thassilonian Traveler<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Saga Lands
You come from ancient Thassilon, one of the citizens that appeared out of time alongside the city of Xin-Edasseril. You know many things that have been long forgotten... along with many things that are no longer correct.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Arcana]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
