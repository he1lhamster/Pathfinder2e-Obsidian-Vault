# Mystic Seer<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[Extinction Curse Player's Guide]]
You delight crowds by reading minds, telling futures, and contacting spirits. Although much of your work is misdirection and showmanship, your cons have inadvertently awakened a genuine awareness of magic in your mind. This new sense is both thrilling and frightening, and you hope that you can hone it further in the Circus of Wayward Wonders.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Arcana]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Arcane Sense]] skill feat.
