# Mana Wastes Refugee<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Impossible Lands
Exposure to the corrupting influence of the Mana Wastes’ strange energies has warped your inner essence, resulting in unpredictable interactions with magic items and more than a little know-how about surviving under bizarre and adverse natural conditions.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Arcana]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Trick Magic Item]] skill feat.
