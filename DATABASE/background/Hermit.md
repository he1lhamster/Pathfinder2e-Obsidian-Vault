**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Core Rulebook|Core Rulebook]] 
In an isolated place—like a cave, remote oasis, or secluded mansion—you lived a life of solitude. Adventuring might represent your first foray out among other people in some time. This might be a welcome reprieve from solitude or an unwanted change, but in either case, you’re likely still rough around the edges.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in your choice of either the [[DATABASE/skill/Nature|Nature]] or [[DATABASE/skill/Occultism|Occultism]] skill, as well as a [[DATABASE/skill/Lore|Lore]] skill related to the terrain you lived in as a hermit (such as Cave Lore or Desert Lore). You gain the [[DATABASE/feat/Dubious Knowledge|Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
