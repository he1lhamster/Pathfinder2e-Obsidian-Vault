**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** Old Cheliax
Whether you come from Westcrown or elsewhere, you hold the values of pre-Thrune Cheliax dear. You disdain the infernal government, but you are proud of your country and do not consider yourself a rebel.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Diplomacy]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Group Impression]] skill feat.
