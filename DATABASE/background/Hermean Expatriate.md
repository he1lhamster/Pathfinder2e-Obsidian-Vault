# Hermean Expatriate<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[World Guide]] 
**Region** High Seas
You have been exiled from Hermea, perhaps of your own accord or perhaps because you didn't measure up. However, you take with you some of the benefits of the excellent education afforded to its citizenry.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Society]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Skill Training]] skill feat.
