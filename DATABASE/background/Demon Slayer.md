# Demon Slayer<span class="item-type">Background</span>

**Source** [[Organized Play Foundation]]
For over a century, Mendev led a multinational coalition against ever-growing abyssal invaders in the Worldwound, and the Pathfinder Society aided in the so-called Fifth Crusade that ultimately sealed the planar rift and defeated its [[Demon]] armies. You might be a hardened recruit who clashed with the demons, or perhaps you were a survivor who lost everything to the fiendish armies and narrowly escaped—or was rescued by Pathfinders. Your exposure to the Worldwound has taught you vital lessons in identifying fiends and their magic.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in the [[Religion]] skill, and the [[Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Recognize Spell]] skill feat. Add [[Abyssal]] to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.
