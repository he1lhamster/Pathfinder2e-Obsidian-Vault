# Ulgrem-Lurann

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Monsters of Myth|Monsters of Myth]]
Your companion is one of the few surviving members of a formerly lost species, hatched from the last clutch of Ulgrem-Axaan. As it's so young, its intelligence hasn't developed yet, but some day, it will become a highly intelligent creature. An Ulgrem-Lurann has the beast trait instead of the animal trait but otherwise functions normally as an animal companion.
**Size** Medium
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws, **Damage** 1d8 piercing
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> tail, **Damage** 1d6 bludgeoning
**Str** +3, **Dex** +2, **Con** +2, **Int** -4, **Wis** +0, **Cha** +1
**Hit Points** 6
**Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] 
**Senses** darkvision
**Speed** 20 feet, swim 25 feet
**Special** The Ulgrem-Lurann has the amphibious trait.
**Support Benefit** The Ulgrem-Lurann grabs at your foe and zaps it. Until the start of your next turn, each time you hit a creature in the Ulgrem-Lurann's reach with a Strike, the creature takes an additional 1d4 piercing damage and 1d4 electricity damage from the Ulgrem-Lurann. If the Ulgrem-Lurann is nimble or savage, the piercing damage and electricity damage each increase to 2d4.
**Advanced Maneuver** Snatch and Zap

The Ulgrem-Lurann bites down hard and unleashes an electrical discharge. It makes a jaws Strike. If the Strike hits, the target creature automatically becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] by the Ulgrem-Lurann and takes 1d4 electricity damage (2d4 for a mature Ulgrem-Lurann or 3d4 for a specialized companion). The grabbed condition lasts until the end of your next turn, though the Ulgrem-Lurann can use [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] to attempt to extend the duration as normal.
