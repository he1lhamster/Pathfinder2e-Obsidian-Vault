**Support Benefit** The monitor lizard distracts an adjacent opponent with snapping jaws and rapid movements. Until the start of your next turn, if your Strike damages a foe, any time the foe attempts an action with the manipulate trait until the end of your next turn, it must attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the action is disrupted.
