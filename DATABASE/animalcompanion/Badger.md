# Badger

**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw (agile), **Damage** 1d6 slashing
**Str** +2, **Dex** +2, **Con** +2, **Int** -4, **Wis** +2, **Cha** +0

**Support Benefit** Your badger digs around your foe’s position, interfering with its footing. Until the start of your next turn, if you hit and deal damage to a creature your badger threatens, the target can’t use a Step action (unless it can Step through difficult terrain) until it moves from its current position.
**Advanced Maneuver** Badger Rage

### [[Badger Rage]] <span class="action-icon">1</span>

<span class="item-trait">Concentrate</span><span class="item-trait">Emotion</span><span class="item-trait">Mental</span>
**Source** [[Core Rulebook]] 
**Requirements** The badger isn’t [[Fatigued]] or raging.

---
The badger enters a state of pure rage that lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies it can perceive, or until it falls [[Unconscious]], whichever comes first. It can’t voluntarily stop raging. While raging, the badger is affected in the following ways.

* It deals 4 additional damage with its bite attacks and 2 additional damage with its claw attacks. 
* It takes a –1 penalty to AC. 
* It can’t use actions that have the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. The animal companion can [[Seek]] even while raging.

After it has stopped raging, it can’t use Badger Rage again for 1 minute.
