**Support Benefit** The bird pecks at your foes’ eyes when you create an opening. Until the start of your next turn, your Strikes that damage a creature that your bird threatens also deal 1d4 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent]] bleed damage, and the target is [[DATABASE/condition/Dazzled|dazzled]] until it removes the bleed damage. If your bird is nimble or savage, the persistent bleed damage increases to 2d4.
**Advanced Maneuver** Flyby Attack
