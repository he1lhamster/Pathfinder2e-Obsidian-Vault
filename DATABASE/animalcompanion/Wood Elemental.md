**Support Benefit** Your wood elemental entangles your foes with detachable branches and roots. Until the start of your next turn, if you hit with a Strike that deals damage to a creature in your wood elemental's reach, the creature takes a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute (–10 on a critical success). The creature, or a creature adjacent to it, can use an Interact action to unravel the branches and roots and remove the penalty.
**Advanced Maneuver** Grabbing Branches
