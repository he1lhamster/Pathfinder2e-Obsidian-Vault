# Arboreal Sapling

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Your companion is a walking tree, a cousin of the great arboreal wardens and regents. An arboreal sapling has the plant trait instead of the animal trait, but it otherwise functions normally as an animal companion. They are typically only selected by [[Animal]] druids who are also members of the [[Leaf]].
**Access** You are a member of the [[Leaf]].
**Size** Small
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> branch, **Damage** 1d8 bludgeoning
**Str** +3, **Dex** +1, **Con** +2, **Int** -4, **Wis** +2, **Cha** +0
**Hit Points** 8
**Skill** [[Stealth]] 
**Senses** low-light vision
**Speed** 25 feet
**Support Benefit** Your arboreal sapling plants roots around your foe, impeding its movement. Until the start of your next turn, if you hit and deal damage to a creature in your arboreal sapling's reach, the first square the creature moves into after taking that damage is difficult terrain.
**Advanced Maneuver** Throw Rock
