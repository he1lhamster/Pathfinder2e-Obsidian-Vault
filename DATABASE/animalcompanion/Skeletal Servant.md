# Skeletal Servant

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
Your companion is a humanoid skeleton, mindless but capable of assisting in rudimentary chores. Like the [[Skeletal Mount]], it can be collapsed for easy storage.
**Size** Small or Medium
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws, **Damage** 1d8 piercing
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw (agile), **Damage** 1d6 slashing
**Str** +2, **Dex** +2, **Con** +1, **Int** -5, **Wis** +0, **Cha** +1
**Hit Points** 4
**Skill** none (mindless)
**Senses** darkvision
**Speed** 20 feet
**Special** mindless
**Support Benefit** Your skeletal servant jabs bones into your enemies to distract them while you attack. Until the start of your next turn, when a Strike you make hits and deals damage to a creature within your skeletal servant's reach, that target becomes [[Flat-Footed]] until the end of your next turn. 
**Advanced Maneuver** Screaming Skull

The skeleton removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws Strike with a range of 20 feet. Regardless of whether it hits, the target and all enemies within 10 feet must attempt a Will save or be [[Frightened]], or frightened 2 on a critical failure. This uses a trained DC using the skeleton's Charisma modifier or an expert DC if the skeleton is specialized. At the start of the skeleton's next turn, the head bounces, rolls, or flies back to reattach. The skeleton is [[Blinded]] while its head is away.
