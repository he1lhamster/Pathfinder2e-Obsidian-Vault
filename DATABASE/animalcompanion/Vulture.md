# Vulture

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 149. Against the Scarlet Triad|Pathfinder #149: Against the Scarlet Triad]]
Your companion is a vulture, condor, or other large scavenging bird.
**Size** Small
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws (finesse), **Damage** 1d8 piercing
**Str** +2, **Dex** +2, **Con** +2, **Int** -4, **Wis** +2, **Cha** +0
**Hit Points** 6
**Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Survival|Survival]] 
**Senses** low-light vision, scent (imprecise, 30 feet)
**Speed** 10 feet, fly 45 feet
**Special** Your vulture gains a +1 status bonus to all saves against disease, and if it rolls a success on a save against a disease, the result is a critical success instead.
**Support Benefit** The vulture retches and vomits onto a foe within 10 feet. Until the start of your next turn, if you hit and deal damage to the target, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become [[DATABASE/condition/Sickened|sickened 1]] (sickened 2 on a critical failure). The DC of the Fortitude save is 12 (or 14, if the vulture is a specialized animal companion) + your level + the vulture’s Constitution modifier.
**Advanced Maneuver** Feast on the Fallen
