# Water Wraith

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
Your companion is a water wraith, an amphibious and expressive lizard capable of changing the color of its scales as it pleases. While your companion hasn't yet matured into its full strength and intelligence, it still serves you with admirable tenacity and loyalty, not to mention its lamprey-like mouth of lacerating teeth and eight clawed, slashing feet.
**Access** Characters from Alkenstar have access to this companion
**Size** Small
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws, **Damage** 1d8 piercing
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> claw (agile), **Damage** 1d6 slashing
**Str** +3, **Dex** +2, **Con** +2, **Int** -4, **Wis** +1, **Cha** +0
**Hit Points** 6
**Skill** [[Survival]] 
**Senses** Normal
**Speed** 20 feet, swim 25 feet
**Special** The water wraith can hold its breath for about 2 hours.
**Support Benefit** Your water wraith hisses and changes colors swiftly in an iridescent clash, overwhelming your foes in an avalanche of shades and hues. Until the start of your next turn, each time you hit a creature within your water wraith's reach, the creature is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.
**Advanced Maneuver** Gulp Blood

### [[Gulp Blood]] <span class="action-icon">1</span>

**Source** [[Impossible Lands]]
**Requirements** The water wraith's last action was a successful jaws attack against a foe.

---
The water wraith gains 2d8 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 round, and the foe takes 2d6 [[Persistent Damage]]. If the water wraith has a specialization, the water wraith instead gains 3d8 temporary Hit Points, and the target takes 3d6 persistent bleed damage. If the targeted creature has absolutely no vital fluids, this ability might not function, at the GM's discretion.
