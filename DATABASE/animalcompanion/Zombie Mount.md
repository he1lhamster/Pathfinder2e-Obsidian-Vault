# Zombie Mount

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[Pathfinder 181. Zombie Feast]]
Your companion is the rotting, reanimated corpse of a horse, camel, or similar riding animal.
**Size** Large
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> hoof, **Damage** 1d8 bludgeoning
**Str** +2, **Dex** +1, **Con** +3, **Int** -5, **Wis** +0, **Cha** +0
**Hit Points** 8
**Skill** none (mindless)
**Senses** darkvision
**Speed** 30 feet
**Special** mindless
**Support Benefit** Your zombie mount chews on your enemies. Until the start of your next turn, each time you Strike while riding the zombie mount and hit a creature in the zombie mount's reach, the creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage from the zombie mount. If your zombie mount is nimble or savage, the bludgeoning damage increases to 2d4. This benefit is based on a zombie horse or camel, but might deal piercing damage if your mount has sharp teeth.
**Advanced Maneuver** Disgusting Gallop

The zombie mount Strides twice, spraying putrid spittle as it runs. Once during this movement, choose a creature adjacent to the zombie mount. The spittle splashes on it, and the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or be [[Sickened]]. The creature is then temporarily immune to the spittle for 24 hours. This uses a trained DC using the zombie mount's Constitution modifier, or an expert DC if the mount is specialized.
