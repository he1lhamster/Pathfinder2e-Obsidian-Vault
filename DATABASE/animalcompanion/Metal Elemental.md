# Metal Elemental

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Metal</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
Your companion is a metal elemental, such as a mercurial. Metal elementals don't have any special access because druids don't have an order dedicated to the elemental magic of metal.
**Size** Small
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> spike, **Damage** 1d8 piercing
**Str** +2, **Dex** +1, **Con** +2, **Int** -4, **Wis** +1, **Cha** +0
**Hit Points** 8
**Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] 
**Senses** [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]]
**Speed** 25 feet
**Support Benefit** Your metal elemental pierces an enemy with metal spikes that cause it to bleed. Until the start of your next turn, your Strikes that damage a creature in your metal elemental's reach also deal 1d6 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]]. If your metal elemental is nimble or savage, the persistent bleed damage increases to 2d6.
**Advanced Maneuver** Spiked Bunker

---
Your metal elemental surrounds itself with protective metal spikes, hunkering down defensively. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. Any creature that hits the metal elemental with a melee unarmed attack while it's in its Spiked Bunker takes 2d6 piercing damage (or 3d6 piercing damage if your metal elemental has a specialization). The metal elemental can't move, Strike, or take other actions that require it to use its body while in its Spiked Bunker, but it can retract the bunker as a single action, ending the effects.
