Your skeletal bird of prey makes an earsplitting, unnatural screech, deafening and startling an enemy within 30 feet. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour. The [[Frightened]] condition is a mental, emotion, and [[Fear]] effect, but the creature can still be [[Deafened]] if it's immune to these.
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is deafened for 1 round and frightened 1.
**Failure** The target is deafened for 1 minute and frightened 1.
**Critical Failure** The target is deafened for 10 minutes and frightened 2.
