The capybara sprays an adjacent target with its scent glands. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. Wiping off the musk takes an Interact action and ends the effect. This uses a trained DC using the capybara's Constitution modifier or an expert DC if the capybara is specialized.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [[DATABASE/condition/Clumsy|clumsy 1]] for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature is clumsy 1 for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The creature is clumsy 2 for 1 minute.
