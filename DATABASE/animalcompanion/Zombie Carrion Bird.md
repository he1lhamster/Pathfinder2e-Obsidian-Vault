# Zombie Carrion Bird

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Pathfinder 181. Zombie Feast|Pathfinder #181: Zombie Feast]]
Your companion is the zombified corpse of a large scavenging bird, such as a vulture or a raven, that subsists upon meat.
**Size** Small
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws, **Damage** 1d8 piercing
**Str** +2, **Dex** +1, **Con** +3, **Int** -5, **Wis** +0, **Cha** +0
**Hit Points** 6
**Skill** none (mindless)
**Senses** darkvision
**Speed** 10 feet, fly 30 feet
**Special** mindless
**Support Benefit** The zombie emits an aura of rot, causing wounds to fester. Until the start of your next turn, each time you hit and deal damage to a creature that's within 10 feet of the zombie carrion bird, the creature takes an additional 1d6 damage as the wound festers. If your carrion bird is nimble or savage, the damage increases to 2d6. This is a disease and necromancy effect.
**Advanced Maneuver** Pick at the Meat

### [[DATABASE/action/Pick at the Meat|Pick at the Meat]] <span class="action-icon">1</span>

**Requirements** The animal companion's last action was a successful jaws Strike.

Your bird picks at the wound it just created. The target of its jaws Strike takes 1d8 [[DATABASE/condition/Persistent Damage|bleed damage]], or 2d8 bleed damage if the bird is specialized.
