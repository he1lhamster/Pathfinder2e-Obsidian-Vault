# Air Elemental

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span><span class="item-trait">Air</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Rage of Elements|Rage of Elements]]
Your companion is an air elemental, such as a [[DATABASE/monster/Zephyr Hawk|zephyr hawk]].
**Access** You are a member of the [[DATABASE/druidicorder/Storm|storm order]].
**Size** Small
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> gust (finesse), **Damage** 1d6 bludgeoning
**Str** +1, **Dex** +2, **Con** +1, **Int** -4, **Wis** +1, **Cha** +1
**Hit Points** 4
**Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] 
**Senses** [[DATABASE/monsterability/Darkvision|darkvision]]
**Speed** fly 50 feet
**Support Benefit** Your air elemental swirls around you with concealing gusts, making it harder for your foes to hit you and possibly giving you a moment to hide. Until the start of your next turn, if you hit with a Strike and deal damage to a creature in your air elemental's reach, you are [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] to that creature until the start of your next turn.
**Advanced Maneuver** Circling Flyby

Your air elemental flies in a circle, blowing gusts at your foes before returning back to its starting position. The air elemental Flies up to half its Speed, makes two gust Strikes, then Flies up to half its Speed again to return to its original location. Both attacks count toward the air elemental's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after it makes both attacks.
