The cave gecko snaps out its tongue, attempting to pull a foe within 10 feet toward it. The gecko attempts an Athletics check against the foe's Fortitude DC. On a success, the cave gecko pulls the foe next to it. This movement is forced movement. On a critical success, the foe is also grabbed until the beginning of your next turn.
