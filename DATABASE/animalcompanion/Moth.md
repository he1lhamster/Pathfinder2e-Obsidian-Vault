# Moth

**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Grand Bazaar|Grand Bazaar]]
Your animal companion is a giant fruit-eating moth with a strong proboscis that can pierce skin.
**Size** Small
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> proboscis (finesse), **Damage** 1d6 piercing
**Str** +2, **Dex** +3, **Con** +1, **Int** -4, **Wis** +2, **Cha** +0
**Hit Points** 6
**Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] 
**Senses** darkvision, scent (imprecise, 30 feet)
**Speed** 15 feet, fly 30 feet
**Special** Your moth is invisible to echolocation.
**Support Benefit** Your moth releases a shower of dust to reveal your foes. Until the start of your next turn, if you damage a [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Hidden|hidden]] creature in your moth's reach with a Strike, that creature requires only a DC 3 flat check to target it if it's concealed, or DC 9 if it's hidden. The reduced DC lasts until the end of your next turn.
**Advanced Maneuver** Ultrasonic Scream

---
The moth flaps its wings and emits ultrasonic squeaks that scramble the senses of nearby creatures. Choose one creature within 30 feet of the moth. That creature must attempt a Fortitude save. This uses a trained DC using the moth's Constitution modifier or an expert DC if the moth is specialized.
**Success** The target treats all creatures as [[DATABASE/condition/Concealed|concealed]] on its next attack before the start of your next turn.
**Failure** The target treats all creatures as concealed until the start of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is also [[DATABASE/condition/Stunned|stunned 1]].
