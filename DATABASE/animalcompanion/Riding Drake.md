# Riding Drake

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Advanced Player's Guide|Advanced Player's Guide]] 
Your companion is a swift, flightless drake with limited intelligence, less vicious than most drakes but fiercely loyal to you. A riding drake has the dragon trait instead of the animal trait, but it otherwise functions normally as an animal companion.
**Size** Large
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws, **Damage** 1d8 piercing
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> tail, **Damage** 1d6 bludgeoning
**Str** +2, **Dex** +1, **Con** +2, **Int** -4, **Wis** +1, **Cha** +2
**Hit Points** 8
**Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Intimidation|Intimidation]] 
**Senses** darkvision
**Speed** 45 feet
**Special** mount
**Support Benefit** Your drake snorts fire in your foes' faces. Until the start of your next turn, each time you Strike while riding the drake and hit a creature in the drake's reach, the creature takes 1d4 fire damage from the drake. If your drake is nimble or savage, the fire damage increases to 2d4. 
**Advanced Maneuver** Breath Weapon

The riding drake breathes a 30-foot cone of fire, dealing 1d6 fire damage for every 2 levels the drake has to all creatures in the area (basic Reflex save). This uses a trained DC using the drake's Constitution modifier or an expert DC if the drake is specialized.
