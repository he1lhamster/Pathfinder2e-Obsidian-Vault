A seedpod within the chair bursts and uncoils, releasing a light clump of cottony material. Your rootball chair [[DATABASE/action/Leap|Leaps]] up to 30 feet vertically or horizontally and drifts down, sinking 5 feet for every 5 feet traveled horizontally and causing you to take no falling damage. The cottony material disperses when you land.
