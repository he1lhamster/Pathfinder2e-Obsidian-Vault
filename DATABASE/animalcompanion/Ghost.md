# Ghost

<span class="trait-uncommon item-trait">Uncommon</span>
**Source** [[DATABASE/source/Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]
Your companion is a [[DATABASE/monsterfamily/Ghost|ghost]], bound to an item in your possession. Due to this bond, your ghost companion can move beyond the area of a single dwelling, but it's easier to disrupt than most incorporeal creatures. A ghost companion can be formed from a humanoid, animal, or other creature. The ghost isn't sapient and is unable to speak with the living.
**Size** Small or Medium
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> ghostly touch (finesse, magical), **Damage** 1d8 negative (doesn't apply the ghost's Strength modifier)
**Str** -5, **Dex** +3, **Con** +0, **Int** -4, **Wis** +1, **Cha** +2
**Hit Points** 4
**Skill** [[DATABASE/skill/Stealth|Stealth]] 
**Senses** darkvision
**Speed** fly 20 feet
**Special** anchored incorporeality
**Support Benefit** Your ghost spooks and scares your foes as you attack them. Until the start of your next turn, if you hit and deal damage to a creature in your ghost's reach, the creature becomes [[DATABASE/condition/Frightened|frightened 1]].
**Advanced Maneuver** Telekinetic Assault

Your ghost unleashes a flurry of emotions, causing small objects and debris to fly about in a 20-foot emanation, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 2 levels the ghost has (basic Reflex save). This uses a trained DC using the ghost's Charisma modifier or an expert DC if the ghost is specialized.
