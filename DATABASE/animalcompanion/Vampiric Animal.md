# Vampiric Animal

<span class="trait-rare item-trait">Rare</span>
**Source** [[Book of the Dead]]
Your companion is a wolf, weasel, fox, or other predator with fangs and the blood thirst of a vampire. They often serve vampires who willingly shared their blood to bind the animal to their vampiric whims.
**Size** Small or Medium
**Melee** <span class="action-icon">1</span> jaws (finesse), **Damage** 1d8 piercing
**Str** +2, **Dex** +2, **Con** +1, **Int** -4, **Wis** +1, **Cha** +0
**Hit Points** 4
**Skill** [[Survival]] 
**Senses** low-light vision, scent (imprecise, 30 feet)
**Speed** 30 feet
**Special** Vampiric animal companions are particularly attuned to the scent of blood. If a creature has [[Persistent Damage]], your vampiric animal companion can smell the creature if it's within 120 feet rather than 30 feet.
**Support Benefit** When your vampiric animal senses blood it tears into your enemies. Until the start of your next turn, your Strikes that damage a creature in your vampiric animal's reach also deal 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]]. If your vampiric animal is nimble or savage, the persistent bleed damage increases to 2d6.
**Advanced Maneuver** Blood Feast

### [[Blood Feast]] <span class="action-icon">2</span>

---
Your vampiric animal companion attacks a bleeding foe and drinks its blood. Your companion attempts a Strike against a creature currently taking [[Persistent Damage]]. The Strike deals 2d8 additional damage. If the Strike hits and deals damage, your vampiric animal companion gains temporary Hit Points equal to half your level that last for up to 1 minute.
