**Support Benefit** The hand viciously batters the foes you attack. Until the start of your next turn, each time you hit a creature in the hand's reach with a Strike, the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the hand. If your hand is nimble or savage, the bludgeoning damage increases to 2d6.
**Advanced Maneuver** Grip Throat

The hand attempts to [[DATABASE/action/Grapple|Grapple]] a Medium or smaller creature by the throat. If the Grapple succeeds, in addition to the normal effects, the creature has difficulty speaking. While it remains [[DATABASE/condition/Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[DATABASE/condition/Restrained|restrained]] by the hand, it must spend an extra action to perform any action that has the verbal trait.
