# Pathfinder Second Edition Obsidian Vault
**Last update** - 01 December 23.
This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault with (almost) full database for Pathfinder Second Edition RPG up to Last Update date (all material before Remaster for now). The Vault was created using [Archive of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/) as the main source of content and information.

## What's inside?
All items stored in _DATABASE_ folder, sorted by type and located in corresponding folders. All pages have properties in the YAML format which can be used with different plugins (see example with 'Dataview' plugin below), you can change YAML visibility via '_Settings -> Editor -> Properties in document_'. Item pages have cross links to each other facilitating easy navigation.

### Dataview tables
It's greatly recommended to install community plugin [Dataview](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=dataview), so you can now create a tables of items and filter them by YAML frontmatter properties and have a quick access when you need to choose specific item, see example in '_Investigator Feats_'.

## Other Obsidian plugins for TTRPG
You can use Obsidian for your TTRPG notes, however it required some efforts and preparations beforehand. Below you can find some Obsidian community plugins which i found very helpful for taking notes.

1. [Templater](obsidian://show-plugin?id=templater-obsidian)
	Create your own templates for specific pages, for PC, NPC, quests, locations e.t.c. This allow you to quickly create pages according to a given template and properties in YAML format.

1.  [Obsidian Leaflet](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-leaflet-plugin)
	Allow you to create intercactive maps with your own custom marks, notes and links
